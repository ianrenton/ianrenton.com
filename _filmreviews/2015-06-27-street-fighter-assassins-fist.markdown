## Synopsis

One of the most exciting FIGHTING GAMES of the EARLY NINETIES gets a CINEMATIC PREQUEL. True to form, it is... KIND OF DULL and NOT REALLY EXCITING AT ALL?

## By the Numbers

* Dubious generic oriental accents: 1
* Alleged brothers of completely different race: 2
* Instances of *shoryuken* fanservice: 7
* Instances of *hadouken* fanservice: 24
* Haddock present in *haddockken*: Somehow 0?
* Health bars: They seem to have forgotten these too
* Characters in the film who are not martial arts masters: Maybe the old man in the hat? ...Maybe? Please don't be one?
* Training montage, in minutes: 152
* Not training montage, in minutes: 0
* Number of times better this film would have been if it was four minutes long and just had "Eye of the Tiger" in the background: 23
* Gaku Space: [GAKU SPACE](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2859177/?ref_=tt_cl_t6)
* Constipation level: OVER 9000!

## Overall: Oooooooonnnnnnn (three hours later) nnnnnnnnne / 5
