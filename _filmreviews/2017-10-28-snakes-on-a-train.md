## Synopsis

A WOMAN suffering from an acute case of MY BODY IS ACTUALLY SNAKES DISEASE gets on a TRAIN full of EXTREMELY PUNCHABLE STEREOTYPES. Her destination: LOS ANGELES, home of the only SHAMAN who can cure MY BODY IS ACTUALLY SNAKES DISEASE. Because it is caused by a VOODOO CURSE. OBVIOUSLY. Naturally, SNAKES break loose, on the TRAIN, until everyone has had just about ENOUGH OF THE MOTHERFUCKING SNAKES ON THE MOTHERFUCKING TRAIN. I, too, have had ENOUGH OF MOTHERFUCKING _SNAKES ON A TRAIN_.
