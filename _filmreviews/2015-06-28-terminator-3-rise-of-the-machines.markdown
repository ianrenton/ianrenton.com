## Synopsis

T1 was a CLASSIC. T2 was a MASTERPIECE. T3... is neither of those things. At last, a Terminator film that DESERVES the FRbtN treatment!

The year is 2004 and the future saviour of mankind is a DELINQUENT SOMEWHAT LARGER SHIT! Then some SEXY ANDROID ASSASSIN FROM THE FUTURE comes along to KILL EVERYONE EXCEPT HIM (until she finds him). ARNIE then shows up and after an hour and a half of RUNNING, GUNS, EXPLOSIONS and CONTINUITY ERRORS, the day is saved... aside from the nuclear holocaust. ...Sorry.
