## Synopsis

NICHOLAS CAGE has 2 dots in the TIME sphere, 2 dots in the CORRESPONDENCE sphere, and a 4-dot RECEDING HAIRLINE.  He spends most of the movie using his FUTURE-SIGHT SUPERPOWER to creep out then have sex with WOMEN rather than saving LOS ANGELES from a NUKE.

It becomes apparent that JACK BAUER would have been a far better choice than NICHOLAS CAGE in this situation.
