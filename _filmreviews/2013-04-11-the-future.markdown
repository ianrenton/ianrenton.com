## Synopsis

In the BEGINNING, there was ONE WORD. And that word was CAT.<br/>
Then there was LIGHT, and a CONCEPTUAL ARTIST proceeded to take a SELECTION OF MINDS and summarily fuck with them.<br/>
And FUTURE CAT had no meaning.<br/>
The ABILITY TO STOP TIME had no meaning.<br/>
TIME has no meaning.<br/>
And ZERO divided by ITSELF.<br/>
Even THE NARRATOR gives up before the end.
