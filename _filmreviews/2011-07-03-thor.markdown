### Synopsis

THOR, a TWELVE-YEAR OLD ARYAN SPACE PENIS, fights STUFF.  Then, he fights some MORE STUFF.  Then, he proceeds to fight YET MORE STUFF.  This counts as a VICTORY, because in the COMBINED WORLDS of MARVEL and NORSE MYTHOLOGY, how could it not?

ODIN and LOKI, the only two SENSIBLE CHARACTERS in this FILM, somehow come off looking bad.
