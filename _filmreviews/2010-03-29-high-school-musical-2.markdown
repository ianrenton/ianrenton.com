## Synopsis

The TEXT "A Disney Original Picture" appears on SCREEN.  The TEXT "Starring Zac Efron" appears on SCREEN.  Then the WORLD dissolves around you, your EYES glaze over, THOUGHT becomes MEANINGLESS, and the GREAT OLD ONES arise from SUNKEN R'YLEH to consume the SOULS of MANKIND.  All there is, is DARKNESS and PAIN.  You become NOTHING, for NOTHING is all that ever was.
