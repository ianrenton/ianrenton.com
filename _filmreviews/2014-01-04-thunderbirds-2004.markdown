Synopsis
--------

JONATHAN FRAKES and BEN KINGSLEY happen to a BELOVED 1960's CLASSIC of OVERLY OPTIMISTIC SCI-FI set somewhen around NOW. And so do BUSTED.

Meanwhile, PROFESSOR HIRAM 'BRAINS' HACKENBACKER is tied to a SOFA, which is later telekinetically lobbed through a WINDOW before they ALL go to LONDON for a WHEEL CLAMP DESIGNER'S NIGHTMARE.
