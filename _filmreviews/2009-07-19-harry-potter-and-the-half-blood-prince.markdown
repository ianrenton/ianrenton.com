title: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
---

Synopsis
--------

DRACO is evil, which we knew already.  SNAPE is evil, which we knew already.  Mostly, there is ANGST and teenage RELATIONSHIP DRAMA.  DUMBLEDORE is GANDALF.  SPIKE AERIS TIDUS DUMBLEDORE dies.  That's it.  Nothing really happens in this movie.

Question remains: If the greatest wizard evar can't defend himself against the instakill spell, why hasn't someone killed Harry with it yet?
