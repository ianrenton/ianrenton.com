## Synopsis

KEVIN JAMES, famed STAR of AWFUL MOVIES, is a ZOOKEEPER.  He fails so hard with WOMEN that the ZOO ANIMALS have to rescue him from his own INEPTITUDE by teaching HIM to GRUNT and PISS ON THINGS.  Somehow, this actually works.  Oh yeah, also the ANIMALS can talk.

Honestly, the only way this movie could be any worse is if it starred Adam Sandler.

WAAAAAAIT! It _did_ have bloody Adam Sandler in it.  The voice of the bloody monkey.  Right, that's it _Zookeeper_, you get a point docked for that.
