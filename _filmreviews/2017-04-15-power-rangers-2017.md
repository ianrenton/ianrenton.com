> A Film Review by Devo

## Synopsis

AAAH! After 65 million years, RITA is FREE! It's time to CONQUER EARTH... with GOLD!

Enter 5 OVER-BEARING, ANGSTY HUMANS WITH NOTHING IN COMMON, to wear COLOURFUL SUITS and pilot GIANT MECHS. They have THE POWER! (It says so in the title.)

## By the Numbers

* Commonalities between the heroes: 2. (They're human, and they're assholes.)
* Minutes of film dedicated to character development: A lot (is this really Power Rangers?)
* Townsfolk murdered in acts of back-alley dentistry: 13
* Black rangers: 2
* Pointless cameos: 2
* Gold eaten: Yes
* Goldar (in carats): 24
* Ridiculous combat backflips: 0
* Hilariously delayed impact jumps: 0

## Overall: 3 / 5

AY-AY-AY-AY-AY.
