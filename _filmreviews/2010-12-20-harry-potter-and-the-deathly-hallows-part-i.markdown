## Synopsis

A bunch of WHINY ANGSTY TEENAGERS fight with each other for TWO HOURS, somehow still managing to prevail against a bunch of MORE POWERFUL, COMPETENT ADULTS.  There is approximately a BEGINNING, but no END.  Suddenly, NAZIS!  MAGIC NAZIS. Thousands of them!

Also the WAND OF ULTIMATE POWAH looks like a SEX TOY, and VOLDEMORT is a HIGHLANDER.

## By the Numbers

  * Character deaths: 5
  * Days spent at Hogwarts: 0 (are these kids aiming for the all-time truancy record?)
  * One Rings: 1
  * Deus Ex Machinae: 1 (per scene)
  * Eyes in Pyramids: 0.7
  * Macguffins sought by good guys: 7
  * Macguffins sought by bad guys: 3
  * Macguffins sought by CardCaptor Sakura: 53 (clearly she is more hardcore)
  * LUNA: YES
  * Bellatrix / Hermione torture porn: over 9000
  * There can only be: 1

## Overall: 3/5
