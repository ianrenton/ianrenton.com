## Synopsis

A KID wakes up in a PRECARIOUS LIFT that crash-lands in "THE GLADE", named after the PLUG-IN AIR FRESHENER.

The GLADE turns out to be part of a LABYRINTH of BRUTALIST 60S ARCHITECTURE through which the KIDS must RUN FOR THEIR LIVES from BIOMECHANICAL ROBOTS controlled by SINISTER FORCES BEYOND THEIR UNDERSTANDING.

So, pretty much a normal day in SLOUGH.
