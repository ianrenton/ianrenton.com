## Synopsis

FAMOUS BULLSHITTERS the BROTHERS GRIMM bullshit their way from town to town, until they discover a RARE CASE OF NON-BULLSHIT.  They then proceed to SUCK for about an hour, until there's an ECLIPSE and the HEROES have to smash a MIRROR and flee a DISINTEGRATING TOWER and kiss the PRINCESS and... jeez, have these guys never played an RPG before? This should have been so much more obvious to them.

...What?

Also: IT'S NOT BEANS.  TRUST THE TOAD.
