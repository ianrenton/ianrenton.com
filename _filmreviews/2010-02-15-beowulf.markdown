Synopsis
--------

SOME DANISH BLOKE is tormented by 90s Industrial/EBM band GRENDEL.  From across the seas comes BEOWULF and GIMLI to save the day.  And get pissed.  Occasionally, they kill STUFF.  In the nude, 'cos that's just how BEOWULF rolls.  Then BEOWULF fights he and ANGELINA JOLIE's LIZARD-BABY and the LAWS OF PHYSICS at the same time.  Totally unexpectedly, he wins.
