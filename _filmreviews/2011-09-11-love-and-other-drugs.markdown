## Synopsis

CHESTY JAKE sells DELICIOUS XANAX and VIAGRA and also has SEX with A LOT OF PEOPLE.  Then CHESTY JAKE falls in LUUUUURVE with his FUCK-BUDDY, and it turns into ANOTHER BLOODY ROMANTIC COMEDY, and then into a DEPRESSING DOOM-FEST.

Goddamnit, EDWARD ZWICK, was foisting THE LAST SAMURAI with TOM FUCKING CRUISE on the world not punishment enough?
