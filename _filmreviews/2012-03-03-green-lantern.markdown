## Synopsis

COMICS, lol

## Overall: 3 / 5

Eric and I could not decide what the point was of the scenes where the Lanterns all shoot light into the sky together using their rings.  We came to the conclusion that it was because Ultimate Cosmic Power is boring if you can't occasionally use it to EJACULATE IN THE FACE OF GOD.
