## Synopsis

It's CHRISTMAS DAY and as far as I can tell this PILE OF UNMITIGATED SHITE is in fact the BEST THING on TV right now.

Oh yes, PLOT.

UNREALISTIC CASTAWAY BARBIE meets an INEVITABLE PRINCE who takes HER and her RIDICULOUS CADRE of TALKING ANIMALS back to his FANTASY KINGDOM. While there, SHE foils an EVIL PLOT and marries the PRINCE and discovers that SHE was a PRINCESS all along and OH GOD WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE
