Synopsis
--------

The Incredible Hulk (2008) (not to be confused with Hulk (2003), the Incredible Hulk (1987) or the Pretty Good, I Guess Hulk (2013).)

BRUCE BANNER blah blah blah SCIENCE blah blah BLOOD blah blah GREEN blah HULK SMASH.  Blah blah ANGST.  Some STUFF happens, and it was generally a bit better than the PREVIOUS ALMOST INDISTINGUISHABLE HULK MOVIE.

By the Numbers
--------------

* Punches thrown by Giant Mutant Things: Over 9000
* Purple stretchy pants: 1
* Armoured vehicles exploded: 7
* Abominations that involve bacon: 0
* Abominations that do not involve bacon: 1
* Guatemala: 1
* Guatepeor: 1
* Lolphysics moments: 2 (excluding the premise itself)
* HULK SMASH: 1
* Robert Downey Jrs: 1
* Samuel L. Jacksons: 0
* Movies with almost identical endings we still have to put up with before they finally make the damn SHIELD movie: 3?

Overall: 3 / 5
