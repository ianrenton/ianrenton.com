## Synopsis

JESSICA SIMPSON is inexplicably in YET ANOTHER MOVIE.  In a shocking break from tradition, she stars as HERSELF.  This time around, she crashes her CAR, inexplicably joins the US ARMY, and proceeds to FAIL for NINETY MINUTES.

Never in my life have I had so much sympathy for a drill sergeant.
