## Synopsis

JOHN TRAVOLTA and several nice people inhabit SMALL-TOWN AMERICA. Travolta gets hit by a SMARTNESS & KARMA BOMB (what a nice birthday present). It does NOT seem to help his LOVE LIFE... but it does help that of his HAM RADIO MATE. BRENT SPINER is the FBI. Oh and [JOHN DIES AT THE END](https://ianrenton.com/filmreviews/john-dies-at-the-end/).
