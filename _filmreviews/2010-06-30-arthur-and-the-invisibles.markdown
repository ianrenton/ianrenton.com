## Synopsis

In an attempt to save his HOUSE from being destroyed by EVIL BUILDERS, ARTHUR turns himself into a TROLL (the pencil-top kind) and goes to live in ALBION (the Fable kind).  Somehow, choreographed SWORD-FIGHTING to  the Bee Gees' STAYIN' ALIVE on top of a GIANT TURNTABLE is involved.

Then they go off to defeat the EVIL M, who is probably secretly MORIARTY (the LXG kind), only he's a PROTOSS (the Starcraft kind), rescue his GRANDFATHER, find the RUBIES, yadda yadda yadda.

Somehow, DAVID SUCHET, DAVID BOWIE, MADONNA and SNOOP DOGG are all in this movie.
