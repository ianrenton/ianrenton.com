![Cornflake Nests (as decorated by Joseph)](https://files.ianrenton.com/sites/recipes/Cornflake-Nests-300x216.jpg){: .right}

This is so simple it can barely be called a recipe, but my when my son was two he was utterly enthralled by making them (and eating all the ingredients as we progress), so I posted it here anyway.

### Ingredients

Makes 18.

  * 200g baking milk chocolate
  * 100g-ish cornflakes (I use Crunchy Nut so that I can face the prospect of having the rest of the box for breakfast)
  * One packet of mini eggs

### Recipe

  1. Break the chocolate into pieces, and place it in a bowl above a pan of simmering water.  Stir gently, and when completely melted, mix in the cornflakes until they're coated.
  2. Put a tablespoon of the chocolatey cornflakes in each paper cake case, making a dent in the middle.  Put a couple of mini eggs in said dent _et voil√°_!  Nest.
