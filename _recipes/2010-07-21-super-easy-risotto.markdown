This risotto recipe is quick, easy, simple and as authentically Italian as a Chicken Tikka Masala and five pints of Stella.  It's a favourite of my two-year-old son, as the preparation involves sharp knives, hot water, raw chicken and many other things with which toddlers can horribly damage themselves.

### ingredients

To serve 4 hungry people:
	
  * 2 chicken breasts
  * 3 leeks
  * about 20 button mushrooms
  * 1 large white onion
  * 500g Arborio risotto rice
  * 2 chicken stock cubes
  * cheese (optional)

### Method
	
  1. Finely chop the onion, slice the leeks and fry them both in a large casserole pot (with some olive oil) until they start to soften.
  2. Slice the chicken breasts, and add them to the pot.  Continue frying until they are mostly cooked.
  3. Halve the mushrooms, and add them to the pot.  Lower the heat to what would be a simmer.
  4. While the chicken and vegetables fry, make a pint of stock using the cubes.
  5. Add the rice to the pot.  Keep stirring to prevent it from sticking to the bottom, adding more oil if necessary.
  6. After a minute or so, pour the stock into the pot.
  7. Keep the mixture at a low simmer for 15 minutes, adding hot water when necessary to ensure that the ingredients stay covered as the rice absorbs water.
  8. Stop keeping the pot topped up with water, and continue simmering and stirring until all the water is absorbed or evaporated.  This should take another 5 minutes.
  9. Grate and stir in the cheese.
  10. Serve!
