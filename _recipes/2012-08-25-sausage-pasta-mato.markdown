A favourite of my son when he was three, and almost certainly a bastardisation of some actual Italian dish.

## Ingredients

To serve three:
	
  * 5 handfuls of penne pasta
  * 6 sausages
  * 400g tinned chopped tomatoes
  * 1 onion
  * 3 cloves garlic, crushed
  * 1 tsp mild paprika
  * 1 tsp dried oregano
  * 1 handful peas
  * 1 handful sweetcorn

## Recipe

  1. Heat a saucepan of water until it boils.  Add the pasta and reduce the heat to a simmer.
  2. Put the sausages under a medium grill.
  3. Finely chop the onion.  Place it in another saucepan with a little olive oil, and fry until the onion turns soft.
  4. Add the garlic to the onion, and fry for another minute.
  5. Add the chopped tomatoes, paprika and oregano to the onions.  Stir well and reduce to a medium heat.
  6. Add the peas and sweetcorn to the pasta, turning the heat up to get it back to a simmer again.
  7. Continue stirring the sauce and the pasta until the pasta is cooked.  Turn the sausages as necessary.
  8. Strain the pasta, and stir in the sauce.
  9. Serve the pasta in bowls, placing the cooked sausages on top.
