<h1>The Dorset Trading Card Game</h1>

<p><em>Work in progress. Probably can't be arsed to finish. Proceed with caution.</em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I got very bored and made a card game based on the best county in the world, Dorset. The rules are nicked from what I remember of Magic the Gathering from 15 years ago.</p>

<p>Each player begins with 20 life and a deck of 50 cards.  The deck can be built from any combinations of the cards in the set, up to five of each individual card. Decks might focus on one colour or use cards from all colours. They take turns in order.</p>

<h2>Card Types</h2>

<p>Each card is one of three types: Location, Character and Event. (These are pretty much Land, Creature and Instant for you M:tG fans.)</p>

<p>Location cards that are in play generate a number of points every turn that can be spent on any characters or events in your hand.</p>

<p>Points come in three flavours: Sea, Town and Country (Blue, White and Green). Each location may generate one or more these, and characters and events have a cost which may include one or more of them.</p>

<p>Once played, Location and Character cards stay in play unless something removes them.  Event cards are used and then discarded immediately.</p>

<p>Character cards can be used to attack an opponent, who uses her own Character cards to defend.</p>

<p>Location and Character cards may have special abilities which activate under certain conditions.</p>

<h2>Turn Order</h2>

<ol>
<li>At the beginning of a player's turn, she draws one card from her deck (or five cards, on the first turn).</li>

<li>If she has any Location cards in her hand, she may play one of them.</li>

<li>The location cards she has in play now produce their points. If she has any Character or Event cards in hand that, when their costs are added, cost equal to or less than the amount produced, those cards can be played.</li>

<li>Event cards can also be saved up and used later, including in opponents' turns, provided the player has enough un-spent points.</li>

<li>Character cards are played in front of the Location cards.  For Event cards, their ability happens immediately and they are then discarded.</li>

<li>The player may then assign any, all or none of the Character cards she has in play to attack one or more opponents.<li>

<li>Each defending opponent may then assign their own Character cards to block them as they wish.</li>

<li>Any attacking Characters that are not blocked do their Power in damage to the opponent.</li>

<li>For Characters that are blocked, the Power of attacker and the sum of the Powers of the defenders are compared. If the attacker has more power, the defenders are removed from the game. If the defenders combined have more power, the attacker is removed from the game.</li>

<li>Regardless of the outcome of the combat, blocked attackers do no damage to the opponent they targetted.</li>

<li>It is then the next player's turn.</li>
</ol>
