So, I got coaxed into going out for a drink tonight.  All's well and good until about half an hour after we get to the pub, when my flatmates decide they're going to go and catch a bus hlafway across town to go to the Cube (the Union nightclub).  That's not in itself a problem, except for the fact they didn't even ask if I was coming or not, and they didn't bother to wait to let me finish my drink...
