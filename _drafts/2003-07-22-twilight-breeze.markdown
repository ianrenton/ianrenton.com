*"Come with me in the twilight of a summer night for awhile<br/>
Tell me of a story never ever told in the past.<br/>
Take me back to the land<br/>
Where my yearnings were born<br/>
The key to open the door is in your hand<br/>
Now take me there<br/>
to the land of twilight..."*<br/>
&mdash; "The Key of Twilight", from .hack//SIGN

The breeze rustling the trees in the gardens by the sea... The villages on the hill sparkling like stars in the darkness... The town lit up with festival lights... The cold water lapping calmly against the side of the pier... And up here, just the wind...

No matter where I go, where I have to move to, I'll always remember this place.

And I will be back. One day, I'll come back here and I'll never leave...
