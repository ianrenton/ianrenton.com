Looks like my parents are coming to pick me up at about 10am on Friday morning.  So I guess I only have one day left here, and I probably need to spend it all packing and doing chores...  

Four months without my friends in Southampton, and without the DDRFUKkers too...  It'll be lonely, I think ^_^;  But never mind - the sun's still shining, life carries on... I shouldn't be unhappy about anything!  

*"Her eyes are starring at me<br/>  
Empty as the sky  <br/>
In this moment of tranquility<br/>  
I realize  <br/>
This is goodbye..."*<br/>
