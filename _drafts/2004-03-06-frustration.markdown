I don't know why, but... everything I do seems to be annoying me today.  IRC annoys me, Ragnarok Online (normally the most addictive thing ever) annoys me, even blogging annoys me.  It's dark outside, which is kinda' annoying for some reason, I've wasted an entire day doing nothing...  Any music I care to listen to annoys me, I feel like I've got a headache coming on, I've got too much energy... Argh!  This really is the worst feeling, because I know there's nothing I can do to sort it out, since it's so irrational...  

But there's a thought, actually.  I always tend to get headaches on Saturday nights.  Maybe it's sitting in front of a computer for practically every minute of the day from when I get up to when I go to bed that does it...
