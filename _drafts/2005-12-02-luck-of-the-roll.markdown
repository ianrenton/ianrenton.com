I love dice-luck sometimes.  I've barely ever had a good roll in Zane's game, and now tonight...  I roll seven 10-sided dice.  

The results: 6, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10.  

You know what they say about million-to-one chances, right?  

I guess it would be nice sometimes to believe in something like Karma.  It's a nice story, at least...  

Also today: Loneliness, hard work, Shaolin vs Lama, sparring and energy bolts.
