Righty, having now packed and gotten everything ready, I'm off to Maelstrom - or am I?  

Thanks to the ridiculous amount of stuff that had to be done today, and much complication with where I was to be staying tonight, we may not be leaving today after all.  I suppose we'll have to go tomorrow. Ah well, at least not going via Leicester will be cheaper...  

Also, congratulations to the stars of the '05-'06 academic year's 21st item of drama, aka "Chobits U".  You know who you are.  I guess it just goes to prove, this year really was explosive, right until the very end.
