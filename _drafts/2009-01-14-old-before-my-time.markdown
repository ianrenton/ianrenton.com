The flat upstairs appear to have acquired Guitar Hero: World Tour - judjing by the songs that I can hear all too clearly from my living room and bedroom.  I'm assuming their drummer plays on Easy, as once every two seconds or so, there's an almighty _thump_ that you can feel in the walls.

Were I childless, I'd head up there with beer and plastic guitars and ask if they had space for any more players.  But with Joseph sleeping, and my ever-present paranoia about him waking up, I've considered going up and asking them to turn it down.

How old am I supposed to be again? =S
