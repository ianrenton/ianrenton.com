Never has a weekend been shinier than that.  So much happiness in such a short space of time...  

Congratulations to the birthday boys and girls: Psyfira, Sam and my mum!  

Congratulations to, for obvious reasons, Andy and Rhiannon!  

And, thanks to Eric for coming to visit, and to everyone else who contributed to making this weekend really, really wonderful.
