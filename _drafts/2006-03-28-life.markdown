I have long suspected that real life is, in fact, an anime.  

I have now discovered the more worrying truth.  I have discovered *which* anime.  

Real life is, in fact, <a href="http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,3552,xdifgc,magikano.html">Magikano</a>.  

<i>EDIT: Real life is also <a href="http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,1442,qifeae,genshiken.html">Genshiken</a>, but I assume everyone realised this already.</i>
