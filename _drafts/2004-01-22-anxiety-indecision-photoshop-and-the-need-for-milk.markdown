<i>Anxiety</i>: First off, I've got a viva / viver / however you spell it for Electronics tomorrow afternoon, which'll probably be okay, but first I've got to catch up with my notes from lab sessions and the project.  Because I didn't really write anything much in my lab book as we were going along... so I've gotta catch up now before my lecturer asks to see it tomorrow.  Eeek!  But anyway, I've got the project circuit diagram printed off, so now all I have to do is write up some notes for the project and for two weeks of labs, pretending that I'm writing them at the time I was actually doing them... ^_^;;  I'll maybe write some stuff about the project tonight, then do the lab stuff tomorrow when I meet up with james before the viva / viver / haddock.  

<i>Indecision</i>: I've just done another quiz, and one question I was really stuck on how I should answer.  So I tried both, and it pretty accurately picks out the two sides of my personality...  

<i>Photoshop</i>:  Well, after the express Photoshopping a few days ago so that Adam could get a stepfile finished in time for the SM machine, I've done three banner and background 'shops tonight for Ant...  it's good fun, and I'm finally getting to realise fome of the power that Photoshop CS has - some of the stuff it can do that I never realised is quite frankly awesome.  

<i>The Need for Milk</i>:  Um... I haven't got any, and I can't be bothered to go down to the Co-op and get some... ^_^;; bleh, I suppose I'd better do really, no coffee or cereal for me otherwise...
