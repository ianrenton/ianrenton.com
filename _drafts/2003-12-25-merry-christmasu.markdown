(Wow, that was a lot of HTML tags for just one sen  

tence.)  Anyways, w00tage!  It's Christmas!  I'm now the new owner of aawesomely shiny digital radio, a really nice pair of boots, a couple of books, and an electronic toy dragon thingy (yes, I'm 18 going on 5 ^_^), and a stomach full of turkey and all the rest!  Mmm, good day~su...  It was good to see my grandparents (dad's side) too - my Grandad's just finished a five-week stay in hospital, and still doesn't look that well, but it was good to see him anyway!  

More of the same tomorrow when I go off to visit the other half of my family!  My parents are being boring and not coming =P but I'm going anyway.  More turkey, mmm...  

I hope everyone else is enjoying Christmas too!  

(I should really start doing some work someday soon, I've got loads to do.  Erk!  That isn't something I should be thinking about on Christmas day.)  I'm off to try and find something decent to watch on telly.  Mata ne~!
