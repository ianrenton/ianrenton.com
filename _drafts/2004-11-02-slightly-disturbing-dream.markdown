I've just had one of the most disturbing dreams I've had in a long time.  It was set in some kind of cathedral in which we (a cast made up of a mix of Physics students and DDRFUKkers) were slowly going completely insane.  While remaining sane myself - or so I thought - I watched everyone else spiral into utter incoherence...  Then, at the end, I found myself stood in a puddle waiting to hear a voice.  When no voice came, I tilted my head back and screamed "God has left the world!" as I finally lost the last of my sanity... and woke up.
