The number of my friends who have had work published grows once again, and I'm getting left behind!  Looks like I need to excavate some talent from wherever deep in my mind such a thing might hopefully lurk.  

On the subject of hope, I'm afraid my latest short-story-fragment-thing features rather a lack of it.  It's set in New Orleans.  This afternoon.  So, er, yeah.  Not the nicest of subject material, but still...  It begged me to write it, so I did.  I'll reiterate what's in the author's notes on the page itself:  This is fiction.  I am not in New Orleans, I have never been there, and I don't know anybody there.  All I know is what's appeared in the news and on blogs, and I've extrapolated bits of that in various ways to make a story.  

It's only on its second draft, so it's far from perfect.  All comments appreciated!
