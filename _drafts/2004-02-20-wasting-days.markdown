I'm really tired, and I have been all day... there's been nothing to do that I really want to do...  The only bit of useful work I did all day was do some graphics for Adam's latest stepfile, Love's Rebirth by Third Project.  It's been an interesting job trying to find out where this song originally comes from, and I haven't had a lot of success.  The only references to it I can find on the 'net are either about Rogue's TM4 entry or a BMS file for it.  I'd assumed from the BMS that it was originally from some flavour of Beatmania, but Fuse didn't seem to think so, so... I dunno ^_^  

Also, I'm definitely turning into a loner, I think.  I've stayed in my room virtually all day, only seen one of my flatmates once today, and I'm *glad* that no-one's asked me if I wat to go out tonight...
