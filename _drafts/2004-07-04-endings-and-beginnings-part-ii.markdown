So there it is, the ending of Stellvia - and it was everything I hoped for and more.  I just can't get over the flood of emotions that come from finally witnessing the awesome end of something that dominated my heart and mind as totally as Stellvia did...  

And of course, with every ending there comes a new beginning.  In a little over 10 hours' time, I start work again.  It's going to feel a little odd, I think...  I hope I can live up to everyone's expectations of me.  I want to get back into helping everyone on the project right away!  

Three months, huh...?  It feels longer - much longer.  It's getting lonely here already...
