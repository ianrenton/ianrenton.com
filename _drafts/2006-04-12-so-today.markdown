Today, I have been in the lab about as much as physically possible.  

I have friction marks on the palms of my hands.  

I have had to wash bits of dirt and sawdust out of cuts on my hands.  

The Physics department is now missing four hundred metres of enamelled copper wire.  

However!  The RoboFish project is starting to come together!  Only two months later than planned =p
