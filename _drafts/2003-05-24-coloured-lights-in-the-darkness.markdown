Sitting on the windowsill, staring out at the funfair lights across the water, and dreaming... It's a brief rest from the weekend's business. A meal out yesterday, barbecue and five visitors to the house tomorrow, Trawler Race Day on Monday, to Bournemouth for the night on Tuesday, then back to Weymouth to recover on Wednesday. And all that time, there's festivals and celebrations every day here...  

But for now, it's just dreaming in the darkness.
