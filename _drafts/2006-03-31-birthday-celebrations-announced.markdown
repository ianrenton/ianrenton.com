Ladies and Gentlemen, I am pleased to announce the imminence of the most fantastic and wonderous event of the year*, to be held here in the city of Southampton on 1st May.  

On the Common all through the afternoon and evening, there will be a celebration in honour of the beginning of summer and of my very own 21st birthday.  

Everyone is invited!
