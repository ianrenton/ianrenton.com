The air outside is hot, and thick, and full of the hands of dandelion clocks.  Yet it doesn't smell like thunder.  It smells like cities.  Strange smell.  

Also, our landlord is retarded.  He came 'round today to put new lino down in the kitchen.  Unfortunately he just put it down *on top of the old stuff*.  Good job.  Also he seems to have stolen the plank of wood we used to repair our bench.  I have no idea why.  

And, no matter how much chocolate I eat, I still feel hungry.  I have just realised that this is because it's 7pm rather than the 4pm I thought it was.  Arse.  Cooking time.
