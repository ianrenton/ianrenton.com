More DARPG stuff dumped from my brain onto paper - and thus also on the web.

Looking for feedback on these, by the way, from any roleplayers out there with a few minutes of spare time.  What have I missed?  What's explained well, and what's confusing?  Does it sound like a game system you'd want to use, or one to avoid on principle?  Any comments appreciated!
