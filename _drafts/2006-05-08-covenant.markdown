Squee, Covenant!  Despite a five-hour journey home that resulted in me smelling of bus engines and dealing with a stressed Domina, this evening was well worth it.  Also I have spent too much money today.  But still; squee, Covenant.  And also a contested minor squee for the support bands, "Pride and Fall" and the other one whose intro we missed.  Racheet and I agree on their unoriginality, but not on whether they are still good regardless.  

And now to bed, hoping I can get to sleep before dawn.  Goodnight, nya~!  

(Which reminds me, I wore cat ears to the gig.  This may make me "hardcore" \m/, although I seriously doubt it.  Although there was someone else there who had cat ears too, so I'm probably not all *that* weird.)
