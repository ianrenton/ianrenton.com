That was an absolutely awesome night!  It was Steve's birthday today, and we all went to see Supergrass live at the Guildhall in Southampton.  They were absolutely brilliant, and the warmup band - the 22-20's - were pretty damn good too!  All in all, not bad for my first concert ever ^_^  Afterwards, we intended to go to Jesters but seeing the size of the cue we all went to the Hobbit instead (a far better place, IMO).  While we were there... DRAMA, I'm afraid.  Vicky getting stressed, pints being thrown, and Steve getting very drunk indeed, although the last one's not necessarily a bad thing!  

Now the only annoying thing is, I have to be up in 5 hours' time... ;;_;;
