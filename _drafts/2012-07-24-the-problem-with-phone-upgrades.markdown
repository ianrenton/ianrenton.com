I am due to upgrade my mobile phone in a couple of months, so yet again it's time to pick the best of a generally bad bunch that I will be lumbered with for the next two years. Roughly speaking, my choice is:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>Phone</strong></td>
<td>Decent hardware</td>
<td>Software updates</td>
<td>Good battery life</td>
<td>Rootable in perpetuity</td>
<td>New and interesting</td>
<td>No need to change desktop OS</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Galaxy S III</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HTC One X</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Galaxy Nexus</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Droid RAZR MAXX</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iPhone 4S</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lumia 900</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>  

Please, phone manufacturers, make a phone that has more than three of the things in this table. Just for once.
