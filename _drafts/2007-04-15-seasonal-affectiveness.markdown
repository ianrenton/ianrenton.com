Spring has come around once more, and almost by surprise has filled me with the same emotions that it always has.  Sitting around in a t-shirt and shorts; walking home in the evening as the sun sinks low over the horizon, surrounded by a myriad of flowers; smiling and having fun.  Worldly worries just seem so much less worth worrying about now that Spring is here and the long hot days of Summer are on their way.  

It feels a little strange not being at University, though.  Once, mid-April would have been a time of manic preparation, a sense of things approaching a critical time.  Now, though...  Now there's nothing like that coming.  We're just going to head on into summer, with nothing much changing.  It'll be strange, that I'm sure of, but I don't think it'll be bad.  The really odd thing is going to be Summer passing away into Autumn with nothing changing.  

I wonder if that's how life is going to be?  

Still, there's little sense worrying about that now.  For now, there's five months of sunshine and happiness ahead!
