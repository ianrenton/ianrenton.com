Two hours left of 2008 (2G8?) and just like with Christmas, it sure as hell doesn't feel like it.  There were some fireworks, earlier, set off from the balcony of our flat block - but they didn't last long, and soon enough people disappeared back into the warmth of the indoors.  I suspect I'll end up staying awake until midnight, provided there's something tolerable on TV, but no-one around here is going out or doing anything.

Strangest of all has been explaining the fireworks to Joseph, who in all likelihood doesn't remember a time when it *wasn't* 2008.  I suppose a year will remain an unimaginably long time to him for many years yet.  And I guess when he's our age, a year will pass in a flash, barely noticed.

Still, what the hell, might as well raise a glass to the departed year - all two weeks of it - and to the year yet to come.  And don't forget to set your clocks forward a second at midnight! =p
