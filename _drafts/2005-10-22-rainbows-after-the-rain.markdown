As we headed into the city centre, the morning's wind-whipped sunshine turned quickly into a shower and then into rain.  It fell in sheets as we sheltered under the awning of a shopping arcade, and dripped around and through my umbrella as we dashed quickly from one shop to another.  

But by the time we walked home, the rain had once more been replaced by only dampness and golden light.  Over in the east, a rainbow shone brightly as it hung over the city.
