(Insert Big Brother voice-over) It's day three in the Hinata Inn, aka Flat Four, and that lazy bastard Ian has got off his arse and done something!  

Yep, today... *shock* I... did my laundry.  I attempted some revision, but I feel as if I know most of it already, to be honest...  Then again, I think I've more-or-less always felt like that before exams...  

Tomorrow, I'm gonna wake up early, do revision, and then bake a cake when I get fed up...  That's the plan, anyways.  But for now, I'll celebrate my last hour online tonight with a pint of Stella and a 200g block of chocolate.  /me prods his waistline, hoping it will obey his will and not expand...  

Also, while I was waiting for my laundry I read some more of "The Matrix and Philosophy".  I swear every time I read books like that, I feel more and more that I'd like to be a Zen Buddhist...  (He says while drinking alcohol - oh well...)
