The sudden proliferation of peoples' syndicated tweets from sources such as [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com/) and [Fallen London](http://echobazaar.failbettergames.com/) annoys me far more than it should.  Any more sensible old grouch would pick up his pipe, don slippers and write a strongly-worded letter to the local newspaper about how this 'checking in' business is corrupting society.

Instead, I made my Twitter client block them.  Also, you can now do it too!

[SuccessWhale](https://successwhale.com/) users will now see a link at the top-right of the interface called 'Manage Banned Phrases'.  Clicking it will take you to a page where you can specify a semicolon-separated list of things you don't want to see, such as "`4sq.com;fallenlondon.com;bieber`".  Once confirmed, any tweets in any timeline that are sucky enough to contain one of these phrases will be hidden from your view.

Twitter: now 12% less full of shite!

An extra feature has been rolled into this release, which is the 'Reply All' button.  It looks like this: ![](https://successwhale.com/images/replyall.png)  It only appears where two or more people are having a conversation (three or more if you're included too).  Clicking on it starts a reply to everyone mentioned, not just the tweet's originator.  So if @Alice is talking to @Bob, and you click 'Reply All' on one of her tweets, your entry box will then read "@Alice @Bob".

So that's version 1.1.  Share and enjoy!
