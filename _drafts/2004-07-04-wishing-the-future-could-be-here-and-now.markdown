I suppose it's a sign that I was enjoying myself, when I didn't think to check what time it was until I noticed it was already sunrise...  (And yet, I still feel wide awake now even though I didn't sleep last night...)  

I wonder why it is that I feel really strongly that I want to stay in Southampton, to be there as long as possible... Even though I hardly know most of the people I've met there, everyone's so nice... and I want to become friends with them all...  

I can't help but feel as if I'm being left behind for the next three months.  But I guess that's a selfish thought that I shouldn't have...
