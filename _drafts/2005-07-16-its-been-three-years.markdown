It's been three years since the summer that made this song mean something to me...  Three years since that summer I used to refuse to talk about, since that summer that either broke me or fixed me.  

I guess a lot of time has passed, since then.  I'm a different person now, I'm sure of that much.  And it doesn't haunt me anymore.  

I guess that's progress.
