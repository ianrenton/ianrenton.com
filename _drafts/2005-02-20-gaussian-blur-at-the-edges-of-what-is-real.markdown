In character, there was a party.  Out of character, there was a party.  

In character, there was alcohol.  Out of character, there was alcohol.  

In character, I seem to have managed something that I'm still incapable of out of character.  

Maybe this is an experience that'll make that kind of thing easier for me in "real" life.  

But then, maybe it won't.  Kotori's world is very different from mine.  

Or... then again... maybe it isn't.  

Characters mirror characters, personalities mirror personalities, events mirror events.  

Maybe it might be possible for Ian, now.
