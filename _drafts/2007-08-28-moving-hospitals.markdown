Quick update - we're transferring to Bournemouth hospital this afternoon.  Unfortunately, due to an outbreak of something-or-other, we won't be allowed visitors there.  I'll post if this changes, but at the moment it looks like 2-4 this afternoon in Poole is the last time anyone can visit us.  Sorry!
