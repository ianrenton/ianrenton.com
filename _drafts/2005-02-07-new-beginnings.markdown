I can't really be bothered to do a proper update right now, but still...  

Last week was insanely busy, despite the fact I had no work to do.  I don't think I managed much more than a few hours to myself over the whole week, and...  I guess that's probably a good thing since it meant I was spending so much time with everyone else, but it's meant I've had no chance to relax at all.  I feel like I need to be on my own for a while, but that might not be good.  I don't know.  

Had my first lecture of the new semester this morning.  Optics isn't my favourite subject, but the course doesn't look too hard and the lecturer's pretty good.  So I might actually make a few of my 9am lectures this time around!  

Playing Kotori has possibly become more instinctive than playing Ian now.  I'm not sure if that's good or not.  Talking about Kotori's emotions out-of-character last night resulted in me admitting the existence of my two pseudo-secrets to Andy and Mark.  I'm not sure that letting them know the details would be wise, but for some reason I feel I ought to.
