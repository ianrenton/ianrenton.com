Exams were a bit evil.  

Conception (the gaming con, believe me all the jokes have already been made) report coming soon.  It was really, really good.  

Lectures start tomorrow, eek.  

I'm really, really busy.  It's kinda' scary.  

<b>Attention Changeling Players!</b>  

Pre-game preparation is gathering speed.  I'll probably be up and ready to run in a couple of weeks.  Watch this space for setting and game information over the next week or so: => <a href="http://www.rpol.net/game.cgi?gi=15577&gn=Changeling:+In+Love+and+War">http://www.rpol.net/game.cgi?gi=15577&gn=Changeling:+In+Love+and+War</a>  

Also if you're interested in playing or have already invited, please Request Access on that page (you'll need an RPoL account) or comment here.  

Any objections to running this game on RPoL are welcome, but now is your chance.
