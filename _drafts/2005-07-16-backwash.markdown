Try as I might to live here and call this place home, it's not.  Southampton is home.  

Visiting there yesterday and today really made the point to me, I think.  Being there, with everyone, and seeing the city in the bright summer sunshine again...  I want to go back, I want to stay there, forever, but I know it can't be forever even if I try.  

In a way I wish I could make Bournemouth feel like home.  It really should, I lived here for 17 years.  But it doesn't, and I don't know why...  

Heh, I suppose I shouldn't be making depressing posts like this after the really fun night I had last night.  It was really, really good to see everyone again...
