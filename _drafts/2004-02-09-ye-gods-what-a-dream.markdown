Ugh...  I just dreamt that I was dying of cancer and had one day to live, and of the things I did in that day...  And then, I didn't die that night, so I had another "final" day...  And from that dream, I'm now sure of two things...  that I want Dreaming Awake (finished or not) to carry on forever, and that my parents and I love each other more than anything else in the world...  

*just woke up, and is still crying*  

Waah, I have t3h messed up dreams...
