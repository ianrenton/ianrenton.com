Up until now, I would have described <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentai">sentai</a> shows as being a bit weird, not really my thing.  

However, I have just watched <a href="http://tvnihon.dragoneye.ca/torrents/[T-N]Garo_24[275E3A1C].avi.torrent">Garo episode 24</a>.  The plot of the first part of this episode goes thusly:  

Main characters versus Gothic Lolita.  

Gothic Lolita wins.  

The universe suddenly just became more... right.
