*"Forever Love, Forever Dream<br/>
Only overflowing thoughts of love<br/>
Please bury all of the terrible, sorrowful time<br/>
Oh tell me why<br/>
All I see is blue in my heart<br/>
Will you stay with me<br/>
Until the winds pass<br/>
All my tears overflow again<br/>
Forever Love, Forever Dream..."*<br/>
&mdash; X, "Forever Love"
