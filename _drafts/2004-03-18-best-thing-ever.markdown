.hack//Liminality.  It's so messed up, it's great!  

Also, I spoke to my mum on the phone today... seems she wasn't really that upset after all.  She also seemed encouraging about me trying to get a house here with Mark and Raquel, which is good.  I'm off to bed early tonight, since I wasn't feeling too good which means I've left all my work until tomorrow!  Hurrah.
