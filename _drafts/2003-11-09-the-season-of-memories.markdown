*It's Winter-fall<br/>
Red skies are gleaming - oh -<br/>
Sea-gulls are flyin' over<br/>
Swans are floatin' by<br/>
Smoking chimney-tops<br/>
Am I dreaming...<br/>
Am I dreaming...?<br/>
Dreaming...<br/>
So quiet and peaceful<br/>
Tranquil and blissful<br/>
There's a kind of magic in the air<br/>
What a truly magnificent view<br/>
A breathtaking scene<br/>
With the dreams of the world<br/>
In the palm of your hand<br/>
Dreaming...<br/>
A cosy fireside chat<br/>
A little this, a little that<br/>
Sound of merry laughter skippin' by<br/>
Gentle rain beatin' on my face<br/>
What an extraordinary place!<br/>
And the dream of the child<br/>
Is the hope of the man...*<br/>
