So, that's it.  No more Gateley Hall, no more Flat 4.  

And so, it's Summer again.  Hardly seems like any time at all since last time around, does it?  And yet, a lot of things have happened this year, and a lot has changed.  

Until late September to early October sometime, I'll be effectively without internet access.  MSN will be pretty much no-go for me, and I'll only be able to be on IRC when I visit other peoples' houses.  E-mails I should be able to check from work once or twice a day, though.  LiveJournal updates will probably come in weekly blocks, since I'm not sure my boss would take kindly to me sitting at the internet machine blogging away every day.  

So, until I see you all again...  

**Have a great summer!!**
