I got some new Tarot cards today - for once, a normal set. I've gotta say, I'm really impressed. The deck's called the Celtic Dragon Tarot, and the artwork is very nice indeed!  

Looking at them though, reminded me of the deck I made for myself, just over a year ago now. I remember the cards that were in it, and what they symbolised... it seems I really have changed a lot. The anger, the frustration, the feeling that things are approaching a moment of climax, the feeling that things would soon change... I don't think I feel any of that now. It must have been months since I was angry... and now I just want happiness to last forever...
