### Part I - How Not to Wake Up  

I planned to wake up at 9am today.  I actually woke up at 1pm, thus missing Kung Fu for the third week in a row.  My apologies to everyone whom I'd told that I'd be there...  

### Part II - Productiveness  

This afternoon I got quite a bit of work done, since I'm really lagging behind on lots of my work at the moment.  Also made a Star Ocean 3 wallpaper, since I'm obsessing about the game at the moment.  

### Part III - A Bus Journey in the Rain  

So, Racheet and I decided to go to a gig in Winchester this evening.  I first found out about this at 2pm and it started at  8, but never mind - on-the-spot decisions are fun!  Anyways, after an hour or so of travelling, we found ourselves at a seemingly-deserted pub in Winchester.  Hidden away somewhere, however, was the music room.  Once we found that, it became much more like what I was expecting...  Although upon stepping through the door I wasn't expecting J-Rock.  

### Part IV - Syaranosui  

Whoah.  Stunning... In appearance and talent.  I assumed them to be a local band, seeing as they're playing in a pub to 40 people and brought along a stack of their CDs to sell.  Upon later inspection, <a href=http://www.syaranosui.com>their website</a> lists a price for their CD in Yen.  So, they're very much an enigma to me.  I bought the CD though, they're really good!  

### Part V - Trauma Pet  

Another warm-up band - really quite good (I bought their CD too) but IMHO not as good as the last.  

### Part VI - Goteki  

Part two of tonight's enigma.  I always assumed they were famous, and I keep meeting people who've heard about them.  So seeing them playing to 40 people in a pub was weird!  I'm still unsure as to how famous they actually are.  Anyway, popular or not, I think they're really good!  Amusing, too. ^_^  They're the band that I went to see, and I certainly wasn't disappointed!  

### Part VII - House Party  

One bus trip back to Southampton, and Racheet and I stopped by at a house with some of the people who'd been at the gig.  As usual, I feel horribly out of place since I don't know anyone, but I had fun nonetheless!  Being my normal stupid self I've forgotten most of the peoples' names already, but at least it's another seven or eight faces that I recognise in what I guess is the Southampton goth scene.  

All in all, a fantastic even  

ing!  

Holy crap, it's half past three...  That's not good ;;_;;
