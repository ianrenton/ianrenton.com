"Forgotten Children" is an idea that's been kicking around my head for a long while, and it's always felt like it ought to be novel-length, albeit possibly a short novel.  For several years I've laboured under the misapprehension that it might be publishable, and that if it was, I should keep it to myself until it's done.

However, it's become abundantly clear that if there's no kind of pressure on me, I just _don't do it_.  Thus, I'm going to serialise the damn thing on the internet.  Hopefully, the fact that a few people out there might be reading it and waiting for the next chapter will encourage me to get off my arse and write.  I can't promise my ability to write it quickly, or frankly even well, but I'm going to put it out there in case someone enjoys it.
