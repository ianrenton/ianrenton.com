It's dark now, when I get up, and it doesn't feel like morning at all.  The feeling was even stronger today, though - it feels almost as if my mind and body are somehow separated.  I don't feel that I'm hearing all the sounds that I should hear, nor seeing all the things that I should see, and when I try to move it's as if there's some delay between thinking about it and it actually happening.  I can probably put it down to having a cold and only having had about four hours' sleep last night.  But regardless of how I feel now, I wouldn't have missed that phone call - the reason for my lateness in getting to bed - for anything.  

Also, would you like some angst with that?  Make it super-size?  Have a new fragment, "<a href="/fiction/memories-of-a-girl">Memories of a Girl</a>".
