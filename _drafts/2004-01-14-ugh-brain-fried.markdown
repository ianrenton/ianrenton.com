Yay~su... Exalted went on until 2am yesterday, then add on the walk home, getting ready for bed, and waking up at 7.30 this morning - I got three and a half hours sleep last night!  Since I did manage to get up at 7.30 I made the effort and went in for my Maths tutorial, but I couldn't think straight the whole time, and kept closing my eyes...  That's why I gave up on the other two lectures that I had (in theory) today, since I really would have just fallen asleep.  

I'm back home now and waking up a bit, but... I think I'll go to bed for the afternoon, then wake up for dinner and do my work afterwards... and ARGH!  One of these days I'll have the *time* to start revising for my exams...  first one's on Monday, and I still have two of this week's problem sheets to finish before I can start revising...  Why don't they cut *down* the amount of work we have to do towards the exam period!?
