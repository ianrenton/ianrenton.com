Right, Halloween party on Saturday and I have no idea what to go as.  Here's the suggestions so far:  

Since some partygoers are going as various of the Endless, <b>Neil Gaiman</b> has been suggested.  

<ul><li>Pros: I already look like him, no real costume required, Eric and Domina want me to.</li>  

<li>Cons: Not scary, kind of a cop-out.  Having stubble and taking my glasses off isn't really a costume.  Will have to explain a lot.</li></ul>  

Vaguely Steampunk <b>Airship Navigator</b>  

<ul><li>Pros: I have the clothes etc. already, can play it as a character</li>  

<li>Cons: Not scary.</li></ul>  

Ultimate terror-causing <b>Goth/Townie Hybrid</b>!  

<ul><li>Pros: Not too hard to costume, giant ankh bling, have been thinking of this for years</li>  

<li>Cons: Not actually all that funny, will have to explain a lot.</li></ul>
