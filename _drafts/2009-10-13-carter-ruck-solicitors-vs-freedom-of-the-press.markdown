**EDIT: [Victory](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/13/guardian-gagged-parliamentary-question).**  Original post follows:

In the unlikely event that you haven't already heard this, considering the *crosses self* blogosphere and Twitter are _on fire_ with it:

The Guardian newspaper has been blocked from reporting on a question being put to the House of Commons tomorrow, by London solicitors Carter-Ruck representing their client [Trafigura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafigura).  This explicitly goes against the long-established right of the media to report on the House of Commons, and thus on our right to know what our elected representatives are doing on our behalf.  It is a worryingly successful attack on the freedom of the press, and naturally the internet has taken it upon itself to get the word out, at the expense of Carter-Ruck's reputation if necessary.  (Trafigura's reputation is [probably dead already](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire_toxic_waste_dump).)

The question that the Guardian is forbidden from reporting on is believed to be "question for written answer" number 61 on [this list](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&STEMMER=en&WORDS=trafigura&ALL=trafigura&ANY=&PHRASE=&CATEGORIES=&SIMPLE=&SPEAKER=&COLOUR=red&STYLE=s&ANCHOR=muscat_highlighter_first_match&URL=/pa/cm200809/cmordbk2/91013o02.htm#muscat_highlighter_first_match).  The Minton Report referred to in this question can be found [here, on Wikileaks](http://is.gd/4h8cc).
