So, I try to cheat the system. It's virtually impossible to do the laundry here without a two hour wait, even at times when most people have lectures.  So, my solution?  Go at a time when people not only don't tend to go, but when others would think it's a ludicrous time to do laundry.  So, at 8:30 this morning, I go and do my laundry.  Success!  The laundry room's empty, I manage to wash and dry in under an hour.  

And then the problem.  It seems that at that time of the morning... they don't have the gas for the dryers turned on.  Yay for soaking wet washing, and for having three impromptu washing lines made of plaited string tying together every suitable handle in my room.  ARSE.
