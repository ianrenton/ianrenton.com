Dear lazyweb,

I'm off on a business trip on Tuesday, which involves amongst other things a couple of 18-hour plane/taxi trips on my own.  I'm not sure I can read a book for that long straight, so I'm thinking of buying a DS or PSP to pass the time.

First question: What's the battery life of each like?

Second: Can anyone name me a good time-sink game for either?  Ideally RPG, Strategy or the combination thereof.  Caveat: I've played Disgaea, Advance Wars, Fire Emblem, and most of the Final Fantasy series to death already.  I haven't played FF Tactics Advance though - any good?  Are there any non-Disgaea Nippon Ichi SRPGS for handhelds?
