Today, I managed three momentous feats.  

First, I used the word "mothership" in an appropriate context in a technical document.  

Secondly, for the first time in near-enough ten years, I bought a piece of software*.  With actual money!  Crazy.  

Thirdly, I found something I know that Wikipedia doesn't! Shame I can't add it though. =S  

* <a href="http://www.reflexvision.net/">Reflex Vision</a>, by the way.  I'd had enough of getting by at work with shite freeware Exposé clones, and figured £5 wasn't too bad for a working one.
