Didn't wake up until midday today, in the cause of getting some more dreaming done.  

I can't remember exactly where the first dream started, but I remember it from the point where I and a few other adults were looking after a bunch of kids in the playground.  I started to have a go on the slides and things myself.  Then I got to a bit where there were hoops hanging from ropes from a bar overhead, and you had to cross from one platform to another while holding on to the hoops.  Kind of like that game on Gladiators, only without a disturbingly lycra-clad opponent.  Anyway, it was really difficult - I'm not sure if the kids could manage it, since the hoops were so far apart.  I did okay, though, except for at one point the rope holding the hoop I was on stretched, and I ended up standing on the ground, holding the hoop in my hand and looking silly.  

I went back to minding the kids for a while until a TV filming crew turned up, at which point I went inside.  Inside the thatched-roof cottage next to the playground, there was a lecture about magic going on in a huge lecture theatre, which was boring so I left.  I opened the door to the outside again, and nearly tripped over a guy spreading salt in front of the door.  After letting him past, I decided that I didn't want to step in the salt so I jumped over it.  

There were two little hills ahead of me, one with the playground on it and the other empty.  I walked up to the top of the empty one and looked around, and saw that the guy spreading salt had drawn a big infinity-symbol-like-thing around the two hills which felt really icky, and I knelt down and put my hands down...  And, in a horribly disconcerting way, my hands and arms and body were pulled through the ground and everything blurred and I woke up.  

If I recall correctly, the last part of the dream - from walking out of the cottage door to being sucked through the ground - repeated again, exactly the same as before.  

My second dream is a slight variation on one I've seen before.  As before, we all got a train to Bristol University, which looked almost exactly like Southampton Uni except that the train station was where Southampton's main Union building is.  And, like before, I found myself without any clothes - although some boxers appeared at some point.  

We decided to go to the Union shop - which for some reason was up on the equivalent of where Burgess Road would have been at Southampton - and get me some clothes.  On the way we noticed two Maelstrom characters, Twig and Wildwood, but we didn't say hello.  

Then, on the way up the side of the University-Road-equivalent we met Pete, who seemed to be some kind of security person at the Uni.  We explained the problem to him, and... I woke up.  

Much fun.
