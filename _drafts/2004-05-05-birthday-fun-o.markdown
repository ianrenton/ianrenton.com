This afternoon, Gamesoc!  This evening, an anime showing!  Tomorrow, going out with my flatmates!  Super fun days!  

The downside, though, is with that much time being taken up with celebrating and doing stuff, I have a vast amount of work to do in very little time ^_^;  Oh well... can't be helped I suppose.  I wanted to bake a cake today, but I'm not going to have time to do that, either...  

(And if you're wondering about what I've got set as my mood for this entry - I don't know why I feel nervous, I just do.)
