Twelve hours until the start of this weekend's London festivities which will remove what little remains of my bank balance.  

In other good news, I now have my start date sorted out for my job this summer, so at least I know what's going  on!  Also my second sponsorship cheque should arrive soon now.  

In yet more random news, I've found something else I shouldn't buy but want to - it's shiny, extremely gaudy-looking, rather cheap and light enough to use... pretty much perfect for sword-dancing fun.  <a href="http://www.blades-uk.com/large_pic.php?product_id=254">http://www.blades-uk.com/large_pic.php?product_id=254</a>.  My parents would probably make a fuss though, so I'll probably get around to buying it when I move house in October.
