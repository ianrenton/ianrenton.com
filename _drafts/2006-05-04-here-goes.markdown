As the sun rose, bright and warm, over the city of Southampton, so did I.  This is my last day of lab work on the RoboFish project - a maximum of five hours remain for the project to get as close to completion as it will ever be.  

Here goes nothing, and here's hoping I get as much luck as I need.  

Onwards!
