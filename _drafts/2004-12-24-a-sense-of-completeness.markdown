Nothing ever changes, huh?  For a while I'm back with everyone in Bournemouth.  Today was perhaps more of a reminder than a reunion - the day went just like they always used to, and left a warm feeling behind in our hearts.  Walking home at the end of the night, I felt warm despite the cold, sober despite the alcohol, surrounded by friends although alone, and if I closed my eyes I could almost feel the world shining and beautiful around me.  As if, with every step, I was coming closer to the world around me.  As if I was complete.
