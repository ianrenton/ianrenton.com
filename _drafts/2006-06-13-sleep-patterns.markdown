So, I made it back from Maelstrom.  It was very definitely an awesome weekend.  Unfortunately, the transition from Maelstrom sleep patterns (3am-8am) to crashing day sleep patterns (3am-noon) seems to have screwed me up completely.  At 9pm today it still felt like lunch time, and now a two-hour phone call with Eric has scrambled my brain I'm feeling tired and ill.  

For the super bonus, I have to be up and cooking at 10am tomorrow, for RABIES 2.  Hope to see all you Southampton folk - all 24 of you, at last count - there!  Don't forget to bring your food money and an empty stomach, as Alex's fridge is full of all the lovely food that Andy and I will be making for you!
