Joseph has a bad effect on me.  =S

So, I sort of want to write a post-apocalyptic episode of Thomas the Tank Engine where a botched nuclear test leaves the humans dying of radiation poisoning, and the trains spend the humans' last days convincing them to attach spikes and guns to all the engines so they can duke it out Mad Max style.

Is this:

1) The best idea since sliced bread,
2) The worst idea since the siege of Stalingrad,
3) Not the kind of thing I should ever discuss in public

And also:

1) Protected under Fair Use laws,
2) Going to get me a Cease and Desist letter faster than you can say "Holy shit Gordon, where did you get that SCUD launcher from?"
