Now I think about it, it's dawned on me what this costume I'm wearing reminds me of - Flonne from Disgaea.  Except my bows are orange and red, not blue.  

Pictures soon, so you can all fear...  

EDIT: Actually, now I'm properly wearing this, I'm really embarassed about it ;;_;;  It looks far too much like a dress rather than robes.  Still, no matter how girly it looks, I think Yang is still a better prospect than Yaoi.
