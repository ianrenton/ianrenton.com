The overcast skies scatter the light, dampening out the scenery into shades of grey.  The rushed half-hour walk to catch a cancelled train fills my mind with fuzzy interference.  And on the train I eventually caught, the noise of wheels on tracks, the noise of the electronic announcements, the noise of shouting children and mumbling old men...  They all blend together into a maelstrom of noise, blocking out the signal of thoughts from my head.  

A few raindrops lightly touch the window through which I stare at a dull shadow of a world.  

That damnable kid screams, time after time, always when I'm least prepared for it.  

I'm going to be late again.
