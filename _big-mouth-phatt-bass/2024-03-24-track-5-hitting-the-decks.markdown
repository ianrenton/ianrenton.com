Now we have demonstrated audio output through the Billy Bass speaker, it's time for everyone's favourite early 2000s passtime: *pirating MP3s* [^1].

I downloaded [Phatt Bass' original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca-r-U5ybx4&pp=ygUYd2FycCBicm90aGVycyBwaGF0dCBiYXNz) using a YouTube to MP3 site&mdash;I won't link to one here as it'll be gone by the time you read this, replaced with a dozen more just like it.

Before editing my pun into the audio, I wanted to separate vocals and music into separate tracks to make editing easier. Given the general poor quality of Billy Bass audio output, I'm not sure why I bothered, but I did. Luckily, another thing the web is now flooded with is websites to extract vocals from music using "AI". I tried [vocali.se](https://vocali.se/) and [vocalremover.org](https://vocalremover.org/), both of which allow limited free processing and file downloads; they both performed pretty much as well as each other.

My final source of audio was a text-to-speech voice saying "bass" (as in the fish). I played with several and settled on [elevenlabs'](https://elevenlabs.io/)'s "Michael" voice. I had to make the text "bass fish" to get it read in the correct sense, then chop off the word "fish". Despite choosing it for how deep the voice was, I still had to deepen it further to make it sort-of match "*Phatt Bass* guy".

A few minutes in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) later, and... I realise I'm no good at this. Despite joking that this project should happen 20 years ago, I've spent none of that time learning audio editing, so of course I'm terrible.

*An hour* later, and I've decided this is good enough for a poor fish pun through a dodgy speaker:

Now let's get music and fish movement matched up!
