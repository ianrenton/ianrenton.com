Plug-in breadboards are convenient for prototyping, but there's no chance that this mess is ever going to fit back inside the Billy Bass enclosure:

In future, I plan to rework the breadboard into a smaller section of perfboard mounting the ESP32 and MP3 boards, mounted on one side of the enclosure, then mounting the L298M motor driver on the other side. Even still, I am not 100% sure I can make it all fit, but this page will be updated in future with my progress.
