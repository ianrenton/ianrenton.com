Plug-in breadboards are convenient for prototyping, but there's no chance that this mess is ever going to fit back inside the Billy Bass enclosure:

![A breadboard and a mess of wiring connected to two halves of a Billy Bass](/projects/big-mouth-phatt-bass/13.jpg){: .center}

In future, I plan to rework the breadboard into a smaller section of perfboard mounting the ESP32 and MP3 boards, mounted on one side of the enclosure, then mounting the L298M motor driver on the other side. Even still, I am not 100% sure I can make it all fit, but this page will be updated in future with my progress. Another alternative may be to extend the wire looms with JST XH connectors out through a hole in the rear of the case, and have the breadboard permanently sited outside the enclosure&mdash;not as neat, but it does show off what's happening.
