This page provides a list of all the blogs and websites that I regularly read, and subscribe to RSS feeds from. I have fond memories of the early 2000s when we all blogged, before everything became social media, before the corporations gobbled up our thoughts and algorithmically filtered them for others. I remember when the web was good, and we found interesting people from pages like this. I hope you find some interesting people here too.
