This page shows some of the designs that this website has had through its history as "The Mad Marmablue Web Portal", "Only Dreaming" and as IanRenton.com. A lot of awful stuff from my younger years is on display below!

### April 1998

My first foray onto the Web was a site created in MS Word. It was everything you imagine and more&mdash;animated GIF backgrounds, auto-playing MIDI music and all. Mercifully, no content appears to have survived on the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org/web/) or elsewhere. I believe its original URL may have been `http://members.tripod.com/__lep`.

### 2000-ish

I learned how to use frames, and how to code my HTML from scratch (by copying other sites), so there was another version of the site that proudly sported a "built in Notepad" badge. I remember a drop-down menu for navigation, a second drop-down to choose the auto-playing background MIDI (what luxury!) and a white on black/blue colour scheme, all of which may have been "borrowed" from emulation site [Zophar's Domain from about that era](https://web.archive.org/web/20000510041717/http://www.zophar.net/). This version of my site was hosted at `http://www.geocities.com/marmablue`, and no content has survived.

### February 2001

This is possibly the third version of the "Mad Marmablue Web Portal". It was a static site and had a Javascript-based tree menu on the left, which the Internet Archive has not preserved. Again I learned by ripping off other sites' code.

This version (or variations of it) seemed to jump between a number of free hosting providers over a couple of years, and may have been hosted at `http://marmablue.cjb.net` (probably itself a forwarder), `http://members.dencity.com/marmablue/`, `http://marmablue777.f2s.net`, and `http://members.lycos.co.uk/marmablue7/php/index.php`.

### April 2003

An early Wiki version, my first move from static HTML pages to some kind of "proper" back-end. It was contributed to by a few friends. This is the first archive after the site received its own domain, `marmablue.co.uk`. Having a proper domain seems to increase the chances of the Internet Archive capturing its content, so there is more recorded from this point onwards.

### June 2003

A slightly nicer-looking version.

### January 2004

A [blog entry from this month](/blog/papapapayeah/) refers to the launch of "MMWP 9th Style", which presumably means I was onto the 9th redesign of the site at this point. Several of them must presumably be lost.


### May 2004

I [abandoned the Wiki](/blog/its-official/) around the end of January 2004, apparently because I was the only contributor and I intended friends to contribute more than they did. With my blog on LiveJournal, I made my homepage into a simple index page, and split off a number of smaller sub-sites. Unfortunately the "chat" box on the left hand side was largely filled with spam.

### June 2004

The chat box was quickly dropped, replaced inexplicably with direct links to stuff running on my home PC&mdash;all apparently offline.

### August 2004

My blog was hosted on LiveJournal at this point, and looked something like this for the whole time I used it, from [my first post in 2003](/blog/let-the-blogging-begin/) to [the point I quit in 2011](/blog/the-rise-and-fall-of-livejournal/).

### March 2005

Back to hosting real content on the Mad Marmablue Web Portal site, now centred around fiction and stories. This used a custom back-end written in PHP that I remember being very proud of at the time.

### July 2010

The site migrated via Drupal to WordPress between 2006 and 2009, and I can't find a lot of screenshots from this progression. The site was renamed from "The Mad Marmablue Web Portal" to "Only Dreaming", and was moved to `onlydreaming.net`. My blog moved over from LiveJournal in around 2009. Here's one of the still largely fiction-oriented WordPress themes.

### October 2011

And a cleaner, sans-serif version. Use of CSS-minifying plugins has prevented the Internet Archive from capturing the stylesheets for a number of intermediate themes.

### July 2013

From around 2013 I moved from WordPress to Octopress 2 and dropped the "Only Dreaming" name in favour of simply `ianrenton.com`. This version is a plain HTML page that largely links to Octopress sites on a number of subdomains. Social network links and links to other sites I made are prominent.

### September 2013

The Octopress 2 version of the blog, which was separate from other sections such as hardware/robots and software.

### September 2014

A prettier but much more image-heavy version of the homepage. Pictures for each link are monochrome until mouse-over when the CSS effect is removed and full colour is displayed.

### November 2014

A small iteration on the Octopress 2 blog.

### August 2015

Everything back under one subdomain, now on Octopress 3 which makes this more easily possible.

### September 2015

A short-lived "typewriter-style" version which I liked visually, but proved hard to read.

![](/blog/sitehistory/2015-09-24.png){: .center}



### December 2015

Possibly going a little too far to distinguish the menus.

![](/blog/sitehistory/2015-12-22.png){: .center}



### January 2016

Back to a more stock-Jekyll theme, still serif and focussed on text.
