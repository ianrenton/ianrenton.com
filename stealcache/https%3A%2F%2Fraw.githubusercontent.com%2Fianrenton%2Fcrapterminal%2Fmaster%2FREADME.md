It's like HyperTerminal, but not shitty and annoying!

This is a Java app, written for JRE version 6.  It requires [RxTx](http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), a free serial comms library for Java on Windows, Linux, Mac & Solaris.  RxTx is not packaged with this application - you can grab the latest binaries [here](http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download).  (The zip contains an INSTALL file which explains where to put everything on each platform.  You must do this before running CrapTerminal.) 

### Changelog

  * **3 (1 Oct 2010):** Backported a bunch of changes from Iridium9601Sim.  Ported it to use RXTX not JavaComm.


  * **2 (26 Feb 2009):** Fixed the printing-one-character-every-two bug, Added ability to send.


  * **1 (21 Aug 2008):** Initial release.
