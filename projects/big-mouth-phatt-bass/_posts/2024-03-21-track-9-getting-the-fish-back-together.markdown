Plug-in breadboards are convenient for prototyping, but there's no chance that this mess is ever going to fit back inside the Billy Bass enclosure:

As a temporary measure, I decided to extend the JST connectorised cables out of the rear of the enclosure, then mount the breadboard between the legs of the stand.

I had a couple of JST XH cable extenders handy from previous projects, where they were used for extending the balance port of LiPo batteries. I ordered a couple more to make up the set&mdash;overall, we need two 2-wire cables, one 4-wire and one 6-wire. I drilled a hole in the rear of the fish, since the cables wouldn't quite fit comfortably through the existing wall-mounting holes, then passed the cables through.

These cables could then be connected up inside:

The fish could then be reassembled as it originally was.

The breadboard is then a "convenient" fit between the legs of the stand:

"Convenient" is in quotes there because this arrangement does make it difficult to access the switch and impossible to change the batteries. However, when necessary it can be slid sideways and removed from its normal position. It is, however, still quite fragile.
