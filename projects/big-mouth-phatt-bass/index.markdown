title: Big Mouth Phatt Bass
---

Imagine, if you will, the heady early days of the 2000s. The Millennium had come and gone, and things were looking bright. Warp Brothers' hit [*Phatt Bass*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca-r-U5ybx4&pp=ygUYd2FycCBicm90aGVycyBwaGF0dCBiYXNz) was doing the rounds in the clubs, and for an altogether different demographic, [Big Mouth Billy Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mouth_Billy_Bass) was taking the world by storm.

The *bass (fish)/bass (music)* pun writes itself. My friends and I were joking that this should happen back when we were still in school, so I'm not sure why it's taken over 20 years to get to where we are today.

But this *is* where we are today. Please welcome, and accept my sincerest apologies for, *Big Mouth Phatt Bass*:
