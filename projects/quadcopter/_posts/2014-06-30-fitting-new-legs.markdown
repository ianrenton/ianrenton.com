I'm replacing the brittle fibreglass legs (../death claws) of the quadcopter with a cheap plastic tube frame, which hopefully should be a bit more resilient against my poor flying skills.

Firstly the old legs were removed:

The new legs attach to the central plate, so this was removed for easier access:

These are the strange clips the new legs use. They have a captive nut and bolt on one side, and a screw thread through the other:

They screw down to the central plate:

Plastic support rods push through the clips:

The rest of the frame clips onto them. It's bigger than I expected...

Reattaching all the bits I took off temporarily:

New (dodgy) battery attachment straps. Need to improve on this:
