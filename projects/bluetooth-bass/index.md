This project takes my original ["Big Mouth Phatt Bass"](/projects/big-mouth-phatt-bass) in a slightly different direction. A new custom PCB swaps the MP3 player for an audio amplifier, and the code has then been rewritten to take advantage of the ESP32 chip's Bluetooth capability. The modification turns the Billy Bass into a Bluetooth audio receiver that moves its head and mouth when audio is played. Making it, of course, the ideal driving companion[^1].
