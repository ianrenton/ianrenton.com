"Plane/Sailing Portable" is a tiny hardware stack designed to be installed in ad-hoc locations, fitted to a vehicle or even carried in a pocket, from where it can contribute ADS-B, AIS or APRS coverage to the [Plane/Sailing](https://ianrenton.com/projects/planesailing/) tracking system.

The build guide is split into sections on the following pages. 

The project is still at the prototype stage (cable ties are still involved!)&mdash;see the final page for potential future improvements to be made.
