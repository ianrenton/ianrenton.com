  <p>I absolutely love your project. It's the coolest use I've yet seen for a
  Raspberry Pi.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I've got to admit though that that I had
  noticed you hadn't posted any warning note next to a code snipped which
  basically goes:</p><p></p><p></p><p>1) Deactivate your security<br>2) Order
  your computer to download and compile a set of unvetted code from the
  internet.<br>4) Run it as root.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I think npm has a really
  important 1 line warning next to its simillar script: <a
  href="http://npmjs.org/" rel="nofollow
  noopener">http://npmjs.org/</a></p><p></p><p></p><p>I'm only a little nervous
  about it because the raspberry pi is supposed to be a kids platform, and I
  think it would be really cool if the community made an effort to make sure all
  the awesome project documentation teaches young coders good habits.</p>
