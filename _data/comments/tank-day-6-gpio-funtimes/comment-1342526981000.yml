  <p>I did wonder if I'd have to, but I tried to avoid it as I'd never done any
  kernel module development before.  As it turned out, usleep() in C is good
  enough to produce the timing I need -- in fact, the timing is more reliable
  using this method than it was using the original RF receiver
  board!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Thanks for the link though, I'll keep it in mind if
  I need to do any higher frequency control.</p>
