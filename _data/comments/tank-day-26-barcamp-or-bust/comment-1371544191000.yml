  <p>I haven't given up, I just have an acute shortage of free time! I used to
  work on the tank during my lunch hour, as it's not really practical for me to
  do it on evenings/weekends, but it's been about six months since I last had a
  lunch hour that I didn't have to work through :)</p><p></p><p></p><p>I have a
  number of plans in the short term, such as moving the pages served by lighttpd
  onto the mongoose server, which would get around the current cross-site
  Javascript problem on the web interface; improving the autonomous mode's
  behaviour; and upgrading the battery.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Longer term, I still
  hope to replace the RX-18 board with an Arduino and motor shields at some
  point, to allow fine-grained control of motor speeds.</p>
