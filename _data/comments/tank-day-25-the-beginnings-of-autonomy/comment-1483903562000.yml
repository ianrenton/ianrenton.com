  <p>PiBoy, all the code is in my github repository

  rel="nofollow noopener">Web interface</a></li><br></ul></p><p></p><p>You
  should be able to get up and running by following roughly what I've done, you
  don't necessarily need to learn C, unless something's different in your setup
  and my code doesn't work for you. Let me know if you have any problems getting
  it working!</p>
