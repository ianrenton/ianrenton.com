  <p>Hi Andreas, your project looks great! You may not have the gun turret on
  yours, but it looks like your autonomous navigation is working a bit better
  than mine.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Out of interest, how quickly do your ultrasound
  sensors respond? Mine seems to take around 200ms to return a reading, (and
  that reading is quite often wrong) which is why it tends to drive into things
  a lot!</p><p></p><p></p><p>I have modified the timings of various things in my
  code to produce a better autonomous behaviour than what you can see in the
  video above, and I will post a new video soon.</p>
