  <p>Hi Ian, thanks for the flowers. I have a separate thread for the
  measurement. It supplies at a frequency of about 10Hz (one arduino-sketch for
  compass and two ultrasonics). I push in a kind of register and I have an
  algorithm that smoothes(?) the measured values ??by average.<br>Next step will
  be a kind of sensor-radar.</p>
