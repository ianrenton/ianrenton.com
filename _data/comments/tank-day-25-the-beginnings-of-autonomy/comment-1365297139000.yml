  <p>Hi Ian, I don't see my first post , maybe the tinterweb Golins ate it .. so
  I'll repost .. if it's a duplicate feel free to delete.. btw since that post
  we are sitting around listens to some DPurple and discussing how your blog
  will affect our lives over the next few months .. all positive so far except
  one of the guys is married so he will have to hide the excitement from
  her.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I have to say first of all Ian thank you very much
  for sharing this build, I'm gob smacked at how well it's been constructed and
  the effort you have put into it. I have always wanted to have a pc / tablet
  controlled RC tank .. I have the Patton which is now in bits on my work bench
  ready to mod. My three other friends who have 7 tanks between them all went to
  CPC today and bought PI's lol. We are just waiting for the Voltage regulators
  and some bits from RS that I ordered tonight. I only stumbled across the
  article last night it's exactly what I've been looking for for over a year. I
  noticed on the tanks controller that there are two spare sockets, I had this
  idea of adding  a servo so that the camera can pan independently. Do you think
  that that would be possible? Also a mad idea we had was to turn the firing
  system into either laser or some other ammunition and maybe even run an RC
  version of world of tanks. Anyway that's a long way in the future. So once
  again thank you very much for all the effort you put in on this blog and the
  tank build you are a god!  :) I'm 47 and giddy about building a PITank ..</p>
