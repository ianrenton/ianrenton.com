  <p>Hi Ian , one of my friends has a Hornet On Screen Display or OSD but this
  is more for  flight but it looks awesome .. a vid of it working <a
  href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B14epS918VM" rel="nofollow
  noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B14epS918VM</a> not his video btw. It
  even shows battery life etc GPS data and some of the stuff you have diplsyed
  tilt etc. Its way to expensive but the idea is there. Anyway small steps. I
  have a box full of arduino sensor / motor shields so I will look into that .
  Plus a Sony micro camera , the battle tank IR is a great idea like you said
  maybe improved with some code and the Pi ..?</p>
