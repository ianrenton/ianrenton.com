  <p>Hi Ian , are you or will you overlay the sensor data on the video image ,
  only I think it would be awesome, also just a thought could you tie in the
  range with the gun elevation ? i.e if the object it 10 feet away the gun
  elevates for the range ? Juat a thought .. good work as ever mate .. cant wait
  to get my bits and start on this project !</p>
