  <p>No problem, I'm glad there are people out there as enthusiastic about this
  stuff as we are :)</p><p></p><p></p><p>To answer your questions one by
  one:</p><p></p><p><ul><br><li>Overlaying sensor data on the video image could
  certainly be done. The easiest thing to do would be to do it on the client web
  browser, just using HTML+CSS to format and locate the sensor data over the
  video. That's probably not what you meant though! It would be nice to actually
  insert the data into the video stream, for example so that the data is visible
  when the video is saved to disk. There's almost certainly a program that can
  do that, but I haven't looked for one yet.</li><br><li>Elevating the gun based
  on range is potentially possible, but there is a problem with the tank's
  elevation control in that there isn't a separate signal for Up and Down.
  There's just a "change elevation" signal that uses a gearing system to make
  the elevation follow a sort of "sine wave" pattern. The upshot of this is that
  the tank doesn't have a deterministic way of setting a specific
  elevation.</li><br><li>You can certainly add a pan/tilt arrangement to the
  camera, though I'm not sure what the best place to drive it from would be. The
  two ports on the RX-18 that don't (normally) have anything plugged in have
  specific purposes relating to the "infra-red battle system" that you can buy
  for these tanks (<a

  rel="nofollow noopener">see schematic</a>), so I don't believe the outputs on
  their pins can be controlled independently via remote control or RPi. Most
  simple pan/tilt brackets use quite basic servomotors, which you can't drive
  directly from the RPi, but you could use something like an <a

  noopener">I2C servo controller</a> or make your RPi support <a

  noopener">Arduino motor shields</a> using a <a
  href="http://www.cooking-hacks.com/index.php/documentation/tutorials/raspberry-pi-to-arduino-shields-connection-bridge"
  rel="nofollow noopener">connection bridge</a>.</li><br><li>As I mentioned
  earlier an IR "battle system" exists for these tanks, so you could add that
  fairly easily. I don't believe that normally gives feedback to the remote
  control, but I believe the "I'm hit" signal comes back from the "battle
  system" controller to the RX-18 via port CN2 pin D, so you could tap off that
  and monitor it via the RPi's GPIO. Or you could build an equivalent system
  yourself, of course :)  On the subject of "other ammunition", it may not be
  quite what you had in mind but at some point I'd love to add one of those
  "office" USB missile launchers to the back of the tank!</li><br></ul></p>
