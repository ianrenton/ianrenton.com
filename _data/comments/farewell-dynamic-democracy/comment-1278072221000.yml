  <p>Being a political geek, I suppose it's true that I'm not a good
  representative of the man-on-the-street.  But we're largely a vocal breed,
  particularly online, and we make our opinions known much more readily than the
  public at large.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Of course, the government would have to
  be wary of taking opinions on <em>Your Freedom</em> as representative of the
  country as a whole, but before we start thinking about that, I think we need
  to see if they take any notice of what's posted at
  all!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Case in point, I suspect the Digital Economy Act is
  going to be Issue #1 on <em>Your Freedom</em>, and that's a bill that the
  government have suggested they have no intention to repeal.  If the D.E. Act
  doesn't disappear, I don't hold out much hope for the rest of the
  site.</p><p></p><p></p><p>(Whoa, re-reading that, I didn't mean to be quite
  that negative!  I apologise on behalf of my inner cynic.  :P)</p>
