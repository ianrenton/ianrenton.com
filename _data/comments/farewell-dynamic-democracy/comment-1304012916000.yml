  <p>This is probably the core issue facing new social networks and other new
  sites that depend for their functionality on having a reasonable number of
  users.  And, as you can probably tell by the fact that Dynamic Democracy
  folded after a few months with only a few dozen users, that side of things
  isn't exactly one of my strengths!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Whether users' efforts
  make a difference may be almost secondary to the general problem, "users will
  play if many others are playing".  To get the initial rush of users that kicks
  it all off probably involves some marketing voodoo that is beyond my
  understanding :)</p><p></p><p></p><p>As a suggestion, based on DD's failures,
  maybe try to introduce a level of interaction somewhere between voting and
  bill-posting?  With DD, bill-posting was a hook that got people coming back to
  the site -- but it was a level of initial investment that most weren't willing
  to put in. Voting was at a low enough level that everyone did it, but it
  provided no hook to return to the site later.</p>
