  <p>I think the core mechanics of the site (Digg/Reddit-style voting on
  'bills') were fairly good, but obviously it failed, so there's a lot of things
  I'd do differently.</p><p></p><p></p><p>First off, no anonymous commenting
  next time.  I thought it was a good idea to remove any possible barrier to
  entry, but I spent far too much time trying to fight spam (unsuccessfully, in
  the end).  I should have forced some kind of authentication, but minimised the
  barrier to entry by including easier and more obvious ways to log in using
  Facebook Connect, Twitter etc.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As far as the software
  goes, the last few years has seen a real growth in software to generate this
  kind of site.  Drigg on top of Drupal was functional but a bit rough around
  the edges - nowadays there are dedicated packages for this kind of site
  (largely Digg/Reddit/Stack Overflow clones, but still).  One of those might
  have reduced some of the awkwardness factors involved with trying to turn a
  CMS into a rating site.</p><p></p><p></p><p>On the subject of Stack Overflow,
  a better-implemented Karma system with more obvious and more desirable rewards
  would have been good.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Lastly, exposure is everything. 
  Because creating on DD is relatively hard (it's easy to rate and comment, but
  comparatively difficult to write a well-thought-out bill), a site like this
  needs a lot of attention in order to have a reasonable base of content. 
  Probably less than 1% of visitors will create a bill (certainly the case with
  DD), so to have 100 bills, you might need over 10000 visitors.  DD never got
  much exposure, mostly because I don't really know how to do that sort of
  thing.  The lesson there for "next time" might be that programmers are all
  well and good, but you need someone who's good at PR to spread the word.</p>
