  <p>A bit of both, I think.  The marketing campaign -- actually getting the
  word out in the first place -- is important, but I think the most important
  thing of all is for users to know that they stand a chance of making a
  difference.</p><p></p><p></p><p>With hindsight our government's "Your Freedom"
  site was also a failure, as to some extent was the No. 10 Petitions site that
  preceded it, even though the government <em>was</em> on the other end,
  listening to what people said.  The problem was that few people believed that
  Government Listening = Government Acting.  Getting past the initial barrier of
  cynicism might be the most difficult job of all.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The No.
  10 Petitions site had a time limit for each petition, and if a petition had
  gathered enough signatories at that time, it received an official response
  from the PM's office.  The reason it was disheartening to use the site was
  that often this response was along the lines of "Thanks for your input, you
  make a good point, but this is why you're wrong".  To keep people engaged in
  an official version of a site like DD, I think the government would have to
  keep their own opinions out of it as far as possible -- but that's very much
  at odds with the way politics is conducted today in both our
  countries.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Rambling diversion over! :)  When I say "a bit
  of both", what I mean is that there are many types of potential user -- 99%
  will be apathetic, and all they will ever do is vote up / digg / 'like' a page
  that says something they agree with.  I think a designer of a site like this
  needs to really cultivate the other 1% that are prepared to put the time in
  provided they're sure their effort will be useful (they do exist, look at
  Wikipedia!), while acknowledging that by and large, the other 99% are a lost
  cause. Turning the 1% into 2% could be a massive effort compared to making the
  site really good for the 1%.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Of course, then you run into
  the problem that if the site becomes important in policy-making, your policies
  are being decided by 1% of the population that care, and the other 99% who
  just vote up suggestions that you legalise marijuana.</p>
