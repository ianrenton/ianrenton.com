  <p>Hi Ian,</p><p></p><p></p><p>I am still wondering about the potential of
  this concept.  Here in the United States, there is great frustration with our
  current system.  Most people feel disenfranchised and that voting in regular
  bi-annual elections are not worth their time.  If there was a way for citizens
  to discuss issues and vote on solutions how many would really join?  You have
  said in England that not many proved to want to.  With the right marketing
  campaign and with the right incentive program for users do you think something
  like this could take off?  Or is it that, even with a perfectly created and
  marketed site, people in general are just to busy, uninterested or apathetic
  to really make something like this work.  Are we doomed to business as
  usual?</p>
