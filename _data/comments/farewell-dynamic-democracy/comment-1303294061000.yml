  <p>Hi Ian,<br>I was very sad to find your site only after it ceased
  functioning as I certainly would have posted a bill!  I agree entirely with
  your last comment that exposure is everything.  I'm interested in your project
  as I'm working on something similar - how did you guard against people voting
  numerous times for their own bill?</p>
