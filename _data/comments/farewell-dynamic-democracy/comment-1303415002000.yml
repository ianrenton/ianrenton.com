  <p>If we want to make a difference in this world we need to make sites like
  these accessible to more than 1% of the population.  If 1% is defining the
  issues and creating solutions how to you get many more people to vote?  We are
  thinking that if we make our site a vehicle in which large national groups can
  promote their ideas, then they will use their networking power to attract
  their members to our site.  Why would they do this?  Because most national
  groups have maxed out the number of members they can attract as they are
  preaching to the choir.  We think a neutral, non-partisan, non government,
  site that creates a level playing field where all ideas compete against each
  other, might be an attractive way for these organizations to spread their
  ideas to a wider audience.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Furthermore, we would let
  citizens organize themselves into groups (neighborhood, issue, profession,
  etc.) and use their social media connections to spread their
  ideas.</p><p></p><p></p><p>We would maintain one-citizen-one-vote so grass
  roots organizations would have an advantage over astro-turf
  groups.</p><p></p><p></p><p>We have been thinking about a site like this for 6
  months and are still debating the viability of the idea based on the shaky
  premise of a circular logic argument:  People will play if:  Many others are
  playing and there is the perception that their efforts are making a
  difference: Their efforts will make a difference if people play in great
  enough numbers so that policy makers cannot ignore
  them.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This is where we are stuck.  If you make the
  assumption that people are frustrated with our current system and would be
  willing to participate in a more inclusive on line system then how do you get
  the first million to do so?</p>
