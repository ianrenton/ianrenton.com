  <p>Thanks for going to the trouble of explaining the circuit better -- and for
  finding the part numbers (I had all the components lying around, so I never
  had to look them up!)</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins have no
  protection at all, so if you try to draw or push more than 16mA per pin (50mA
  for the 3v3 power pin) you stand a reasonable chance of toasting your
  Pi.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Regarding power dissipation in the 310R resistor,
  since the full voltage is across this resistor when we are trying to send a
  "low" signal to the RX-18, this is probably the case slightly more than 50% of
  the time. I used a 1/4W resistor and have had no problems -- I haven't noticed
  it being particularly warm.</p>
