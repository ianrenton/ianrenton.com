  <p>Thanks!</p><p></p><p></p><p>The resistor values in this circuit don't have
  to be exactly the same as mine - anything roughly similar will do. The
  potential divider created by the 310R and 390R resistors ensures that when the
  transistor is off, the output is roughly 4V, but this 4V is fed into the RX-18
  which isn't particularly picky about its input levels. In fact, even with my
  resistors, the output is rarely exactly 4V as VCC varies between 6 and 8 volts
  depending on how full the battery is.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So long as you get a
  resistor close to 310 Ohms -- 330 will be absolutely fine -- you shouldn't run
  into any problems.</p>
