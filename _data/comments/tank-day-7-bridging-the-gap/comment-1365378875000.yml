  <p>If anyone needs the part numbers for the above boards ( because I didnt
  have a clue) I posted on the CNC forum I use to help me find them .. hope I
  dont step on anyone toes Ian only I'm no electronics expert and there may be
  more like me :) <a href="http://mycnc.co.uk" rel="nofollow

  amount of current from the GPIO pin through the transistor. Without a resistor
  the GPIO pin would see an almost short to gnd, leading to the Pi getting
  toasted (should have a certain degree of protection I would think) or the
  transistor gettign cooked (due to the limited amount of current, I;d expect
  the Pi to die first). Anything in the 1k-10k range should work
  fine.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The other 2 resistors are being used as a voltage
  divider to reduce the 7.2V to aprox 4V. One thing to note is the 310R will
  basically be connected direct to ground when the transistor is switched on, so
  you want to ensure it's got a high enough power rating.<br>So current is
  7.2V/310R = 23mA, then Power is 7.2V*0.023A=0.16W. An 1/8W resistor is only
  0.125W, so you may want a 1/4W resistor for durability, or two 1/8w in series
  or parallel, if you can't guarantee long periods of being the transistor being
  switched on.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Just done a quick search, and 1/4W are
  actually cheaper. I've been doing too much with SMD lately where 1/8W is
  normal!</p><p></p><p></p><p>10k - RS own brand 1/4W- 707-7745 12p for
  10<br>390R -RS 1/4W - 707-7634 16p for 10<br>309R (nearest to 310R) - either
  Vishay 3/5 (0.6)W - 683-3500 -1.25 for 25 OR TE 1/4W - 754-9072 1.07 for
  5<br>The TE have a tighter tolerance (0.1% v 1%)</p>
