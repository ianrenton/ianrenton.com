  <p>Hi Ian,<br>I'm attempting to follow your build and just getting started.
  I'm having trouble finding a 310 ohm resistor.  I can get the 390 ohm, no
  problem - but the 310 ohm doesn't seem to be readily available.  Closest I can
  find at the local Radio Shack is a 330 ohm.   Where did you get
  yours?<br>Thanks Ian - your raspberry tank build is so cool!<br>Brad - Salt
