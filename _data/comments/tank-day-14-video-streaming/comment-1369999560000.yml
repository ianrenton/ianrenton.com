  <p>Hello,</p><p></p><p></p><p>I would like to know if you have any lag in the
  video streaming? I have a similar project underway with a Tiger RC tank, but
  with Arduino for controlling the tank, and a Raspberry Pi for video streaming.
  With motion I have about 1 second of lag between the camera and the viewing
  computer. This make drinving a bit complicated :)</p><p></p><p></p><p>Best
