  <p>Marek: Do you definitely have a Logitech C200?  Mine uses the
  <code>uvcvideo</code> driver, which doesn't appear in your <code>lsmod</code>
  output.  Try running <code>sudo modprobe uvcvideo</code>, then (with your cam
  connected) see if <code>uvcvideo</code> then appears in your
  <code>lsmod</code> output.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It would also help if you could
  run <code>mjpg_streamer</code> manually from the command-line and post the
  output it produces, this should make it easier to diagnose the problem.</p>
