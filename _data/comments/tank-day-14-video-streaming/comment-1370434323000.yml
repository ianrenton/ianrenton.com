  <p>There is some lag in the video - I haven't done any accurate testing but it
  feels like about half a second. It's alright if you drive slowly and
  cautiously, but that's about it. If you're after faster streaming, you may be
  able to achieve that using something like VLC talking straight to
  mjpg-streamer, rather than using a web page.</p>
