  <p>That's up to whatever network your Raspberry Pi is on.  If you want it to
  be accessible from the internet, and the local network it's on includes an
  internet-connected router, you'll want to open a port on the router and point
  it at the Raspberry Pi.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For example, if your RPi had IP
  192.168.0.100, and your mjpg-streamer web interface was running on port 5000,
  you could set up a port forwarding rule in your router to do something
  like:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Incoming, port 80 --->
  192.168.0.100:5000</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you then find your router's public
  IP address (e.g. using <a href="http://whatismyip.com/" rel="nofollow
  noopener">http://whatismyip.com</a>), someone else on the internet could type
  your IP address into their web browser and they would see the mjpg-streamer
  web interface.</p>
