  <p>Well I was able to get it going last night but had to switch to Motion and
  use a different Webcam.  I had a MS HD-5000, MS HD-5001, Logitect Desktop Pro
  (laptop model), and an old Logitect Pro something-or-other camera to work
  with.  I had to switch out the USB hub for a different one.  Some of the ports
  seemed to not work on the older one.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the end the new
  usb hub and the MS HD-5001 camera worked clean and clear with no errors, not
  even a single one.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Tuning Motion is the next step to
  improve the quality of the video capture.  Currently using 640x480 @ 5FPS. 
  Still seems sluggish considering I am running the Pi v2 model and running Arch
  without a mouse, keyboard, or monitor.  The network is hardwired and the Pi
  configured to use a static address.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Audio capture has not
  yet been tried.  Not sure if I have the guts to try to include that in this
  project.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So I guess the next step is to try and find a
  CPU/Memory monitor that can run from within terminal.  I intend to use a
  second Putty session for this.  I want to see how high I can set Motion's
  frame rate before hitting the devices performance ceiling.  I need the ability
  to monitor both sessions and tweek as things progress.  I briefly installed
  Conky but it seems to be focused on using a desktop to display the results,
  which I will not be using in this project.  Have not tried TOP
  yet.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Suggestions? ( w/configuration settings and command
  to start it please :) )</p><p></p><p></p><p>Thanks again!</p>
