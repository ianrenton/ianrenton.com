  <p>Is anyone able to explain why I only get a fairly smooth stream, if I
  select the supported max resolution (MPEG, 1280x720)? Any other supported
  resolution (except below 320x240) works bad (first picture after 20-30s,
  ~0,1fps).<br>With the highest resolution, my connection (WLAN/internet/mobile)
  is the bottleneck. So I would like to get a slightly lower resolution working
  like 800x600.</p>
