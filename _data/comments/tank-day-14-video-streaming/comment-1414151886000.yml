  <p>Late 2014 update for all your streaming needs. Linux projects has made a
  pretty stable, but still work in progress MMAL interfaced UV4L driver, which
  can stream raw h264 or MJPEG. <a

  have tested this and can conclude that there is still the 500ms lag but I can
  stream 800x600 @ 9-12FPS which has a really sharp "video" This lag seems to
  decrease slightly at 640x480 and you can get up to 20fps. It works on iPhone
  safari, Android and almost everything else.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,
  because the h264 stream is raw, you cannot embed it for HTML5 complaint
  browsers, yet (it will be possible soon). But using VLC and the --dumux h264
  option, we can now watch 1080p at 25-30FPS! There is still that annoying
  500-1000ms lag.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I wonder what is causing this lag though.
  I managed to get 200ms using nginx-rtmp  and standard raspciam, piping data -
  but viewing the video was a nightmare on mobiles and most PCs
  anyway.</p><p></p><p></p><p>All my testing done on
  LAN.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Very interesting project and comments here :)</p>
