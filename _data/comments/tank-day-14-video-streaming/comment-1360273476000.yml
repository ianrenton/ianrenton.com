  <p>Trying your setup without the X server (the bit that provides a graphical
  environment) is definitely a good idea. I've never really used a graphical
  environment on my RPi so I don't know how much of a hit on the system
  resources it is, but it's probably significant. If you can turn that off - not
  just a matter of unplugging the monitor but making sure the software itself
  isn't running - your video processing will probably run faster. If your
  graphical environment runs automatically on startup, experienced Arch users
  should be able to advise on the best way to disable it. (The distro I use
  starts up in a terminal, and you have to run X
  manually.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>Conky uses a reasonable amount of processing
  power itself if you're running it with settings such as a transparent
  background and 1 sec refresh interval. Using top is very easy - you just run
  it from the console and it starts showing you the top 20-or-so processes
  ordered by CPU usage, which is probably what you want. From within top, hit q
  to quit and ? for help if you need to sort by something other than CPU
  load.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you wanted to avoid two PuTTY sessions you could
  use a terminal multiplexer such as screen or tmux - but there's not really
  anything wrong with running two PuTTY windows at the same time.</p>
