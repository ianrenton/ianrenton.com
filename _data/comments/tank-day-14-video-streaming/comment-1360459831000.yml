  <p>Sorry for the confusion.  Let me try to explain again.  Of the top two CPU
  processes Motion was spiking as high as 90+% but averaged about 40% cpu load. 
  The next highest cpu user was TOP at about 1.5% cpu usage.  I lowered the
  camera resolution to 320x240 and the cpu load for Motion is now idling around
  19%.  The FPS is the same, very slow.  I may try to completely rebuild the
  image.  My early experiments with the other webcam driver may have created
  this issue.</p>
