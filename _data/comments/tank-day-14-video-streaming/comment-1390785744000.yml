  <p>akshay, an init script is not quite the same as a normal <code>bash</code>
  script -- if you want to create one, follow my example above and replace the
  line beginning '<code>/home/</code>...' with yours. (Yours currently runs
  <code>cd</code> with a relative path, so you will need to modify your line
  slightly to make that an absolute path e.g.
  <code>/home/<youruser>/mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer</code>.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>init
  scripts don't need a file extension, they are files with any name you like
  that live in <code>/etc/init.d</code> â€” for example, mine is
  <code>/etc/init.d/webcam</code>. So long as it's in the right place, the
  <code>update-rc.d</code> script will find it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Note that
  this is for Debian and Debian-derived distros such as Ubuntu, Raspbian etc. If
  you use a different distro it may have a different way of writing init
  scripts.</p>
