  <p>yeah, there was my fault, i use logitech e2500, it looks almost like c200
  so that's why i mistaken it. Anyway, i got it running with mplayer
  (mjpg-streamer, streamer from xawtv , and few other tools failed) using this
  line :</p><p></p><p></p><p>mplayer tv:// -tv driver=v4l2
  device=/dev/video1</p><p></p><p></p><p>It shows many many "artifacts" when
  displaying a stream, but generally it works,<br>anyway, thanks for Your reply
  and good luck with Your projects.</p>
