  <p>No, nothing over 1.5% CPU usage, with Motion taking an average of 45% with
  spikes upward of 96% at times.  Nothing else is running besides TOP and it was
  the 1.5% CPU consumer.  Memory consumption was negligible across the board. 
  As mentioned in my previous post, I suspect there is a bandwidth limitation on
  the USB bus that is hampering the throughput significantly.  Not sure if
  different cameras will make a difference if the limitation is on the RPi.</p>
