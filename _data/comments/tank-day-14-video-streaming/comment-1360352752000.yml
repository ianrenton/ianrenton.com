  <p>I was able to get top working easier then expected.  It came preinstalled
  so it was simple to start and provided me what I needed.  I still have very,
  very slow FPS and no noticible improvements when adjusting the motion.conf
  settings.  I am getting about a 5 sec delay between actual movement and output
  in VNC.  That seems just too slow to be of practicle use.  I have the v2 Pi
  model and have overclocked it to 900mhz.  No effect at all on the FPS.  Must
  be a physical limitation at the USB level is my guess.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Is
  the setup good enough for the original intention?  Yes, this is good enough
  for my sons project.  More to learn and that's really what the Pi is all
  about... learning.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Thanks for letting me bounce this
  project off of you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>DC</p>
