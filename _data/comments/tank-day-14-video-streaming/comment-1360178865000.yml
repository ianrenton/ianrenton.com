  <p>I hope this thread is still being monitored.  I am new to Linux and the
  Raspberry Pi.  I bit off a bit more then I can chew and agreed to do a project
  with my son for a special school science event.  The initial instructions from
  Jeremy's Blog seem straight forward so I "assumed" I could simply follow the
  steps and make it work too.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Nope, not
  quite.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I have the latest Arm image (and v2 of the Pi) and
  its been updated.  Tried jjstream and can get the Pi to run it, I see its
  grabbing and outputting from the camera from my Putty session.  However, I
  can't get either the browser or VLC to show the stream.  Very frustrating to
  say the least.</p><p></p><p></p><p>One of the most frustrating steps in this
  process was trying to find the proper command to start jjstreamer.  Jeremy
  seemed to skip that step :(</p><p></p><p></p><p>I just found this blog
  discussion and am willing to give it a whorl.  Only have a week and a half to
  get this working and the presentation put together, but also have a federal
  audit going on at work smack dab in the middle of it all. 
  grrrr.....</p><p></p><p></p><p>Any advice would be much appreciated.  Be
  kind....</p>
