  Google+ is probably a worthy successor to Buzz, but it suffers from the same
  problem as Diaspora -- no "critical mass" of active users to make it worth
  committing to, and no API that would allow users to use it from
  multi-social-network clients for minimal effort.  Of course, IRC and mailing
  lists suffer from this problem too as means to communicate between
  friends.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Out of interest, since you don't use Twitter,
  Facebook or IRC and don't post on LJ an awful lot, what <em>do</em> you use to
  keep in touch with friends online?  "I do all that in real life you sad
  bastard" is a perfectly valid response here :)</p>
