  <p>This quacks like polemic, so rather than climb old Cantankerous and start
  addressing points individually, I shall say this:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Join
  rstatus, <a href="http://app.net" rel="nofollow noopener">app.net</a>,
  Dreamwidth or start an email list and I shall be right behind thee. Diaspora
  was poo, and I can start emacs idling in #thisone all day again if you'd like,
  though ... er... I'd rather not. :)</p><p></p><p></p><p>But I rather fear that
  most of the problem isn't the medium. It's that life leaves (and often
  requires) less time or effort for writing.</p>
