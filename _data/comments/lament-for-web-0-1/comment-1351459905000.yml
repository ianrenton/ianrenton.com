  <p>for what it's worth, I never left Livejournal or got involved in facebook
  or twitter. I was desperately hoping that diaspora was actually going to be
  usable and really really liked google buzz.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I wish I still
  had time for IRC, but somehow I doubt that part of my life is going to happen
  again. On the other hand, a lot of people I know still use it as their primary
  means of networking, and I do currently have active channels that I could be
  idling on. So it's not like it's gone away, it's just that everyone seems to
  have migrated to a shittier service.</p>
