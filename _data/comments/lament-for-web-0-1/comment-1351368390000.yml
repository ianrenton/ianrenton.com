  <p>"Polemic" is just the polite way to say "trolling", right?
  :)</p><p></p><p></p><p>My problem with joining rstatus / <a
  href="http://app.net" rel="nofollow noopener">app.net</a> or starting a
  mailing list is that most of the time I'd like to talk to more than one friend
  -- I think you might be the only one making the jump with me!  I idle in
  #thisone with Alex, but I don't say things on IRC as much as I would like to
  because unless I discover something that's specific to his interests, I feel
  like more of my friends would enjoy it if I tweeted
  instead.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If a good half dozen of us decided that the Soton
  Kiddies Mailing List was the way forward, I'd set it up in a heartbeat.  But
  you're right, often life leaves us with barely enough time for 140 thumb-typed
  characters, let alone a meaningful e-mail.</p>
