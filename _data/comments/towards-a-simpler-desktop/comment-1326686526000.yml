  <p>I guarantee people won't get what all those icons mean. That's the biggest

  what the icons are trying to suggest.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What is the + sign?
  What is the blob with the (1)? etc etc. I can guess, and I'm not afraid to
  experiment by clicking on things, but for the majority of users not familiar
  with icons (and I'd warrant even some who are) they wouldn't understand and
  would be paralysed by fear of clicking on the wrong
  thing.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I agree with a lot of your points, but the actual
