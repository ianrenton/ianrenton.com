  <p>Mongoose has some pretty sane defaults in that if a request corresponds to
  a file on disk it'll serve it directly - otherwise it'll handle it internally.
  It's ideal for this setup because the web UI 'just works', but you can still
  process dynamic URLs (e.g the tank's movement commands) in the background!</p>
