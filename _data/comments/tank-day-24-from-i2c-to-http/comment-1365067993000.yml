  <p>You're right, if Mongoose supports serving pages from disk for some HTTP
  requests and handling others internally, that's a much nicer way of serving
  the web content. I don't think the tank's web server will really need any of
  lighttpd's more advanced capabilities, so this should be
  fine.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I looked into using WebSockets when I first started
  the web UI for the tank, as I'm much more comfortable working with full-duplex
  TCP/IP sockets and connections than I am with HTTP requests. However, when I
  was first playing with the web UI, the only browser available to me
  (unfortunately!) was IE8 which doesn't have WebSocket support. I decided to do
  without them for browser compatability reasons, but if WebSockets make the
  comms a lot easier then it could be time to revisit that.</p>
