  <p>Can't make that one either I'm afraid -- it's the weekend before our
  wedding (i.e. Intense Panic O'Clock), plus Eric has a work do on the Saturday
  that I'm apparently required at!  It's a shame, because a Freiboden event
  sounds like it could be fun. (Not as Le Marchant, but I'd probably roll a new
  character anyway.)</p>
