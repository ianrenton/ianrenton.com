  <p>I'm definitely a 'settling' person. I'm not sure, though, to what extent
  this is fundamental to my nature, and to what extent it's a by product of
  being shy and introverted.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I struggle to interact with
  strangers. I take a long time to get to know people. Unless I stay in one
  place and get involved in some sort of community, I never get to know anybody
  and so I end up completely without social contact. And then I get lonely and
  depressed.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I think I like to have a sense of 'home'
  anyway, but loneliness is the main reason I couldn't handle an itinerant
  existence.</p>
