  <p>Phoenix Wright! I'd avoid Professor Layton while on holiday; they're
  awesome, but short.You could skip the Phoenix Wright games (which are
  basically GBA ports) and play Apollo Justice or the Edgeworth one, without
  missing much, but the PW trilogy still rules.I've also heard supergood things
  about Infinite Space; Suikoden with rockets, or so I hear. I've yet to play it
  though.</p>
