  <p>Wizards with spont casting can break the game faster than you can say Jack
  Robinson. With prepared casting, it takes them a little bit longer. The thing
  is, for a well played wizard past level 5 or so, the fact that they're
  physically weak is irrelevant because they have enough options to stop it from
  ever being an issue. Most of the rest of the stuff I agree with, but don't
  just let Wizards cast spontaneously. If you want to go that route, ban Wizards
  entirely and only let people play Sorcerers.</p>
