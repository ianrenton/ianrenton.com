  <p>Yes, putting each character in a fixed-width <code><span/></code> or
  <code><div/></code> would definitely fix it, but I was trying to come up with
  a method that didn't rely on defining an HTML element for each character. If
  you were going down that route, it's probably easier to make the whole thing a
  big <code><table/></code>.</p>
