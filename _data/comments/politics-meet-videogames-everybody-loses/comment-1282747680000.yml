  <p>i agree with mostly with what kieran said but while it is still going on
  you have to bare in mind the game is covering the "main conflict" (atlest that
  is my understanding) which is now some time ago rather than the curent
  incirgency aspect. but on the point about a game being reliced while a war is
  going on the have been one or tow in the past which have not caused this fuss
  true thay have all been flops but thats thats develipers issuethis is almost
  cirtenly due to the higtened discution due to Call of Duty with games being
  complained about is infact only working in the games favor becues alot of
  pepal will now whant to see what the fuss was about. I rember whebn i was
  playing CoD MW2 and found the contraveral misson (being wand of it 3 times) i
  was disapointed that was all games have gone alot ferver in the past i point
  at GTA and Saints row. but meny, who where in 2 mindes about it got it to see
  the contravercy its an age old patton seen with all mediasorry for the
  rant</p>
