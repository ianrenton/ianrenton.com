  <p>I think my favorite soundbite from Mr Fox was the incredibly blinkered "At
  the hands of the Taliban, children have lost fathers and wives have lost
  husbands..." Remove the word 'Taliban', and replace it with 'British' - see
  what happens?</p><p></p><p></p><p>I can see why he might be worried, though.
  Anything which puts young members of the public in the position of Afghan
  fighters stands a dangerous chance of increasing empathy and/or tolerance for
  non-British ways of life. Then how're you supposed to persuade said young
  people that to go out and shoot Johnny Foreigner on command is somehow
  noble?</p>
