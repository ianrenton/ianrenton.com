  <p>Politicians collaborating to enforce their ignorance on a public that
  doesn't even think there's a problem is the underlying flaw that reveals
  democracy as just the best of the bunch and not the guiding light of
  civilisation that some seem to be brainwashed into believing.  I expect people
  like this to work on behalf of the people, not just arbitrarily recreate their
  own misguided moral compass, otherwise we're just one step closer to the next
  political cataclysm.Besides which, aren't the British supposed to have the
  least national identity in Europe (possibly the world)?  I can't imagine the
  great sloth that is England actually caring how they are portrayed in foreign
  films and games, I mean, the English accent is virtually international code
  for evil genius right?Thanks Grand Moff Tarkin xx</p>
