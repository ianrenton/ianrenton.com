  <p>I'm gonna be writing about this when I get round to this, but I dissent
  slightly. While Liam Fox is a reactionary idiot, this is in poor taste. If MOH
  was making an artistic point on the war then it'd be fine, but just as an
  action film (ala stallone) set there would be tacky, so would a video game.
  Obviously banning it is wrong, but basing a game on a conflict that is still
  going on isn't a nice move for a major publisher in my eyes.</p>
