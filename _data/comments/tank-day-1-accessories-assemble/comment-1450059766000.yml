  <p>I'm not sure what sizes of tanks Heng Long make, but I'd imagine they all
  use a similar remote control system that can be modified in the same way. A
  1:24 scale tank should still have enough internal space for the Pi and the
  rest of the components, though you might need to go for a smaller battery. Any
  smaller than 1:24 may cause problems fitting everything in.</p>
