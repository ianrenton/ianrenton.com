  <p>Almost all the Heng Long brand ones use the same RX18 control board I
  think, so they should be pretty much the same as mine internally. As for other
  brands, I can't say for sure, but I can't imagine there are any for which it's
  <em>completely</em> impossible to reverse engineer the control protocol and
  fake it from a Pi. Just about any RC tank will do if you're prepared to put
  the hours in figuring out the protocols, or for analogue systems, implementing
  the motor driver with your own hardware.</p>
