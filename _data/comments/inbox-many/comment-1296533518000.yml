  <p>I work like this too. Currently sat on 12 emails in home inbox, and 135 in
  my work inbox. I would say oops, but I know of at least 30 that could be dealt
  with tomorrow if it wasn't for the fact I'm working on a particular project at
  the moment. Pet peeve? Being copied into work emails I have no interest in but
  should probably know about!</p>
