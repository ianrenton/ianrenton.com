  <p>I agree on the "inbox zero" being unproductive point... and since my life
  is made of digital todo lists that OTHER PEOPLE put things on, all of which
  are naturally high-priority (who the hell would ever ask someone to do
  something that was not important?), I am permanently reducing and condensing
  todo lists.  therefore i usually have a scrap of paper near by that holds the
  'current' todo list, and stuff gets crossed of when it is done or no longer
  high priority.  If the list does not fit on the piece of paper, the rest gets
  forgotten until there is space to thing about it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>and if
  after a couple of weeks its not done and no one is chasing me for it, it was
  probably not actually that important in the first place.</p>
