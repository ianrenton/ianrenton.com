message: "Hi Bjarne,\r\n\r\nYes, the `ssh` file is just an empty file. Any contents of the file are ignored. This feature is described in the official documentation here: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#enabling-the-server\r\n\r\nIf you have a monitor and keyboard attached to the Pi you can also turn on SSH the \"normal\" way using the interactive `raspi-config` utility.\r\n\r\nI am using the 2GB RAM variant of the Pi 4. It's plenty for this task, since I am not using a graphical user interface or any desktop software on it.\r\n\r\nPoE HAT sounds like a good addition, let me know how it goes!"
