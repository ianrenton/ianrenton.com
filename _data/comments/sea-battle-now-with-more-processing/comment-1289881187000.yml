  <p>The going-round-in-circles bug is fixed, and will be in today's release.
  (Or tomorrow's if the headache wins tonight.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>Frame rate
  limiting is built in - today's build has it cranked down from 60 to 30.  What
  PC/OS/browser config are you using?  Usage is pretty low on my work laptop
  (C2D 2.8GHz, 3GB, WinXP, IE8).  I've tried it on my temporary home machine
  while my MacBook's in for repair, (1.4GHz, 512MB, Ubuntu 9.10 LiveCD, Chrome
  9) but it's hopeless on that.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Sadly separating game code
  and rendering doesn't actually seem possible in Processing - or at least, it's
  not designed to work that way.  I'm sceptically putting up with it for now,
  but if CPU load is an issue on all platforms, I'll scrap the way it's
  currently working and hack some 'real' Java instead!</p>
