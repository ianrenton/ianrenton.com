  <p>Moderation is a double-edged sword though - it slows down the
  cause-to-effect of people posting.  Not being able to see the results of your
  effort straight away is often a killer of user participation in a new
  site."Your Freedom" is pretty focussed on repealing existing laws, so I'm not
  sure my rant about openness really has a place there at the moment. :(</p>
