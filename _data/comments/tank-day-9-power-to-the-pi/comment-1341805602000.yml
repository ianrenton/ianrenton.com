  <p>I'm trying (in theory - my RPi is still in the mail) to use the same 7.2V
  battery pack for an RC car DC motor and a RPi. Are any components required to
  split the battery between the motor and the converter? Can I just fork the +/-
  wires coming from the battery or do I need diodes or something (sorry, I'm
  quite new to electronics)?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Also, what is your battery's
  capacity and how long does it last?</p>
