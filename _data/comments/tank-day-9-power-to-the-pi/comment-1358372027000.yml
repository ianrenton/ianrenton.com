  <p>Absolutely. I chose to power mine from the tank's main battery for a couple
  of reasons: firstly so I would only have to remember to charge one battery
  pack, and secondly because internal space -- particularly at the more
  accessible rear of the tank -- is limited.</p><p></p><p></p><p>However, the
  RPi, Wifi dingle and webcam are a constant 1.5A draw on the battery, which in
  my experience reduces run time by around 30%.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you're
  interested in running your RPi from AA batteries, you may need a voltage
  regulator (depending on the type of batteries you use). This StackExchange
  question and the pages linked from there are a pretty good summary of how
  people are doing it: <a

  in mind that, just the same as when using the tank's main battery, the RPi
  will brown-out without warning when the battery voltage drops below 5v.</p>
