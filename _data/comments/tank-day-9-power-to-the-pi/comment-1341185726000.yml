  <p>Kirsch: I did think about doing that, but drawing current from the 5V GPIO
  pin reduces the amount of current available to the Pi's USB devices.  (<a

  wanted to attach a WiFi dongle and a webcam to the USB ports, I figured I'd
  leave as much potential current spare as possible by drawing straight off the
  tank's main battery here.</p>
