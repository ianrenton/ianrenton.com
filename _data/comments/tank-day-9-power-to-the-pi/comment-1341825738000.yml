  <p>As my circuit diagram shows, the only component between the battery and the
  DCDC converter in the tank is the main power switch.  (It's a good idea to
  include a switch as the DCDC converter will draw some current from the battery
  even if the Pi is off.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If I were powering something other
  than a computer from the 5V supply I'd be tempted to protect the DCDC with
  some diodes, but the Pi isn't going to generate any significant back EMF or
  anything, so you should be fine if you're using the same model of DCDC as me. 
  Other converters might be more picky -- usually the datasheet will show you
  how to use diodes if necessary.  (<a 0=""

  1700mAh.  I've never tried powering the Pi on its own, but the Pi draws around
  250mA from the 7.2 side when powered up and idle, so that probably equates to
  around 6 hours.  When moving, shooting etc. the tank lasts about 30 minutes on
  a charge.  I'm planning to upgrade to 3000mAh LiPo batteries at some
  point!</p>
