  <p>Hi!</p><p></p><p></p><p>I got the parts from a few
  places:</p><p></p><p><ul><br><li>the tank was originally from <a

  rel="nofollow noopener">Howes Models</a><br></li><br><li>the Wifi dongle and
  USB hub came from Amazon</li><br><li>the I2C compass and rangefinder came from
  <a href="http://robot-electronics.co.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener">Robot
  Electronics</a><br></li><br><li>the Raspberry Pi and the rest of the
  electronics came from Farnell.</li><br></ul></p><p></p><p>If you're not in the
  UK, I'm not sure if Howes or Robot Electronics ship internationally, but if
  not hopefully there are similar places in your country.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In
  my setup, the Raspberry Pi acts as a WiFi base station, so the laptop sees the
  "Raspberry Tank" wireless network and connects to it. The control is all done
  via a web browser on the laptop.</p>
