  <p>The first (hopefully only) issue is probably your voltages. The TK board
  expects to be powered with something like 7-8V from the tank's battery,
  whereas you're providing 5V.  I've never tried supplying it with 5V so it
  <em>might</em> be OK, but if you're not seeing anything, I'd try giving it a
  higher voltage by connecting it to the tank's battery as it originally
  was.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Your Arduino should be just fine powered from its USB
  cable.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you have an oscilloscope, it will be easier to
  monitor the output of the TK board with that first to make sure you're
  actually seeing something, rather than jumping straight into trying to decode
  the signal on the Arduino.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Another thing to check is if
  you're pressing the "ignition" button on the remote control. For some reason
  you need to press this (even though all it normally does is make an engine
  noise) before you can start driving the tank. I believe this is controlled by
  the RX-18 rather than the TK board, so it shouldn't have any effect on what
  you're doing, but it's worth checking.</p>
