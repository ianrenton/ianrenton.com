  <p>It may not be "proper" Manchester Code — I'm no expert on these things so
  the timing may be different to the standard. However, it definitely follows
  the Manchester Code style approach in that each bit is either a high-low or a
  low-high transition. (For example, pressing a button — a one-bit change in
  information — will always swap a high and low around, never just change one of
  them.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>It is indeed very tricky to see where the bits

  some don't. It may be that if your codes aren't the same as mine, we have
  subtly different remotes / receiver boards.</p>
