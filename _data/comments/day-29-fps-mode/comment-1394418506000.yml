  <p>Yeah, the message itself comes out at around 21ms long. The 4ms low (not
  shown in the screenshot) is the time for which the signal is low before the
  start of the message (i.e. the time between one message and the next) - in
  practice I found that time varied a bit. If you're trying to capture the
  waveform, it's probably best to wait for a >=4ms low, followed by a rising
  edge, and start the capture there.</p>
