  <p>Hi!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Nice project! Im trying to do something similar
  with an Arduino.<br>Will keep both TK-board and HL Multifunction an Arduino
  will read TK:s signal and pass it through or manipulate speed
  etc</p><p></p><p></p><p>Problem is i cant figure howto read TK-signal. I have
  read your and ancvi_pIII:s  posts about problems TK signal varying in time
  etc<br>Tried all kinds of Arduino methods/libraries but no
  luck</p><p></p><p></p><p>Im no electronic geniuos and lacks knowledge. Any
  tips/hint is of interest.<br>I might have to clean up signal before it ends up
  in Arduino? Im sharing gnd and just using signal pin connected to
  Arduino</p><p></p><p></p><p>Cheers,<br>/Z</p>
