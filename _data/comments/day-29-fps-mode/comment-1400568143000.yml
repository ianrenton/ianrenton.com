  <p>Hi Ian,  Found your blog while looking in RCUniverse. Very interesting.  I
  was/am wanting to use a Rasberry with camera/WiFi to run my tank in battle. 
  We use a IR battle system instead of the BB. My goal is to put a Rasberry on
  the tank then sit over on the side and run the tank as if I am the tank
  commander. This would make our battles more interesting in that we would have
  to move slow and scout the area before moving. Angle would be slightly down as
  you would be steering useing the camera and not standing over the
  tank.<br>Long winded but here is the question.. (iknow..FINALLY)<br>Where did
  you get the parts and is the Rasberry doing the transmitting to the
  laptop?</p>
