  <p>Zoomzky, how are you reading in the signal from the TK board? If you're
  reading it using a digital input line, you may have to step up the voltage
  using a transistor as the TK board is likely to be outputting 3-4V instead of
  the 5V that the Arduino would be happier with.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You could
  sample it from an analogue input too, although you would then have the
  challenge of converting that to a digital signal within the Arduino's limited
  memory capacity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Could you share your circuit and code? It
  would help us understand what's going on with your setup!</p>
