message: "Thanks! Strange that it was down if you looked recently though, I had some problems with it originally when it was on WiFi but it's been rock solid for me since moving to wired ethernet.\r\n\r\nI hadn't heard of OpenSky before, looks pretty simple to add it in so I will do that when I get chance."
