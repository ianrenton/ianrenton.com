  <p>I would have thought that IR laser rangefinders would have degraded
  performance outside in summer, though as a photographer and someone who spends
  a lot of time on building sites, you probably know a lot more than me
  there!</p><p></p><p></p><p>We still need to do the maths on propeller/motor
  specs and chassis/equipment/payload weight.  For affordable motors and
  sensibly-sized propellers I suspect we might be talking more 'webcam' than
  'DSLR', with the latter being saved for version 2 when one of us strikes it
  rich or gets a contract from the Army :)</p><p></p><p></p><p>As far as I'm
  concerned you're very welcome to help -- give @aefaradien a poke and ask if
  he's okay with giving you write access to the wiki.  (I think you guys must
  have met IRL before, but I may be wrong...)</p>
