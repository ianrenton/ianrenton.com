  <p>What about using an IR laser as a ranging unit for
  altitude?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Also, if you were inclined to build one that
  could lift a payload of say 5-8kg for 20-40 mins you could aim for some uber
  geek cred by mounting an HDSLR in a ball turret underneath
  :D</p><p></p><p></p><p>Perhaps a small proof of concept/"doesn't matter if it
  crashes hard" testbed and then a scaled up version with camera
  mount?</p><p></p><p></p><p>I'd love to help either way.</p>
