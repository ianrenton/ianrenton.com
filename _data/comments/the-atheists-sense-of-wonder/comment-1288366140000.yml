  <p>^ Depends. Assuming the Universe is deterministic, God could, in theory,
  have kicked off the Big Bang, knowing that billions of years later the
  universe we inhabit would be the result. And the reason he did it could, in
  principle, have been so that we would happen and have this Universe to live
  in.Of course, an omnipotent god who did this would have to be a complete
  monster. Evolution works because life is a constant struggle to survive; it's
  an approach to creating complex life that depends on generation after
  generation of fear, pain and suffering. A god that would use such an approach
  when he had the power to create everything instantaneously would be either
  immeasurably cruel, or at best horrifyingly callous.</p>
