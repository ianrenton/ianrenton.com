  <p>Meh, this is one of the reasons I've started avoiding debates on omnipotent
  beings. Saying x is a reason for God to exist doesn't mean anything. Its like
  asking why does gravity follow the inverse square law? It just does. The
  relevant bit is figuring out that it does that in the first place. The why
  isn't something you can generally answer with any certainty and I'm not sure
  its something worth caring about really. Now finding out how stuff happens,
  that's interesting.</p>
