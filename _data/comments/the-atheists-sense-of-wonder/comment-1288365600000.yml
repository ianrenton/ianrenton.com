  <p>@Tom: Actually the two views mentioned are mutually exclusive. a) God
  created everything just for us, or b) a long time ago, the big bang happened.
  The view you put forward is a variation on b. Namely "a long time ago
  God/god/gods kicked everything off in what, to our best estimates, was a big
  bang and everything has come from that.</p>
