  <p>Yeah, it's an age old no-win situation, one side doesn't see how the divine
  connotation is wondrous, the other doesn't see how anything can be wondrous
  without it.  The only way to win is to just sit back and bask in the
  resplendent wonder and not give a flying fuck WHY.(though of course personally
  I will always see the divine argument as pleasant folly, no offence
  intended)</p>
