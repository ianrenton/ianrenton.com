message: "Great update to your page Ian, I have settled (for now!) on the GNOME flavour of Fedora, as I am new to Linux I found your page so very helpful, now I have put to good use an old tablet that was destined to be tucked away in a drawer and forgotten about.\r\n\r\nI found this video on YouTube quite helpful after first installing Fedora with GNOME (Helped a newbie like myself anyway). \r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/-NwWE9YFFIg"
