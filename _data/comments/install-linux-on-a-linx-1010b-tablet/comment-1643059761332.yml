message: "The example above should of course read:\r\n\r\n    chroot / /usr/bin/env disk=\"$disk\" /bin/bash\r\n\r\nI realised half way through writing up my antics that the bind mount was superfluous, but forgot to edit that one. Clearly you'd be doing $tempmount, not / in your instrucs.\r\n\r\nIan, if you're leaving some of this thread here, please just edit the previous post ( / instead of /mnt/bind ) and zap this one."
