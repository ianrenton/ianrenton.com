message: "Good luck with the Ubuntu install!\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what webcam the 1010B has unfortunately, but I will check.\r\n\r\nLooks like the Linx 7 & 8 have better support in Windows 10 20H2 than the 1010B so that's a good sign in case you need to go back. I did try a fresh Win 10 install on the 1010B a couple of months back and there were a lot of things I couldn't find working drivers for - touchscreen, audio and cameras included."
