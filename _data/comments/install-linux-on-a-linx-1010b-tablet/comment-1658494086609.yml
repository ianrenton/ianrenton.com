message: "Hi Oliver! I'm afraid I would need some more information to try and guess what's going wrong with your installs. Fedora has quite a good page explaining what can go wrong at various points in the install, and where you can find logs that contain more information: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_debug_installation_problems\r\n\r\nI've not looked at logs from Anaconda (Fedora's installer) before, but if you can find some log files from it and send them my way, there's a chance I can figure out what's going wrong.\r\n\r\nYou can also check logs from the Linux Mint installer, e.g.: https://askubuntu.com/a/758101 (Mint and Ubuntu use the same installer, so while this is \"Ask Ubuntu\", the log file will likely be the same for Mint.)\r\n\r\nOther general questions to help with this:\r\n* Do you know which part of the install it got to when you received these errors (for either operating system)?\r\n* Are you installing onto the internal drive, not onto an SD card?\r\n* Have you tried other options during the install, e.g. if it offers to download updates during the install, or install non-free drivers, have you tried changing these to the non-default choice?"
