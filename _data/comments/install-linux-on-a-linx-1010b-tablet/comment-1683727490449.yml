message: "Hi Kerry, unfortunately I'm not sure what you mean. Are you talking about the Windows login screen?\r\n\r\nIf so, underneath the PIN entry area there should be text that says \"Sign-in Options\", clicking that should reveal a button that will allow you to switch to using a password instead of a PIN.\r\n\r\nIf you're talking about Linux, PIN is not a normal method of login, so the advice would depend on what you did to set up a PIN login!"
