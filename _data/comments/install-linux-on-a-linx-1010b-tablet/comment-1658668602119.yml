message: "Ian\r\nVery many thanks for your reply. I had a look at the Fedora bug reports but couldn't see anything relevant to me. With regard to your questions:\r\nI tried reinstalling Fedora and it proceeded smoothly -\r\nCreating efi on/dev/mmcblk1p1\r\nInstalling software (0 - 100%)\r\nInstalling boot loader\r\nThen it fails giving a message\r\nThe following error occurred while installing the boot loader. The system will not be bootable. Would you like to ignore this and continue with installation?\r\nFailed to set new efi boot target. This is most likely a kernel or firmware bug.\r\nWhen I selected not to continue I got an option to report the bug to Fedora, which I did. I also was able to see and copy the installation log file as below.\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/pyanaconda/threading.py\", line 275, in run\r\n    threading.Thread.run(self)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.10/threading.py\", line 946, in run\r\n    self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/pyanaconda/installation.py\", line 400, in run_installation\r\n    queue.start()\r\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/pyanaconda/installation_tasks.py\", line 311, in start\r\n    item.start()\r\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/pyanaconda/installation_tasks.py\", line 311, in start\r\n    item.start()\r\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/pyanaconda/installation_tasks.py\", line 311, in start\r\n    item.start()\r\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/pyanaconda/installation_tasks.py\", line 496, in start\r\n    self.run_task()\r\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/pyanaconda/installation_tasks.py\", line 458, in run_task\r\n    self._task(*self._task_args, **self._task_kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/pyanaconda/installation.py\", line 339, in run_install_bootloader\r\n    sync_run_task(STORAGE.get_proxy(task))\r\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/pyanaconda/modules/common/task/__init__.py\", line 44, in sync_run_task\r\n    task_proxy.Finish()\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/dasbus/client/handler.py\", line 444, in _call_method\r\n    return self._get_method_reply(\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/dasbus/client/handler.py\", line 477, in _get_method_reply\r\n    return self._handle_method_error(error)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/dasbus/client/handler.py\", line 497, in _handle_method_error\r\n    raise exception from None\r\npyanaconda.modules.common.errors.installation.BootloaderInstallationError: Failed to set new efi boot target.
