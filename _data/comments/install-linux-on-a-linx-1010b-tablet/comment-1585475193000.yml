  Do you have Secure Boot turned on in the EFI config? That could potentially
  cause it to refuse to boot. It's worth checking if your USB stick appears as
  an option in the EFI menus as well, as you can use that to force it to boot
  from a certain device. Failing that - is the device definitely bootable? I
  know I have one memory stick (a Kingston I think) which is just never bootable
  regardless of that files are on it; a different stick with the same contents
  works fine. If you have another stick maybe give that a try.
