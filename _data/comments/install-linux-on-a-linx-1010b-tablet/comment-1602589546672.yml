message: "This guide is very helpful. my Linx tablet is not working, I guessed that internal memory is gone. after several attempts I found your page, it worked like a charm and I could open Ubuntu on my tablet. but as internal memory is no there I could not install. Then I read some other pages and installed Ubuntu on the pendrive and used it. It worked.\r\n\r\nBut I am not happy as Camera and Volme are not working. I want to install Windows 8. I read some pages on Windows togo and tried several installers like (Rufus, Yumi, Yumi-uefi, wintousb and AOMEI), but my tablet is not recognizing the the boot. If I place your Bootia32, its going to grub terminal.  \r\n\r\nCan you advise how can I load my Windows 8 ToGo pendrive  on this tablet ?"
