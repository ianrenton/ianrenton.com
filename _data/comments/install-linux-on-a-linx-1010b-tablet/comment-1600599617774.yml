message: "Hi, me again. \r\n\r\nI've followed this to the letter on Ubuntu 20.04.1 and it's worked!  I'm 99% sure I would have put the bootia32.efi file in when I tried previously. I tried it so many times so many different ways, I just can't believe I would have omitted it so many times. \r\n\r\nAnyway, a thousand thanks, Ian. It's working now and I solemnly swear I will not fiddle about with fstab again"
