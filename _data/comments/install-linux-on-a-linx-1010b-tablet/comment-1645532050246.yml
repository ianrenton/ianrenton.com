message: "Hi, this is a great tutorial, thank you.\r\nI've successfully installed this on my 1020 and it works much smoother with Wayland.\r\nI do however have one issue (of course :)) the screen rotation works the wrong way around. When connected to the keyboard it's fine but if I rotate the device to the right, so the camera is at the top, the screen is upside down and vice versa.\r\nAny advice would be appreciated."
