  I have exactly the same problem then Brt, multiple installation to try
  different OS linux, and now impossible to install correctly the 20.04 version
  without error files and don't finish the installation.... I haven't changed
  nothing in the Bios, I have tried to format the internal disk without success.
  Tried with different usb key, downloaded multiple Linux...still issue.
