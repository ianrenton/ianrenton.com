message: "No problem, thanks for reporting that Ubuntu 20.04 now seems to be working.\r\n\r\nI think the keyboard could well be a hardware issue, I often find mine is glitchy as well, usually resolved by removing the tablet from the keyboard and re-inserting it with force!\r\n\r\nI will try Ubuntu 20.04 myself in the near future and see if the keyboard seems any worse than on other OSes that could indicate a software problem."
