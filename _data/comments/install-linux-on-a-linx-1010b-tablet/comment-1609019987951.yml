message: "Hmm, I'm not super familiar with the output of Boot Repair but based on what I can see: you have a `/dev/mmcblk1p1`  that contains EFI boot files, which is what I'd expect, but they look quite different to mine. I have that `bootia32.efi` file which is referenced above (and required for it to boot properly on a Bay Trail processor) in there, whereas your paste doesn't show that file at all. I have:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@linx1010b:~# mkdir -p /tmp/bootpart\r\nroot@linx1010b:~# mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /tmp/bootpart\r\nroot@linx1010b:~# ls /tmp/bootpart/EFI/BOOT/\r\nBOOTIA32.EFI\r\nroot@linx1010b:~# ls /tmp/bootpart/EFI/ubuntu/\r\ngrub.efi  grubia32.efi\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why your install has put files for a 64-bit bootloader in there when (at least in my case) it properly detected the Bay Trail processor and used the `bootia32.efi` file in there.\r\n\r\nI've zipped up the contents of my EFI partition (`/dev/mmcblk1p1`) and [put them here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mi_H0sp6wUEKeFpqDZj4LwzoJTSOD8Vs/view?usp=sharing) for you to download. If you boot from your memory stick, mount the partition as in my example above, and unpack the zip file into there, it might work. At least I hope so, because I'm running out of ideas!"
