  <p>So close...</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ian, thanks for a really comprehensive and
  accurate guide.  I get all the way to the last step - installing the boot
  loader.  I got on error running <code>update-grub</code> saying that
  <code>GRUB_TIMEOUT</code> can't be set if <code>GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT</code> is
  also set.  So I commented out the latter.</p><p></p><p></p><p>No other errors
  displayed... but it doesn't work on reboot, going straight to windows boot
  loader instead.  Have you any suggestions?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Thanks again
  irrespective.</p>
