message: "Thank you for the information.\r\n\r\nI tried Chrome os flex, it run ok a litte slow but as of Nov 2023 they still haven't fix the screen brightness control.\r\n\r\nI also tried Fedora 38, it it nice but a little slow and sometimes crashes. I think the power control is not working as in performance mode is still slow. after a day Chrome stop working.\r\n\r\nTried to install Debian 12, not even sure how to install it, it wouldn't even connect to my wifi with lock. I made it open and tried to install but something else stop it, so just give up.\r\n\r\nI finally chose Ubuntu I just let it update while installing. The speed is very good and get 3-4 hours battery life. The sound didn't work but after the fix above its working again. Thank you again for putting this up."
