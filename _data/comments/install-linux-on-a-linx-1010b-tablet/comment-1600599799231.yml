message: "Hi me again. \r\n\r\nI've attempted this again with Ubuntu 20.04.1 and it's worked perfectly first time.\r\n\r\nI find it hard to believe that I missed the bit about bootia32.efi EVERY time I tried to install it previously, so it can't be as simple as that. \r\n\r\nAnyway, it's working now, a thousand thanks Ian"
