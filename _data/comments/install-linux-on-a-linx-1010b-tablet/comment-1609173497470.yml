message: "Brilliant, glad you got it working in the end! You're more than welcome, it's been a learning experience for us both :)\r\n\r\nOne thing to keep an eye on is any system updates that provide a new kernel. GRUB *should* be automatically reconfigured to point to the new locations, but if your tablet gets stuck in a state where it won't boot after applying updates, that's probably what's happened."
