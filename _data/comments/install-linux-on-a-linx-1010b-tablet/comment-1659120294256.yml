  It grieves me to say this, but I looks like I am going to have to take my Link
  back to Windows. I have now failed in installation of Fedora, Linux Mint and
  Ubuntu. The problem seems to relate to installation of Grub2. Everything goes
  fine up to the point of installation of grub2 and I then get an error message,
  such as 'Fedora will not boot', or 'Executing 'grub-install /dev/mmcblk1'
  failed. This is a fatal error.' Strange thing is that I can re-install Windows
  10 without error.
