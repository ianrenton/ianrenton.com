message: "Thank you for your excellent blog post on installing Fedora Core on Linx1010 Tablet. I am now sitting in Mac Donalds with a fully functioning laptop that is for terminal development and light browsing.\r\nI have one question that I can't find an answer to online that perhaps is obvious to you. There is one key on the right side that has four symbols. the #, the ~ and the pipe character and the backslash character How do you enter the pipe character and blackslash. I've tried `Alt-Key`, `Fn-key` and it's not obvious to me.\r\n\r\nThanks again. \r\n\r\nM"
