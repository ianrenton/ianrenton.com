message: "There now seems to be a solution for the sound issue, highlighted above. It is in the link that describes the problem.\r\nIt's fairly simple (but see small issues below)\r\n\r\nJust add the line:\r\noptions snd-intel-dspcfg dsp_driver=2 to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\r\nto the file:\r\n/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\r\n\r\nIt took me a while to do this, as it needs 'permissions'.\r\nI've installed xubuntu 20.04.3 (I wiped all particitions with GParted before installing).\r\n\r\nyou need to open mousepad WITH permissions:\r\nI did:\r\nsudo mousepad /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\r\nthen enter passwword\r\nThis opened mousepad, but not the file, but navigating within mousepad opened the file.\r\nI added the new line above the first 'options'\r\nThen saved.\r\n\r\nI 'restarted' twice - but the sound was slow, perhaps half speed.\r\nI then turned off.\r\nThere's a cryptic reference in the original post to 'go to Bios and save' (This is for Mint linux)\r\nBut I went into the bios  - looked around, did nothing (there are no sound controls that I can see) and then booted up.\r\nSound now works fine.\r\n(I've put the details in - I'm pretty much a n00b and not sure which bits might be relevant,"
