  That's a strange one. The "minimal bash-like editing" prompt appears when
  you're booting to GRUB, but GRUB can't find the partition(s) with its config
  in - that might well result from messing around with partitions on the
  disk/breaking fstab. But the problem there is all contained within the
  device's internal disk, nothing about that should prevent booting from USB.
  When you go into the tablet's BIOS menus with your USB stick attached, does it
  appear in the menus as one of the boot options?
