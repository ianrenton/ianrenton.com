  <p>Hi Ian, I've been messing around with doing this and managed to do this
  without your tutorial, only found this one when looking into fixing grub XD
  Typical, i spent 3 days doing what could be done in an hour with this guide
  XD<br>Anyway, i have the onboard wifi working, i will have to check what i've
  done when i get home, but so far i have wifi working, havent checked Bluetooth
  yet, but with the driver i have, i'm sure it is. i'll check the HDMI out once
  i find a cable for it, and the battery level hasn't worked yet, though i
  believe i heard that there was a driver being developed. suspending the tablet
  i don't know yet but will try that when i get home, but i hold little hope as
  that's always the last one to work</p><p></p><p></p><p>Anyway, must get back
  to work, but i will update you asap with info of the wifi</p>
