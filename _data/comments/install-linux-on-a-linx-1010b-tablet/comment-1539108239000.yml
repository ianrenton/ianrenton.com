  Here in October 2018 the issues are still far from clobbered with Bay Trail.
  However, I'm joining the 1010B fun due to a rash purchase yesterday.


  I've not checked this with anything other than Mint 19, but I seem to have
  sussed the brightness without resorting to kernel rebuilds.

  Edit /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and add these lines in order:

  pwm_lpss

  pwm_lpss_platform

  pwm_lpss_pci

  i915


  Then, sudo update-initramfs -u

  And reboot.

  This stops the i915 module loading ahead of the pwm_lpss modules.


  Inspired by https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=96571


  All the best, and thanks for the head start.
