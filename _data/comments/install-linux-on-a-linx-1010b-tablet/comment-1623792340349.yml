  First thanks for writing the tutorial. I want to install Bliss Os after
  testing the live usb which seem to work a lot better than the raw android x86.
  I am confused with the UEFI. When I am installing if I select the whole drive
  wouldn't it delet the UEFI partition as well? Should I be installing at a
  partition? I see mccblk1 as a whole drive or mccblk0p1, mccblk0p2, mccblk0p3
  and mccblk0p4 as partitions.
