message: "Ian. thanks again for your response. I have been able to install Fedora without the bootloader. However when I follow the instructions for manual installation of grub2, I appear to be able to mount mmcblk1p1 (or mmcblk1p2 as root, but when I try to mount the other as efi partition I get the message that 'mount point does not exist'.\r\nI am operating as liveuser@localhost-live, and I am not sure if I am accessing the internal storage. In file manager I can see a device called Anaconda but cannot access it and get the message that /dev/loop1 already mounted or mount point busy. File manager is also showing a 1.9 GB Volume (/run/media/liveuser/disk).\r\nAny thoughts?"
