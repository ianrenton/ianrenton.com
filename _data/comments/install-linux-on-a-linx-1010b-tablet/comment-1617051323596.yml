message: "I have been playing around with a Linx 10. Got Ubuntu working on it and for some reason it upgraded to Pop and things started acting up. Decided to try with Mint and it worked fine. Then I tried Elementary and it is perfect. Changed the theme to MacOsh and it looks like a Mac in many ways even though I have never used a Mac.\r\nI consider myself a newbie with things like this but the internet is great for finding things out."
