  I have been using EndeavorOS (Arch) on my 1010B for awhile using the newest
  ISO (As of writing Galileo Neo) using KDE Plasma desktop environment, most
  things work from the get go aside from no auto rotate but manually turning the
  screen does also flips the touch screen, although you mite be able to add that
  function.
