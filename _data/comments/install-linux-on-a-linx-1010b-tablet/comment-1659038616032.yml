  With regards to installing 22.04 I copied the bootia32.efi into the folder and
  all installed ok but on reboot I get stuck in efi shell, I can't see the 32
  grub file in the directory just the 64bit is the process of rectifying this is
  there a something I missed out, the script? 20.04 works fine btw.
