message: "#### Richard:\r\nI've tried installing Debian Bullseye on the tablet but I have not been successful. I can boot into the installer but it seems like the installer doesn't recognise the USB stick it booted from as an installation source. This is with both the netinst and full images. However I'm using a different USB stick than the one I used to use for installs on this tablet, so it might be the USB stick causing the problem rather than anything wrong with Debian.\r\n\r\nI did however find an Ubuntu 21.04 PPA for Gnome 40, which I installed following [these instructions](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2021/04/how-to-install-gnome-40-on-ubuntu-2104.html). The result isn't perfect&mdash;as you can see in this picture there are some strange visual artifacts when using the new Activities view&mdash;but I'm not sure that's specific to the Linx tablet, more likely it's just due to the software not being fully supported on Ubuntu yet. Touch screen, rotation etc. work fine.\r\n\r\n![Linx Gnome 40](https://ianrenton.com/projects/linux-on-linx-1010b-tablet/linx-gnome40.jpg)\r\n\r\n#### James:\r\nI'm not sure why simulated secondary click (i.e. long-press-to-right-click) isn't working for you if you have identical hardware and software. Are you using Xorg or the Wayland? (If you're not sure, that's the difference between the \"GNOME\"/\"Ubuntu on Wayland\" and the \"GNOME on Xorg\"/\"Ubuntu\" sessions on the login screen session list.) They handle inputs differently so if you have issues with one you could try the other. FWIW I use Wayland.\r\n\r\nThe touchscreen device won't show up in `lsusb` or `lspci`, but it will in `lsdev`&mdash;I get a line that says `GDIX1001:00`. You can also get more information using `xinput list` in Xorg or `libinput list-devices` (from the `libinput-tools` package) in Wayland.\r\n\r\n#### Zeust:\r\nThanks for the info! Unfortunately the SD card reader on my Linx is defective so I can't try this myself, but it looks like a good approach for those wanting to dual boot."
