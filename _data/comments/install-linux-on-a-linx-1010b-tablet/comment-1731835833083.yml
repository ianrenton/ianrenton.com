  Thanks for the great instructions :) I successfully installed Fedora 40
  following your instructions. After upgrading to Fedora 41 from Fedora 40, I
  started having problems with screen rotation and a significant slowdown in
  system performance. But these are my observations. Aren't you curious if Haiku
  OS will work properly?
