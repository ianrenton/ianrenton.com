  Hi, unfortunately I have not tried Windows To Go so I can't give you a
  definite solution. However, please check whether you are using 32-bit or
  64-bit Windows To Go? According to [this
  page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/planning/windows-to-go-overview#hardware-considerations-for-windows-to-go),
  with a legacy 32-bit UEFI system like the Linx 1010B, *only* 32-bit Windows To
  Go will work.
