message: "I’m afraid I don’t know what Bliss OS uses for an installer. The Android x86 software I used installs the Android partitions as files inside the Windows partition, and ties into the Windows boot process to chain them - probably why it’s so slow!\r\n\r\nYou will need an EFI partition for sure, the only question is if you select “the whole disk”, will the installer figure it out and create a new EFI partition for you as well as the OS partition(s).\r\n\r\nIf you’re not sure, picking a single partition to install into is the less risky option, so try that first!"
