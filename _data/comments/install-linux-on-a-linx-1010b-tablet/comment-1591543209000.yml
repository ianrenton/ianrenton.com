message: "Re Cameras:\r\n\r\nI saw https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-5.8-Media-Updates and figured I should take a look at the daily build from https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/ but sadly the Ubuntu daily build didn't have the relevant config set, so I built it myself. Couldn't resist posting it here as this seems to be the site with most interest in the 1010b.\r\n\r\nWord to the wise.. Turn off CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO or you'll run out of space fast. Oddly, the daily build /boot/config-5.xxx file has it set even though the binary kernel clearly doesn't. Shame Ubu don't switch on /proc/config to avoid such packaging snafus.\r\n\r\nBuilt.. Installed. dmesg shows camera(s) beng detected, then the module seems to crash. Regardless, it seems we can all hope for cameras on our 1010b's soon. I have run out of time today, but may look into submitting bug reports if this isn't resolved in the next couple of 5.8-rc builds.\r\n\r\nExtract of dmesg:\r\n\r\n[    8.867486] atomisp_gmin_platform: module is from the staging directory, the quality is unknown, you have been warned.\r\n[    8.880660] atomisp_ov2680: module is from the staging directory, the quality is unknown, you have been warned.\r\n[    8.880820] atomisp_gmin_platform: module is from the staging directory, the quality is unknown, you have been warned.\r\n[    8.884058] atomisp_ov2680: module is from the staging directory, the quality is unknown, you have been warned.\r\n[    8.945318] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: ov2680_probe: ACPI detected it on bus ID=CAM2, HID=OVTI2680\r\n[    8.945342] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: gmin: power management provided via XPower AXP288 PMIC (i2c addr 0x34)\r\n[    8.945437] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:00_CamClk\r\n[    8.945518] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:00_ClkSrc\r\n[    8.945595] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:00_CsiPort\r\n[    8.945672] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:00_CsiLanes\r\n[    8.946057] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:00_eldo1_1p8v\r\n[    8.946135] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:00_eldo1_sel_reg\r\n[    8.946214] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:00_eldo1_ctrl_shift\r\n[    8.946292] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:00_eldo2_1p8v\r\n[    8.946370] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:00_eldo2_sel_reg\r\n[    8.946447] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:00_eldo2_ctrl_shift\r\n[    8.946534] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: Failed to find gmin variable gmin_V1P8GPIO\r\n[    8.946616] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: Failed to find gmin variable gmin_V2P8GPIO\r\n[    9.045171] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: camera pdata: port: 0 lanes: 1 order: 00000002\r\n[    9.045662] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: sensor_revision id = 0x2680, rev= 0\r\n[    9.055235] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:00: register atomisp i2c module type 1\r\n[    9.093194] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:01: ov2680_probe: ACPI detected it on bus ID=CAM4, HID=OVTI2680\r\n[    9.093205] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:01: gmin: power management provided via XPower AXP288 PMIC\r\n[    9.093296] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:01: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:01_CamClk\r\n[    9.093371] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:01: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:01_ClkSrc\r\n[    9.093449] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:01: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:01_CsiPort\r\n[    9.093524] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:01: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:01_CsiLanes\r\n[    9.093900] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:01: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:01_eldo1_1p8v\r\n[    9.093982] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:01: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:01_eldo1_sel_reg\r\n[    9.094061] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:01: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:01_eldo1_ctrl_shift\r\n[    9.094139] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:01: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:01_eldo2_1p8v\r\n[    9.094217] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:01: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:01_eldo2_sel_reg\r\n[    9.094295] ov2680 i2c-OVTI2680:01: Failed to find variable OVTI2680:01_eldo2_ctrl_shift\r\n[    9.094354] RIP: 0010:gmin_subdev_add+0x2a3/0x400 [atomisp_gmin_platform]\r\n[    9.094405]  gmin_camera_platform_data+0x36/0x60 [atomisp_gmin_platform]\r\n[    9.094415]  ov2680_probe+0x12f/0x494 [atomisp_ov2680]\r\n[    9.094524]  ov2680_driver_init+0x1c/0x1000 [atomisp_ov2680]\r\n\r\nLoads omitted as this is just a taster, not a bug report."
