message: "I managed to be able to boot into ubuntu from the flash drie and update grub etc but at the final step sudo update-grub had a problem and now I have to manually load the kernels every time i boot. I ran sudo update-grub and it finishes but I still have to manually enter kernels every time I boot. On further investigation I realised that it updated the grub.cfg file that is on the partition that the ubuntu is installed and not on the efi partition so I need to perform the sudo update-grub and tell it to update the efi folder. That's why I think the problem existed in first place. It was trying to locate /boot/grub on the big .ext4 where ubuntu was installed rather than the specifically efi created partition...\r\nGood news is that everything is up and running, but bad news I have to manually load kernels everytime. I'm sure there has to be a way to solve it."
