message: "In case more people might be interested, I managed to install Linux to an SD card and get it dual-booted with Windows! It did take some trial and error, because the EFI bootloader doesn't have access to the SD card yet, so you need a /boot partition on the tablet's built-in storage. So basically the layout is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/dev/mmcblk2p1 /        (root partition on SD card)\r\n/dev/mmcblk1p5 /boot    (boot partition on built-in storage)\r\n/dev/mmcblk1p1 /boot/efi (existing EFI system partition)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- You need to shrink the Windows volume in order to create the boot partition. A boot partition size of 500 MB should be more than enough.\r\n- While using the (pre-existing) EFI system partition as your /boot partition is considered a valid choice on many machines, don't do that on this tablet. It's only 100 MB and will fill up before your bootloader is properly installed and configured. And since it's at the start of the disk, it can't be enlarged unless you completely throw away your Windows volume.\r\n- I would recommend using a \"high endurance\" SD card, since these have wear leveling just like an SSD, and as a result will survive many more write operations than regular SD cards. These seem hardly more expensive than regular ones; I got a high endurance 128 GB micro-SD card for under â‚¬20, and my system is running smoothly from it."
