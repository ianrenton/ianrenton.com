message: "There's no such thing as a \"hidden\" folder in Linux really, apart from the convention of hiding filenames beginning with `.`. The problem might be that you're looking in `/dev/mmcblk1p2` instead of `/dev/mmcblk1p1` while you're investigating?\r\n\r\nRegardless, I don't think just copying that directory will work. I suspect you have a second problem here - the installer didn't detect your Bay Trail 32-bit EFI issue properly, so not only has it not put `BOOATIA32.EFI` in the right area, it's also installed a 64-bit grub instead of a 32-bit one.\r\n\r\nThis used to be a problem with Ubuntu prior to 18.04, so there are some steps [here](#bootinternalfromusb) that I originally used to resolve it. Essentially what you will have to do is use grub on your memory stick, tweak the boot options so it actually boots your installed Ubuntu, then once you're inside that environment, install 32-bit grub. As well as my instructions above, there's also [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@realzedgoat/a-sorta-beginners-guide-to-installing-ubuntu-linux-on-32-bit-uefi-machines-d39b1d1961ec) that has a simpler method of following of the same process - scroll down to \"Fixing your new installation, and, whatâ€™s GRUB?\". I'd suggest starting with their process.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps. I still don't quite understand why you're having this trouble whereas for me it correctly detected the 32-bit EFI problem and installed 32-bit grub right from the installer. Are you *definitely* using Ubuntu 20.04.1 and a LINX 1010B, not another variant?"
