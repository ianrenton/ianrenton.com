  I think I remember seeing this issue before with an older version of Ubuntu,
  maybe 19.04 or 19.10, but it fixed itself in 20.04. Which version are you
  using? If it's a later version it could be a regression that's been introduced
  then - or if you have the problem on 20.04 it could be an issue unique to the
  Linx 1020.
