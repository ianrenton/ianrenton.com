  This is really weird. I'm thinking the same as you -  I can't understand what
  the Ubuntu install could be doing to the PC so that it can't then boot from
  USB, because booting from USB should be handled at the BIOS/UEFI level and not
  touched by Ubuntu. Rob Smith/Brt you using 20.04 as well as Marc0? I will add
  a warning to the top of the page as this seems like a repeatable issue now
  that more than one person has reported it.
