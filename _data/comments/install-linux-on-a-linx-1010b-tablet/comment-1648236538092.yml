  Oh, nice. I will give that a try tomorrow. If Fedora is working reliably I may
  update this page to recommend it, since Ubuntu support seems to have regressed
  in the last year or so. Howâ€™s KDE on the touchscreen? Last time I tried it, I
  think I had issues with auto-rotate and the on screen keyboard, but that was
  probably 2020 or so.
