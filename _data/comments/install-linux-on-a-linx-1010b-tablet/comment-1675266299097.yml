message: "Well I'm stunned, thanks for this\r\n\r\nI just managed to get Fedora 37 working on an old Linx 8.1 tablet I was going to junk\r\n\r\nI did have a few issues, mainly caused by the tablet only having a single micro USB port so the entire install had to be done on battery, which ran out while the installation process said it was configuring software, but on reboot I was amazed to find Fedora was on there and appears to work\r\n\r\nThe screen is smaller so I used accessibility to set a larger font, my eyes not being what they were\r\n\r\nNot perfect, but it's something to work on\r\n\r\nIf anyone else wants to try this, I used a 3 USB2 + power to micro USB adapter like this one https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zerone-Adapter-Android-Tablet-Smartphone-default/dp/B07P8KW6SX/ref=sr_1_27\r\n\r\nMy adapter is made by Suyama, I had a keyboard, mouse & flash drive hooked in, power connected & switched to charge, switching to OTG killed the tablet, so you may have to play around with settings as other manufacturers may differ\r\n\r\nThat seemed to provide power to the devices but not the tablet, so I fully charged the tablet & crossed my fingers\r\n\r\nOther note, I had to use safe graphics or the screen would blank & the install would stop, scroll down to the \"Troubleshooting\" entry in the initial grub menu to get to safe/basic graphics\r\n\r\nAnd if you brick your tablet don't blame me, I was going to junk mine anyway if this didn't work"
