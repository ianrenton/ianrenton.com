  Got an update on the situation! I tried the advanced partitioning in the
  install process and deleted everything so there is no windows boot loader on
  the system any more BUT after a successful installation on ubuntu, when the
  system boots it says ubuntu boot failed. I go to the bios and i see that it
  recognises ubuntu as an option to boot but it fails to boot and doesnt show
  why. Using ubuntu from the usb stick performs as expected though and the
  installation process completes. There has to be something I'm missing...
