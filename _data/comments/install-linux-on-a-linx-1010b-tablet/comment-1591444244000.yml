  First thank you so much for this tutorial page, you have given at my old
  tablet linx 1020 (1020b if i remember) a new life! So i have tried lot of
  things: i have downloaded the last 20.04 ubuntu and all worked well, wifi,
  rotation screen, sound,...but onboard keyboard not present, some lags/freeze,
  very not good in a long use. Then i have decided to install the 19.10 version
  with actually i m writting this reply and absolutly all work very well but not

  need find some tips to set up all that! i need to find how to do the long
  press click etc...read again this tutorial ehehe
