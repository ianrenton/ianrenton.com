  Hi Ian. I am new to Linux, just having dual boot installed Linux Mint on my
  laptop. I have tried to install Fedora as recommended on my old Linx 1010
  (wiping Windows) . Installation starts fine but in the middle it stops and
  gives a message to say that it will not boot - "kernel or firmware problem". I
  can continue installation but no boot at the end. Have also tried install g
  Linux Mint adding the bootia32.Efi but fails also with message "Fatal error".
  Any suggestions?
