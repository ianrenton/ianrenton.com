message: "Congratulations for this awesome guide, Ian!\r\n\r\nI got stuck for a while trying to boot into BIOS. No matter what combo of keys I pressed, the tablet went right into Windows 8 again.\r\n\r\nFinally I found the \"Power options\" in configuration. Some reboot from different media options showed up and finally I was able to boot from an usb stick."
