message: "I'm not entirely sure what mount points are used by the installer - I will have to go back through and try it. Within an installed copy of Fedora I would expect `/dev/mmcblk1p1` (the EFI partition) to be mounted to `/boot/efi` but the installer could well use some other location such as `/mnt/boot/efi`.\r\n\r\nIt will indeed fail to mount if the directory doesn't exist - you can always create it first with `mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi` then try mounting it again.\r\n\r\nIf you're still having trouble, it would be interesting to know what partitions are on your internal disk. Run the following from the installation environment after the install \"completes\" (or fails):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo parted /dev/mmcblk1 print\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd see how they compare to mine:\r\n\r\n```\r\nModel: MMC 032G72 (sd/mmc)\r\nDisk /dev/mmcblk1: 31.3GB\r\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\r\nPartition Table: gpt\r\nDisk Flags: \r\n\r\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system  Name                  Flags\r\n 1      1049kB  630MB   629MB   fat32        EFI System Partition  boot, esp\r\n 2      630MB   1704MB  1074MB  ext4\r\n 3      1704MB  31.3GB  29.6GB  btrfs\r\n```\r\n\r\nHopefully there will be some difference there between yours and mine that will indicate where the problem lies.\r\n\r\nFor information, you can also run the following command to show if and where various partitions are currently mounted:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncat /etc/mtab | grep /dev/mmcblk1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output below is from an installed and working Fedora environment; the mount points will look different from the installation environment and will probably change several times during the install:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/dev/mmcblk1p3 / btrfs rw,seclabel,relatime,compress=zstd:1,ssd,space_cache=v2,subvolid=257,subvol=/root 0 0\r\n/dev/mmcblk1p3 /home btrfs rw,seclabel,relatime,compress=zstd:1,ssd,space_cache=v2,subvolid=256,subvol=/home 0 0\r\n/dev/mmcblk1p2 /boot ext4 rw,seclabel,relatime 0 0\r\n/dev/mmcblk1p1 /boot/efi vfat rw,relatime,fmask=0077,dmask=0077,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=winnt,errors=remount-ro 0 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat you should eventually end up with is the following files in your EFI partition, as reported by the following command (again, from inside an installed copy of Fedora, this won't work from the installation environment:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo ls -R /boot/efi/EFI\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/boot/efi/EFI:\r\nBOOT  fedora\r\n\r\n/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT:\r\nBOOTIA32.EFI  BOOTX64.EFI  fbia32.efi  fbx64.efi\r\n\r\n/boot/efi/EFI/fedora:\r\nBOOTIA32.CSV  gcdia32.efi  grub.cfg\t grubx64.efi  mmx64.efi  shimia32.efi\r\nBOOTX64.CSV   gcdx64.efi   grubia32.efi  mmia32.efi   shim.efi\t shimx64.efi\r\n```"
