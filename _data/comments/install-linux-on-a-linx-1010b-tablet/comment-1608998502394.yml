  Secure boot settings look fine. Yeah, could be worth trying 20.04.1 in case
  there's a problem with installing 20.10. I'm running 20.10 at the moment but I
  did an upgrade from a 20.04.1 install, so if you can get the earlier version
  to install, you should be able to upgrade without a problem.
