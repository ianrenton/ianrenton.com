message: "For me at least, (using LinuxMint 20.3), sound is working fine up to and including kernel 5.11, but the Ubuntu 5.13 and 5.14 kernels seem to break bytcr-rt5640 built-in audio, seeing it as plain rt5640 AFAICT.\r\nThis may mean our beloved Linx's sound may be broken in future releases.\r\nBluetooth etc. audio are fine still.\r\nI've filed a bug at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta-hwe-5.13/+bug/1958410 so if you can see this behaviour too, please up the bug-heat on it by clicking that it affects you too."
