message: "I wish I knew! As well as your suggestions, there's also using `AltGr` in combination&mdash;but while this does produce alternative characters, they're accents rather than what's drawn on the key.\r\n\r\nIf you need a pipe character, that appears when using `AltGr`+`backtick` (the key to the left of `1`), and if you want a backslash, you can use `AltGr`+`-` (minus)."
