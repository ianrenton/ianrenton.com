message: "Thanks, you make a good point about the need for `apt update` so I will include that in the script.\r\n\r\nGlad you have the 22.04 beta working, I will give that a try myself at some point in the run up to the release next month. It's a shame that with the 32-bit grub issue support for Bay Trail seems to have regressed since 20.04!"
