  Thank you Ian, since my last message I completely messed up the install, and
  only today managed to get Fedora 29 up and running on it (I had to create a
  start up disk on my Android phone using an app! as I messed up my live usb
  copy of Ubuntu) I will have a good go at it at the weekend and see if I cannot
  break it this time! , although I must admit tinkering with different distros
  is kind of fun, seeing which ones work, I am totally new to Linux so forgive
  my lack of knowledge.
