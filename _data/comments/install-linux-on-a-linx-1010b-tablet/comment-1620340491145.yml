  Thanks for this excellent tutorial. I managed to get Ubuntu 20.04.2.0 working
  on my old Linx 1020 tablet following your instructions (I will add that I
  needed to have internet connected for it to install properly - otherwise it
  fails at the installation of the local grub 32 bit boot module). However, for
  me the touch screen did not work at all - only the physical keyboard and
  touchpad or USB mouse. I tried rebooting with these disconnected but then I
  couldn't input anything. I know the touch screen works because it works on the
  tablet BIOS pages. Any idea how I might manually install the drivers or
  otherwise fix this? Thanks.
