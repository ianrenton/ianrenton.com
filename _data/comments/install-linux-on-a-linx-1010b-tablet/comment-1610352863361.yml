message: "Hi Ricardo,\r\n\r\nThe Linuxium modifications are designed to improve Bay Trail support in Ubuntu so I doubt they would make anything *worse* - therefore I think it's likely that the touchscreen won't work on Ubuntu either.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's no harm in trying! The Ubuntu installer lets you try out Ubuntu in a live environment from the USB stick before installation, so you can see if the touchscreen works there before making any commitment.\r\n\r\nThe Linx 1010B uses a Goodix touchscreen so if it's similar, you should be in luck. If it's a Silead device there are some [unofficial kernel drivers here](https://github.com/sigboe/gslX68X) which may help. Unfortunately I don't have this device so I can't say if they will work or not."
