message: "#### Windows 10 Results\r\n\r\n* Downloaded Windows 10 22H2 image and wrote it to a USB stick, along with the new drivers\r\n* Booted the tablet from it and installed Windows\r\n* Chose not to connect to the internet, to prevent driver download (and being nagged for a Microsoft account)\r\n\r\nOut of the box experience:\r\n\r\n* Attached keyboard and touchpad work\r\n* WiFi works\r\n* No touchscreen\r\n* No automatic rotation\r\n* No sound (output or input)\r\n* No camera\r\n* No Bluetooth\r\n* No battery level\r\n\r\nI then installed the provided driver set, restarting when prompted and once again at the end. Note that for the touchscreen driver, the included \"install.exe\" doesn't seem to work, but going into the subfolder and installing the INF directly does work.\r\n\r\nAfter installing the drivers:\r\n\r\n* Touchscreen works\r\n* Automatic rotation works\r\n* Sound works (output and input)\r\n* Camera works\r\n* Battery level works\r\n* Still no Bluetooth\r\n\r\nI then connected to the internet and allowed the tablet to update itself according to the default settings. This included automatic updates to the graphics and touchscreen drivers. After a full set of updates, the status was still as above.\r\n\r\nTo round things off, I then went into Optional Updates and installed the Realtek Bluetooth driver from there. Once installed, Bluetooth started working again&mdash;so I believe that's now a fully functional tablet on the latest Windows 10!\r\n\r\nCharlie, are you happy for me to re-host your ZIP file of drivers to make it available to visitors to this page? It might help out folks who are trying to go back to Windows after playing with Linux.\r\n\r\n#### Windows 11 Results\r\n\r\nAs I kind of expected from the beginning, Windows 11 is unlikely to be possible on this device. Bay Trail, with its weird 64-bit processor but 32-bit bootloader situation, is too old for Windows 11 to support. Out of the box it just doesn't boot. If I take `/efi/boot/bootia32.efi` from a Windows 10 ISO and add it to my Windows 11 USB stick, I can at least get it to boot, but all I get is a \"Recovery\" screen that complains about the lack of a 64-bit processor. I don't believe anyone's got even 64-bit Windows 10 running on the 1010B, so it's probably not worth spending much more time trying 11."
