message: "No problem. I'm still trying to figure out what your issue might be but without much success!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately my 1010B is at work at the moment and I can't grab it to play with BIOS settings for another week or so, but you could try [Method 4 & 5 listed here](https://thegeekpage.com/acpi-bios-error/) and see if the 1010B has comparable BIOS settings to the ones in the picture?\r\n\r\nIf I recall correctly the 1010B BIOS settings are pretty limited compared to a \"real\" PC motherboard but it's worth a shot."
