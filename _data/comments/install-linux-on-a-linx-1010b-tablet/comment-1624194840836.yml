message: "Thanks for the explanation. I found a windows 10 restore image for Linx 1010b so I just did a whole hard disk install and it worked fine. And the tablet is now working nicely with Bliss os 11.14 Thanks\r\n\r\nI found the restored image on this forum by JaydenTheYT. I have not tested it as my install work out fine, I did open it and look inside and look like the real thing.\r\nhttps://www.overclockers.co.uk/forums/threads/linx-tablet-drivers-and-bios-downloads.18641103/page-4\r\n\r\nDirect download link here:\r\nhttps://mega.nz/#!mYwEjSxA!gzjpH68-dArLal6oX6QDujxQdoJmPic7SRb_8tHQyGY"
