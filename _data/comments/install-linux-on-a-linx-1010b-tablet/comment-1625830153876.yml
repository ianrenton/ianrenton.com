message: "Ziad,\r\nI'm not 100% sure as your device is slightly different to mine, but if the OEM Windows install doesn't work properly, you could always try downloading the Windows 10 installer from [Microsoft's page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10). Make sure to select 32-bit not 64-bit.\r\n\r\nYou may end up having to hunt for drivers though, I'm not sure if the stock Windows 10 install will have all the drivers it needs for a Linx 1020."
