message: "Thanks for all the useful info. I got a 1010L cheaply a while ago as the windows 10 updates wouldnt fit on the smaller 16gb storage. Ive managed to use it quite well with xubuntu  apart from one thing that has never worked: Shutting down!\r\n\r\nWhen I try to shut it down, either by shutdown -h now or via the GUI it will go through the whole process, the screen will turn off, but then about 5 seconds later it will start up again. It seems that sometimes it will shut down if I have power plugged in, but its not guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThe only way to get it powered off safely is to halt it then hold the power button until it powers off. Has anyone else got this issue or any ideas on how to fix it?"
