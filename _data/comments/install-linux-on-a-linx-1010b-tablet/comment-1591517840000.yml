  Hi ian, thank you for your reply! So Screen rotation accelerometer is inverted
  and long-press does not trigger right-click like you described in this post.
  Yes when i am in portrait the screen is upside down, not in the good way.
  Longpress activated in the Universal access, all is set up good but still
  doesn't. I looking for too in the internet if i find somethings to improve
  feature on this tablet.
