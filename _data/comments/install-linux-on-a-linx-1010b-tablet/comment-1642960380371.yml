message: "Ah ok.. thanks. You may want to trim the cruft, please feel free to trim/edit/remove any of my posts.. above, please change \"grep $target\" to \"grep $t\"\r\n\r\nI'm typing from the booted USB of 21.10 :-) I'd chrooted into it, nano /etc/default/grub and in the hope of seeing more boot stuff, commented out\r\n    #GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\r\nand for less neck-twisting, eye straining, added\r\n    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"fbcon=rotate:1\"\r\n\r\nre-ran update-grub. When booting, I'd been selecting the UEFI USB option from firmware... mistake.. the plain USB option was the winner. Wait before you edit anything in your tutorial though..as after all the updates and checks I'm running I'll revert that and see if if breaks boot, or fixes the next bit:-\r\n\r\nAuto-rotate screen was working in the installer, but not here in the installed system. That may be due to my setting rotate in grub.\r\n\r\nThis is likely just the Linx WiFi not liking my particular AP, but I had to turn WiFi off and on again to get a connection. (I often  have to do that in my normal Mint too, and usually only with my home AP. If I use an ESP-01 or my phone as an AP, it hooks up immediately.)\r\n\r\nSo 21.10 can be installed from scratch and work, with no more than one chroot to fix it. A slow USB stick is not the optimal target though. apt upgrade is still running. I'll let you know in a few boots, after checking the newer kernels in-place if the grub settings were relevant."
