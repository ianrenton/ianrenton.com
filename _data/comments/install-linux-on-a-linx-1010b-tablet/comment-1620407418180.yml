message: "I found a 'solution' for the Linx 1020 touch screen not working problem - it is a real quirk. Here it is:\r\n\r\n1. With a USB mouse or the keyboard-trackpad attached, go to the top right menu that gives you the power down options and select 'Suspend'.\r\n2. After screen blanks out and power goes to suspend, short press the main power button on the back of the tablet to bring the unit out of suspend mode.\r\n3. Now the tablet will accept touch screen input and you can discard the keyboard/mouse.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, when you are on the GNOME login page you can just do a short press on the tablet power button to put the unit into 'Suspend' and then another short press to bring it out of suspend and have touch screen activation. This method doesn't need a keyboard attached at any stage so may be better than the above but does not work when you are not on the login page - when you have already logged in this does not provide a 'Suspend' option (only 'Restart', 'Power Off' or 'Cancel').\r\n\r\nI found that this trick worked even at the installation from USB stage (because the problem occurs even from that time). So when installing 20.04.2 from USB as per the instructions in this blog, when the first install window comes up in the GNOME desktop environment, you will need an attached mouse or trackpad to do the above 'trick' to get your touch screen working and then you can continue the installation with touch screen alone. After install, on the final 'Restart' stage when it tells you to remove the removable media and press 'ENTER' you can just do a long press (about 10 seconds) on the main tablet power button to force a reboot instead (if you don't want to add a physical keyboard just to press 'Enter').\r\n\r\nBefore I found this I tried 20.1 in-place upgrade (v 19.10 is no longer available for download) but this didn't fix the problem (it just made the login screen appear in portrait mode and messed up the accelerometer effect by rotating 180 degrees out of sync whereas 20.04.2 got it almost right). Also, v20.1 had strange behaviour with the accelerometer - it only worked when the physical keyboard was attached. It was while messing about with 20.1 that I discovered the above workaround but when I removed the physical keyboard the accelerometer no longer worked at all and when I put the physical keyboard back on the accelerometer worked again. It is for that reason I decided to try again with 20.04.2 using the 'Suspend' trick and it worked.\r\n\r\nNow both touch screen and accelerometer screen autorotation work but the portrait modes are upside down. If you have any advice to fix that I would be grateful.\r\n\r\nI hope this experience will help others with a Linx 1020.\r\n\r\nThanks again for making this really useful blog."
