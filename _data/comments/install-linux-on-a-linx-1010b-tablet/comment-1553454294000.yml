message: "Hi - thanks for your guide I found it really helpful. I managed to install MX Linux which worked okay after some fiddling about, then I did some research and downloaded Fedora 29 with Gnome, most things work out of the box including sound and no need to place boot files for 32 bit uefi as this is already included in the ISO. I haven't managed to get the cameras running yet but will persist and update here when I succeed. I have completely ditched W10 as it got on my nerves an am typing this on my Linx 1010B via Chrome (Flash &amp; Widevine function out of the box). \r\n\r\nOnce again thanks for sharing."
