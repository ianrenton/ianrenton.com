message: "Thanks Matt, I did try the botched bit but I got lost somewhere, I \r\nwill have another look at it but at the moment I am using 20.04 & seems to be working fine, is there many upgrades which are worth the installation?\r\nI am using bluetooth audio output to my amp which is working fine, the performance is so much better than windows."
