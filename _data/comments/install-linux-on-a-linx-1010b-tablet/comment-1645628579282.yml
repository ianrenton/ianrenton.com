message: "Thanks for your reply Ian.\r\nI am using 20.04.3, it is really frustrating, I've researched the web and as yet not found a solution but I can't believe it's that difficult or even uncommon, of course what do I know? :)\r\nIn landscape it's fine, in portrait it's upside down, it probably just changing a line in a script somewhere.\r\nAnyways, all the best."
