  <p>Not in perpetuity (which was probably a poor way of phrasing it).  What I
  mean is, because Android releases the OS code as AOSP, you can replace your
  stock OS with one based on AOSP so that you will always be able to maintain
  root access while receiving OS upgrades.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Apple do not
  release the code to allow others to build custom versions of iOS -- so
  although iOS devices can be jailbroken, every time the OS is updated by Apple,
  hackers must find a new exploit in order to re-enable
  jailbreaking.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I will root/jailbreak whatever device I get,
  but I prefer the security of knowing that I will be able to update my OS
  regularly and maintain root access, rather than having to hold off on updating
  until some enterprising hacker has found another hole to exploit to get my
  root back again.</p>
