  <p>I notice there is a general trend of increasing facial hair through these
  photos, with the exception of RABIES 5.  Has this become a rule
  yet?</p><p></p><p></p><p>If aging brain serves me correctly I missed the first
  RABIES, attended 2 & 3, then haven't been to any since then as the older
  generation progresively moved on and the people I went to meet with were
  generally not there anymore.  Does bring back memories though.</p>
