  most cringeworthy sex scenes I've seen in mainstream
  cinema?</p><p></p><p></p><p>I mean, there are some pretty bad ones, but a
  painfully dragged out closeup of suited-up Night Owl's sweaty arse gyrating
  slowly to Hallelujah (previously a beloved song of mine) was harrowing, to say

  hilarious expressions of what I can only assume to be silent screams of abject
  horror.</p>
