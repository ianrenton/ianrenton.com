  <p>I got the same "FAILD (remote: not allowed)" error as Paffy, so apparently
  I don't have the engineering hboot. I can't get past the white HTC screen when
  I try to reboot.<br>I messed up my CWM somehow, so I'm trying to reflash it.
  But again, I have the wrong hboot.<br>Is there a way I can install just the
  eng hboot without having access to the phone itself?</p>
