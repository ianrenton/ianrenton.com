  <p>If the developers can't justify it, I have no hope! :)  I'm pretty sure the
  Gingerbread AOSP releases came as ext4 and developers adopted it for that
  reason.  Whether ext4 is actually required or if it was just kept rather than
  go through the hassle of building the image as ext3 instead, I have no
  idea!</p>
