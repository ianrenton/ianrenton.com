  <p>I can only speak from experience, but I've been running my phone's main
  partition as ext4 for around 10 months now without issues.  I'm not sure that
  ext4 is significantly faster than ext3 -- it's certainly not so much faster
  that it would cause any issues for the CPU or RAM in the phone (it's still an
  order of magnitude slower than cache or RAM).</p><p></p><p></p><p>The only
  related issue you <em>might</em> want to watch out for is ext3/4 partitions on
  the SD card -- as SD cards are quoted to withstand a certain number of
  read/write operations, it's possible that journalling file system such as
  ext3/4 will chew through SD card life more quickly than non-journalling
  filesystems such as ext2 or FAT32.</p><p></p><p></p><p>However, as you're
  talking just about the phone's internal storage being bumped from ext3 to
  ext4, this is not a concern. In fact, aside from the fact that Gingerbread
  ROMs will work, I'd be surprised if you noticed any difference!</p>
