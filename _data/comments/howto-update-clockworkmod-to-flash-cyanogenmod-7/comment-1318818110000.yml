  <p>Hi,<br>I'm seeing more and more ROMs coming out with EXT4 partitioned
  system but this is a question that I haven't managed to find the answer
  to...</p><p></p><p></p><p>I was wondering if it is completely safe to use EXT4
  with the Desire HD's hardware due to EXT4 being faster than
  EXT3?</p><p></p><p></p><p>I know that since Gingerbread Android officially
  supports EXT4 and that the Nexus S is using it, but the Desire HD is a bit
  older than Nexus S and I just wanted to be sure that it's hardware and memory
  chip can take EXT4 pounding with no risk of shortening it's life. Oh, and I
  mean all this about the internal storage chip of the device, not about
  creating an EXT4 partition on the SD card.</p>
