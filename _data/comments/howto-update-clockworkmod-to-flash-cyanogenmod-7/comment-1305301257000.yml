  <p>First ensure that your version of ROM Manager is up-to-date - the latest I
  can see in the Market is v4.2.0.2.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Open ROM Manager, and
  the top item should be "Flash ClockworkMod Recovery".  Press that, and it
  should download and flash the latest CWM (3.0.2.6 at the moment) for you.</p>
