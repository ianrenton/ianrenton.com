  <p>Yep, there's no official release candidate for CM7 yet, so we're still
  using the automatically-generated nightly builds.  You can get them from <a
  href="http://mirror.teamdouche.net/?device=ace" rel="nofollow
  noopener">http://mirror.teamdouche.net/?device=ace</a> or straight from ROM
  Manager if you have the Premium version.  (ROM Manager will still happily
  download the ROMs, even though it can't talk to CWM 3 in order to
  automatically flash them.)  Go for the latest, which right now is
  #31.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Google Apps are here: <a
  href="http://goo-inside.me/gapps/" rel="nofollow
  noopener">http://goo-inside.me/gapps/</a>  -- you want what's under
  "CyanogenMod 7" and "Universal-DPI" in the table, which right now is <code><a
  href="http://gapps-gb-20110120-signed.zip" rel="nofollow
  noopener">gapps-gb-20110120-signed.zip</a></code>.  Flash that after
  CyanogenMod using the same method.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you're moving from
  Froyo to Gingerbread, you'll need to do a full wipe first, but moving between
  CM7 nightly builds doesn't require a wipe of your data.</p>
