  <p>Yes Ian I came across that particular thread which concerned the Samsung
  Epic, but in the world of Samsung phones things are a lot different. As far as
  I have read RFS is a completely different file system and the differences
  between it and ext4 could be pretty large. As in the case of our beloved DHD,
  it comes with ext3 by default so the difference could be just
  slight.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I've been asking even the ROM developers
  themselves on the forums why they chose ext4 (presumably they know what
  they're doing more than I do), but no one stood up to clarify that matter
  entirely.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Anyway, you've been of great help, I might even
  say that you've been the most helpful person I came across, so I thank you a
  lot for that.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Cheers</p>
