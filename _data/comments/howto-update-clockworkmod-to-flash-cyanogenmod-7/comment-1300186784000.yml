  :)</p><p></p><p></p><p>First of all, try wiping /boot (from CWM's advanced
  menu) as well as wipe/factory reset, as I don't think the wipe does /boot
  normally.  Then try restoring from your Nandroid again.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If
  things still aren't working, you could try following my procedure to re-flash
  CWM3 manually, in case something went wrong when you flashed it the first
  time.</p><p></p><p></p><p>And if you're flashing CM7 (or any other ROM), make
  sure the MD5 sums match (just in case).</p><p></p><p></p><p>I found this

  so someone has got it working, and it must be possible!</p><p></p><p></p><p>As
  an absolute last resort, flash back to CWM2, restore your Nandroid backup, and
  at least you'll have a working phone again while we figure out what went
  wrong!</p>
