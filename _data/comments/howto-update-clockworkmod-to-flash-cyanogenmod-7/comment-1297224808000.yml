  <p>Hmm, I haven't seen that one before.  If you definitely get <code>writing
  recovery... OKAY</code> when running <code>fastboot flash recovery</code>, I
  can't see any reason why it wouldn't take.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A couple of
  suggestions offered by the internet:</p><p></p><p></p><p>1) Try erasing the
  recovery partition first, so:<br><code>fastboot erase recovery<br>fastboot
  flash recovery ./ace-cwm3src3.0.0.5-1-15-11.img</code></p><p></p><p></p><p>2)
  Try flashing from a file stored on the phone, so first mount your phone as
  mass storage over USB, copy the <code>.img</code> to your SD card, unmount but
  leave it connected, then run:<br><code>adb shell flash_image recovery
  /sdcard/ace-cwm3src3.0.0.5-1-15-11.img</code></p><p></p><p></p><p>Hopefully
  one of those will work for you!</p>
