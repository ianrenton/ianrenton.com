  <p>I'm not sure, I'm afraid I just followed the guides around the 'net that
  execute the <code>dd</code> command from the phone.  This might be one for the
  xda-developers or CyanogenMod forums I'm afraid!</p><p></p><p></p><p>When you
  say you can't get past the white HTC screen, is that booting normally (press
  power button) or booting into HBOOT (vol down + power)?  It sounds to me like
  you may not have a working ROM, and maybe not a working Recovery either, but
  if you can't even get into HBOOT, you have bigger problems
  :(</p><p></p><p></p><p>Retry getting into HBOOT by holding vol down, pressing
  power, and releasing vol down when the display comes on.  If that drops you
  into HBOOT, all is not lost!</p>
