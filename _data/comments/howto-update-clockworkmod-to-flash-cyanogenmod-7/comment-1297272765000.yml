  <p>Yep, that's normal.  ClockworkMod 3 is still considered experimental, and
  ROM Manager doesn't support it yet.  (For example, if you download a ROM with
  ROM Manager it'll give you the usual "Backup / Wipe" options that attempt to
  fire off CWM commands automatically on rebooting into Recovery, but they don't
  work.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>Once ROM Manager supports CWM 3, you'll be able to
  upgrade CWM 3.0.0.5 to newer versions direct from ROM Manager, but I don't
  know how long it'll be before that happens.</p>
