  <p>Ok, thanks a lot for your quick reply, I really appreciate
  it!</p><p></p><p></p><p>And yeah, my main concern was that I've read quite a
  few reviews on ext4 on SD cards being a bit dangerous about the lifespan of
  the card itself, and since I can't seem to find more details about Desire HD's
  internal memory chip type and does it even have wear leveling which is
  required for ext4, I thought it was the same type of flash memory an got a bit
  concerned.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I know from reading that the default file
  system type of a stock Desire HD is ext3 and that even the latest HTC kernels
  only support up to ext3 but I've been seeing more and more developers
  encouraged to use ext4 on their new coming ROMs and I can't seem to find an
  answer for this.</p><p></p><p></p><p>HTC as usual don't even bother giving me
  an answer through their support; I'm getting the generic "the device has been
  rooted and we don't support rooted phones" answer.</p>
