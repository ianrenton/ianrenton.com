  <p>No problem. As you probably already know, OSX doesn't use the <a
  href="http://X.org" rel="nofollow noopener">X.org</a> display server that most
  Linuxes use, so this solution won't be much help for you. Unfortunately I
  don't have enough OSX experience to know where similar settings would be
  stored.</p>
