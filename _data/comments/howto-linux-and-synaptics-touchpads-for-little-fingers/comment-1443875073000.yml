  <p>Thank you for writing up your solution. I have over here, the exact
  converse of the problem I believe :)<br>My baby loves nothing more than to
  swipe and click the trackpad while were are watching some entertainment
  together. I would love if the driver on OS X could be tweaked to mask out all
  of her tiny finger inputs... will keep searching.</p>
