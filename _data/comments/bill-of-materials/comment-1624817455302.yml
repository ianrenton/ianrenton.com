  Fabrizio, I'm not sure if you're still checking this site but you might like
  to know that I am now essentially copying what you're doing - I am upgrading
  Plane/Sailing to run on a single Raspberry Pi 4. I will be updating the build
  guides in the next few weeks to reflect the build process, so if you didn't
  manage to figure it out, I should have a better guide for you shortly!
