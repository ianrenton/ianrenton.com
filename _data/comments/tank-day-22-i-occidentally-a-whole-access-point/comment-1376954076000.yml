  <p>I'm not sure I understand what you mean. The entries in
  <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> are for the Raspberry Pi, which gets
  <code>wlan0</code> set up with IP 192.168.0.1, netmask
  255.255.0.0.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This is nothing to do with the laptop's IP,
  which is allocated by DHCP by <code>dnsmasq</code> from the range 192.168.0.50
  to 192.168.0.150. The laptop's netmask of 255.255.255.0 is not specifically
  set anywhere, so this would appear to be a default provided by either
  <code>dnsmasq</code> or Windows.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Although it makes sense
  for them both to have the same netmask, there's no reason why this has to be
  the case.</p>
