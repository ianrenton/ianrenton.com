  <p>That shouldn't matter -- if you can ping the RPi over Wifi, then routing
  (including gateways) isn't your problem.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you don't have
  <code>lsof</code>, you can install it from your distro's repositories using
  something like <code>sudo apt-get install lsof</code>, or manually if
  necessary. However, if you don't have any way of running this command while
  connected via SSH, it won't help us diagnose the issue.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Is
  there any chance of getting a monitor and keyboard connected to your Pi soon?
  I'm sorry to say that I'm running out of ideas here :(</p>
