  <p>Occidentalis may name things a little differently, I don't have the
  Raspberry Tank around at the moment so I can't check with a proper
  Occidentalis install -- all I have is a vanilla Debian
  box.</p><p></p><p></p><p><code>ssh.conf</code> sounds like config for the SSH

  <code>/etc/ssh/sshd.conf</code> or <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> (the "d"
  is the important bit that lets you know it's configuration for the
  <em>daemon</em> -- i.e. the server) then perhaps Occidentalis stores the file
  somewhere else. I will power up the tank when I get a chance and see if I can
  find it.</p>
