  <p>Now I am quite confused! Your Pi responds to ping but not to ssh, you're
  running ssh because you can use it via Ethernet, and you've made sure it's
  listening to connections from all addresses.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Can you
  attach a keyboard and monitor to the Pi while it's in the state where you
  can't ssh in, and from the keyboard, type:<br><pre>sudo lsof -i | grep
  ssh</pre><br>This will hopefully show an ssh server and the address it's
  listening on - could you comment here with the output of that command?</p>
