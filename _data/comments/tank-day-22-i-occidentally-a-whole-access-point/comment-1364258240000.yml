  <p>Do you have an SSH (or Telnet) server running on your Raspberry Pi?
  Depending on what operating system you are using, you may not have an SSH
  server running by default.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you're using the "Raspbian"
  distro, the easiest way to enable SSH is to insert the SD card into another
  computer. You should see two volumes -- one small "boot" volume and one larger
  "root" volume. Inside the "boot" volume there should be a file named
  <code>boot<em>enable</em>ssh.rc</code>. If you rename that to
  <code>boot.rc</code>, eject the SD card and put it back into your Pi, you
  should have an SSH server running whenever the Pi starts
  up.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you have a different operating system on your Pi,
  let me know and I'll see if I can work out the instructions for your
  particular OS.</p>
