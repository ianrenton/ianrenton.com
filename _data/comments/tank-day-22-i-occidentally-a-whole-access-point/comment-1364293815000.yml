  <p>If you're using the configuration above, your laptop should be assigned an
  IP address automatically using DHCP.  First of all, try going into your
  network settings in Windows 7 and making sure that your laptop has an IP
  address in the right range. Then, try pinging the RPi from the command line in
  Windows.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you can't ping the RPi, you probably have
  something wrong in your network configuration on the Pi. Try setting a static
  address on the laptop and see if that works.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you can
  ping the RPi, it's probably configured to only listen for SSH connections on
  the Ethernet port (for some reason). On your Pi, edit
  <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> and look for a line that should read
  <code>ListenAddress 0.0.0.0</code>. If there's something other than "0.0.0.0"
  in there, that might be your problem.</p>
