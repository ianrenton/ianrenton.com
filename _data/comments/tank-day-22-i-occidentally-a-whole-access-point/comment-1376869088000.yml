  <p>I use a very similar setup to yours. I use the RPi to provide an
  information station, a wireless local content server at events. No Internet is
  involved.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I have not had the issue you
  describe.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I see that the netmask you show in your
  network/interfaces and the network shown in your Windows connection
  illustration are different. The Windows one seems correct. Shouldn't the
  netmask for the address you specified be 255.255.255.0, not 255.255.0.0 as
  your file currently reads?</p><p></p><p></p><p>I also don't understand the
  idea of dnsmasq assigning the laptop an IP address. You have hard coded an
  address in network/interfaces, so the one you put there should stick.</p>
