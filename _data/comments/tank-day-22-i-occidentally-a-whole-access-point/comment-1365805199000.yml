  <p>I guess there's some configuration problem between hostapd and sshd, yes --
  but I'm sorry to say that I still have no idea what the problem is. I have
  tried to recreate the problem on my Pi but it works without a problem for
  me.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When I get a chance I will grab the
  <code>/etc/init.d/hostapd</code> and <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> from my
  tank so you and low yi liang can compare yours against what I have.</p>
