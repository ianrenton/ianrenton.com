  <p>I too have been forced to watch this show repeatedly, so have had some
  somwhat similar thoughts.  Ever read The Time Machine by H.G. Wells, or
  watched the episode of Doctor Who where they travel to the end of time and
  meet Derek Jacobi?  Right.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So Iggle Piggle floats on a
  dark, dead world, it's sun already extinguished.  Above him, stars flare and
  burn out, as the universe burns up the last of himself.  Poor Iggle Piggle had
  to do some terrible things to those he loved, but it was worth for those few
  extra days of survival.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Soon it's time to sleep, and be
  reunited with his loved ones in some other world.  Like the simple Eloi from
  Time Machine, they do not and cannot speak.  They simply look at him in mute
  judgement.  Always looking with their cold, dead eyes.  But what do the great,
  violent Hoo-Haas want?  And do the Morlocks truly lurk beneath the Gazebo?</p>
