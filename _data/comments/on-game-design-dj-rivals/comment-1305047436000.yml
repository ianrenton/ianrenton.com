  <p>Yeah, server load is probably fairly low.  Stamina as a mechanic exists
  solely as a hook to get players coming back to the game often, every few hours
  if they want to level up as quickly as possible.  Rather than just playing the
  game whenever you like, it tries to get players to come back (and thus view
  ads) much more often.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The later moves are more complex and
  thus more fun, the only issue is that they're the same regardless of the song
  you're playing them to (though their tempo changes appropriately).  In order
  to get variety, you have to deliberately choose different moves -- okay when
  you have three similarly powered ones, but if you have one particularly strong
  move you'll end up using it all the time.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I'd much rather
  be playing TWEWY than DJ Rivals, it's true. My copy has disappeared into the
  ether :S</p>
