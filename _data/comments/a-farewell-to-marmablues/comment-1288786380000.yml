  <p>98? Great balls of fire, it's 2010 and I wouldn't have the faintest idea
  how one goes about even buying a domain name, never mind building a whole
  website. GeoCities is dead now, right? Yeah, that's all my options
  exhausted.Ghastly neon animations and MIDI theme tunes would be something to
  which I can only aspire.Ah, the twentieth century. When a reasonable letter
  explaining your position actually produced a reasonable response (hell, the
  word 'letter' dates it more than anything else).I wish I could have seen it in
  all its blinking, 8-bit glory. In fact, I have this terrible urge to buy the
  domain and desecrate it in my own very special way, with all the inept hackery
  a first-time web designer can muster. It seems somehow appropriate.<em>Raises
