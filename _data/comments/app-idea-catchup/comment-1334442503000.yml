  <p>That's a pretty good idea -- weirdnesses in the geographical clustering
  algorithm, bad address-to-location mapping for events or high error on user
  location could all cause users to be placed outside the main chat room for an
  event, so a map and the ability to name events yourself on the fly would be
  very useful there.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As for how to prevent that, in this
  specific case I don't -- I'd like the app to exist, but if some other group
  nicks the idea and builds it themselves I don't really
  care.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the general case, most businesses produce and
  sign Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) to cover that eventuality. The company
  with the idea would produce an NDA and get the other company to sign it before
  they discuss the idea in any detail.  I'm not sure whether this would come
  across as too cocky if you're an individual trying to get a high street chain
  to sign up. There's a StackExchange site called <a 0=""

  your question may have been answered there (it's roughly on-topic) or if not,
  it can't hurt to ask.  If you do go ahead with an NDA, it's almost certainly
  worth getting a solicitor to draft it with you to ensure it's legally
  binding.</p>
