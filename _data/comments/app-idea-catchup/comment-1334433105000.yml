  <p>Really nice idea! You could have events also generated by the users.<br>Say
  someone turned up to a gig and they open the app. They're greeted by a local
  area map showing the locations of nearby chats that they're close enough to
  join (say a 0.5 mile radius?). If they don't see an applicable chat, they can
  begin a new one. Others then turn up later and join the already created one.
  Really cool!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Something totally aside. How do you stop
  someone from taking this wonderful idea and with much greater resources just
  developing it behind your back? The reason I ask is I had an idea for an app
  myself (albeit hardly as innovative as this!), and I want to pitch it to the
  company in question (a local high street chain) without them just saying, "no
  thank you", then making it behind my back without my input.</p>
