  <p>Yep - the app could allow an "enter your location" box if the user doesn't
  choose to enable location, but the idea was centred around having location
  available.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That said, how about introducing "not there"
  chat members as second-class citizens in chat?  That way, anyone could see
  what was being talked about in real time at a certain event, but users that
  are actually there can optionally restrict their view of the chat to only
  include people who are also there.</p>
