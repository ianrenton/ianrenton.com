  <p>Hi Ian<br>We own a flat near Gravesend which we let to tenants. I have
  tried to get recycling on the agenda, so far without success. The managing
  agents for the block say that when they speak to council staff, they secretly
  admit that it is almost impossible to recycle at apartment blocks, because if
  only one item that is non-recyclable is put in the recycling bin, the whole
  bin is regarded as contaminated and they take it as general waste.<br>I live
  in the Vale of Glamorgan. All our recyclable waste is collected from Blue bags
  (we don't need to segregate) and transported to Cardiff,  where it is manually
  separated. Why can't councils nationally follow best practice in different
  parts of the country?<br>Cheers Phil Tandy</p>
