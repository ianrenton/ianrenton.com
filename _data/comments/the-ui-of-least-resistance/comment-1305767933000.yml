  <p>At the moment you don't even need to uninstall Unity - you can pick "Ubuntu
  Classic Session" or something like that from GDM, and it'll drop you into
  GNOME a la 10.10.  I've no idea if they intend to maintain that though (and as
  an XFCE user, it doesn't affect me anyway).</p><p></p><p></p><p>I've played
  with Chrome a bit and always come back to Firefox, though I do miss the tab
  handling -- particularly the "tabs don't resize immediately when others are
  closed" behaviour.  I may have to see if there's a plugin for that :)</p>
