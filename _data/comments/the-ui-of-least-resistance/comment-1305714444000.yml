  <p>I really love the concept of Unity, the idea that they've struck out in a
  bold new direction. I'm having a similar issue with browsers at the moment. I
  moved from firefox over to chrome so long ago I've forgotten doing it, but the
  new firefox is apparently really good. I've tried to switch over a fair few
  times but I keep going back to chrome just because I don't want to teach
  myself a new UI.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ubuntu have set themselves up a nice
  safety net by having 10.4 a Long-term Support release, so if you don't like it
  there are still options.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Though there is one really good
  thing about the Unity interface, you can uninstal it. I love Avant Window
  Navigator, bit previously there was no easy way to remove the panels from the
  standard UI, so I ended up shrinking the last one down and autohiding it. With
  Unity removed my screen can be a nice blank canvas to add on AWN, Gnome-do and
  Yakuake without having any leftover UI elements.</p>
