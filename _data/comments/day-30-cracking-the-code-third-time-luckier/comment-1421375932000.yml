  <p>I'm afraid not â€” to be honest, most of the stuff I've written about in this
  guide is now pretty old and the techniques to get stuff up and running have
  changed.  For example, Raspbian comes with I2C drivers these days so you don't
  need Occidentalis, my WiFi access point setup was a bit dodgy, there's an
  official Raspberry Pi camera to take the place of the webcam I used,
  etc.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you want to recreate what I've done, I'd suggest
  following <a
  href="http://sirlagz.net/2012/08/09/how-to-use-the-raspberry-pi-as-a-wireless-access-pointrouter-part-1/"
  rel="nofollow noopener">this guide for Access Point setup</a> and <a
  href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-build-and-run-mjpg-streamer-on-the-raspberry-pi"
  rel="nofollow noopener">this guide for
  mjpg-streamer</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I think the complete set of system
  packages I've installed to make my stuff work is: <code>build-essential cmake
  libi2c-dev i2ctools lighttpd git subversion libjpeg8-dev imagemagick
  libv4l-dev hostapd dnsmasq</code>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>After all that stuff is
  set up, grab my code from Github. <a
  href="https://github.com/ianrenton/raspberrytank/tree/master/web-ui"
  rel="nofollow noopener">This stuff</a> goes in <code>/var/www/</code> where
  lighttpd will serve it, then <a
  href="https://github.com/ianrenton/raspberrytank/tree/master/rt_http"
  rel="nofollow noopener">this stuff</a> goes wherever you want it, e.g.
  <code>/home/pi/rt_http/</code>, and build it from there by simply running
  <code>make</code>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Last of all, you want to create some
  init scripts to run <code>rt_http</code> and <code>mjpg-streamer</code> on
  startup. I don't think I ever uploaded the init script for
  <code>rt_http</code>, but it's pretty much identical to the one I posted for
  <code>mjpg-streamer</code> in "Step 4" of <a
  href="http://robots.ianrenton.com/day-14-video-streaming" rel="nofollow
  noopener">this page</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you get stuck, let me know and
  I'll do my best to answer your questions!</p>
