  <p>Yes, it's like that for me too. Do you also find that once reversing, you
  have to go forward slightly before it will stop? (If you go from reverse to no
  demands, it keeps reversing?) I haven't found a solution to these yet â€” I
  really need to knock up a better way of testing combinations of bits 2-6 and
  13-16 so we can figure out how the main motor speeds work properly, rather
  than just guessing codes.</p>
