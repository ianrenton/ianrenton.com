  <p>Google Analytics suggests we run at around 30 users per day, but it's
  pretty difficult to judge how many files are served to them, as only index.php
  has the Analytics code -- I don't get to see how many times column.php is
  requested, for example. (And for the sake of speed, it probably ought to stay
  that way.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>Analytics suggests users spend on average 12
  minutes per session on the site (no idea how it calculates that), but each
  user may have multiple sessions over the course of the
  day.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It gets more complicated still, because not every
  column causes equal load -- a Twitter Home Timeline column is much easier to
  crunch data for than my "Mentions & Notifications" column for my five accounts
  :)</p><p></p><p></p><p>I think I'd have to add some custom analytics code
  within SuccessWhale to get exactly the stats we're interested in. And you're
  right, it could well be Stack Exchange material.</p>
