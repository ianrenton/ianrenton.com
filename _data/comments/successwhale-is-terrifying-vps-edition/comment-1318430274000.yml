  <p>That's the tricky thing with shared hosting, there <em>is</em> no hard
  limit on memory use.  Individual processes are killed if they use too much,
  but the limit is a factor of not only what else you have running (e.g. other
  PHP scripts) but also what the other people hosting on that server are
  using.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It's particularly frustrating as there's no way to
  gauge how responsive a website will be in the long run.  As a case in point,
  when I wrote this post, SW and Only Dreaming were really suffering with around
  50% of requests timing out or failing at peak times.  Today, it's much better,
  and I'm not noticing any changes in my own stats.  That probably means it's
  load on <em>someone else's</em> site contributing to my problems.</p>
