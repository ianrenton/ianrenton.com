  <p>I have the same issue with different groups of people on Facebookâ€”I've
  ended up going back to more of the "old Livejournal view" by normally looking
  at a custom list of just you lot, and normally posting things that are only
  visible to that group as well. A lot of the people I know from work don't use
  Facebook anyway, or use it pretty sparingly, so I don't think I'm missing
  much!</p><p></p><p></p><p>FWIW I do have a mini keyboard that I briefly used
  on the train, but I gave up on it pretty quick. I prefer to use my tablet for
  portable writing stuff, but even then it sits behind the sofa and rarely
  leaves the house.</p>
