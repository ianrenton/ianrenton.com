  <p>I mentally wrote a massive reply to this weeks ago and just realised I
  totally forgot to actually write it down :S</p><p></p><p></p><p>The biggest
  problem I have with sharing stuff online is the audience. By trying to be "one
  tool for everything" Facebook brought a combination of friends, family, old
  friends and people I vaugely met in the pub once all together in one place. On
  Livejournal it was just you lot. Now I tend to play it safe and keep the
  overly personal stuff out of the way. Add the dilemma that new friends tend to
  also be work colleages and then I've got a whole audience I have no idea how
  to integrate in. As a consultant the "work colleagues" chop and change
  constantly, a combination of good friends, client staff, people you sorta met
  once, people you get on really well with. I actually have very few people from
  work on social media because of that. It kinda sucks a bit really; I struggle
  to stay in touch with people I've met in the last 3 years-ish, and I'm not
  sure what I want to share with them either, which in turn waters down the
  content that older good friends get.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I'm also guarding
  older content that I don't nessasarily want work people I barely know to find,
  preventing me from linking to one account from another. I've gotta be honest,
  the "use your real name online" generation are going to have hell when they
  get to our age.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Also my life is pretty boring
  :)</p><p></p><p></p><p>The other problem is Smartphones. I've gotten so used
  to the "say it when you think it" aspect of social media I don't make the time
  later to write stuff up properly. I've been meaning to overhaul my blog for
  years and figure out exactly <em>what</em> it is. I've mentally written so
  many blog posts that never actually made it to the keyboard (including this
  comment, come to think of it). I miss it. Maybe I should get a mini keyboard
  for the train...</p><p></p><p></p><p>Slightly unrelated: luckily for me the
  "wall of toddler photos" was coming from ancient people I barely knew from
  school so bam, that got hidden. Life online has been much improved now I only
  get baby photos from people I actually care about.</p>
