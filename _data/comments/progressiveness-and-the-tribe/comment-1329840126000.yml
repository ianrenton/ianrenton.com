  <p>As an individual citizen you can not only write to your mp, but also lobby
  them, if you are willing to either go to a session with them in your
  constituency or go to the houses of parliament, where you are (I believe)
  allowed to turn up and chat to them in the lobby.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Pressure
  groups do this all the time, and are one of the most effective ways for an
  individual to make a difference. So if I was greatly concerned about human
  rights, I'd join Liberty, and as a group my voice would be much louder on
  issues I care about. Thats what pressure groups exist to do, and they do prove
  effective, because blocks of votes are important for politicians to win. That
  said, they'd be more important with a fairer voting system, but c'est la
  vie.</p>
