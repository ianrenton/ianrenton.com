  <p>This would explain why I keep hearing a fucking buzzing around Manchester

  loitering is a by product of one thing... most youngsters nowadays outside of
  school have nothing to do. People don't want them outside, so they're kept
  from meeting in fields. Many cities don't have parks any more, so that's out
  of the question. I don't think schools have encouraged after school activities
  in a long time, apart from football once a week. So what the fuck else are
  they supposed to do?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Bizarrely the least hoodie ridden

  the kids of the area something to do with playing fields and a youth

  of prison is to stop crimes happening. Given reoffending rates for youth crime
  sticking people in prison with no alternative to isn't likely to solve squat.
  If it did the rates wouldn't be so high. Teach a bugger somehow they can make
  a living however and chances are the rate of reoffense would be lower, as I
  believe has been proven successful in the Netherlands and Scandanavia. It may
  not be philosophically fulfilling but is somewhat more likely to work.</p>
