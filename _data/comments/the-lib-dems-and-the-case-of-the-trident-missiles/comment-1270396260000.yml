  <p>@Frankie: The article you link to stops notably short of saying we need US
  approval to use the missiles, which we don't: <a

  true that we developed them together with the US, and our missiles and theirs
  share common components.  I have no idea if we rent our Tridents from America
  - it's quite possible, with the round-about way these things work, but doesn't
  mean they have any influence over their use.And for all that article's mention
  of the InterOperability programme, it very definitely does not mean the US has
  the ability to launch our missiles or us theirs.</p>
