  <p>Not sure. I haven't been carrying the DHD around with me for the last week,
  to force myself to use the BlackBerry, but I may start carrying it again. 
  Swapping the SIM card is an issue though (since you can't have two SIMs on a
  single contract with Vodafone) - so far, the effort of swapping SIMs has kept
  me doing things on the BB that would be easier on the
  DHD.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Next contract upgrade time, I might look specifically
  for Android phones with keyboards and good battery life -- but so far, I've
  never seen an Android phone praised for its battery.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I'm
  still trying to avoid iPhones on the grounds that my choice of phone shouldn't
  determine my desktop OS :)</p>
