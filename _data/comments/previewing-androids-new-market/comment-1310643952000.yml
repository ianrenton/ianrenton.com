  <p>I wonder why they chose the Window's interface to draw inspiration from. It
  certainly looks more colourful and 'exciting' but I'm not sure that that's
  what the android brand is all about. To me, it seems like a gimmick, but I
  haven't used it much. I imagine it tested well or they wouldn't have gone
  ahead with it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I still prefer it to the iPhone
