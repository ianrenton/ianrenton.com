  <p>For me, I think Apple's App Store has the edge in terms of
  simple-but-attractive design (at least on iPhone/iPod, I haven't tried it on
  an iPad).  The old Android Market was getting there, though it had a few rough
  edges, while the new Market excels in appearance but throws away most of the
  simplicity it used to have.</p>
