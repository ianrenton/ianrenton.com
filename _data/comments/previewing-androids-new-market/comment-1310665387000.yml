  <p>Simplicity is the key for me. I don't have a huge desire style phone I
  still have the relatively smaller screen and filling it up with (ok pretty)
  graphics seems to go the wrong way for me as all I want to do is find the
  right app for me then install it. the presentation should really be logical,
  clean and fast rather than pretty and cluttered.</p>
