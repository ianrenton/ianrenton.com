  <p>I've only seen this version of the market on HDPI (480x800-ish) devices,
  not MDPI (320x480) or LDPI (240x320), so the interface might be different on
  those devices.  Certainly the font used on the tabs ("principales novedades
  gratuitas" etc.) and the scrolling screenshot area don't look like they'd look
  good at a lower res, so maybe they're different on platforms with lower-res
  screens.  Or, in that annoying Googly way, the new market app might just not
  be rolled out to those devices, splitting the ecosystem again :S</p>
