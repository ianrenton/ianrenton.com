  <p>Interaction with others seems casual and optional. I've discovered very few
  multiplayer quests, and those I've found tend to be extremely simple ("dig a
  hole with two other people", etc.).  The skill tree is also fairly wide and
  flat, meaning that there's very little "I'm a cook, you're a miner, let's pool
  our skills to make some high-level item" potential -- after a few weeks of
  play, a character will have a reasonable level of skill at just about
  everything.  So yes, I'm afraid other characters are largely interactive
  scenery that occasionally use the auction house.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I
  intended to play Echo Bazaar right up until the point I blocked it.  It didn't
  seem possible to play without giving it access to my Twitter account, and
  knowing how annoyed I was by other people's posts, I decided not to inflict
  the same on others :)</p>
