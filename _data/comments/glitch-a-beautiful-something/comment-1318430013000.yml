  <p>I think browser/flash is probably the <em>most</em> sensible platform to
  develop games for (possibly second to iOS) at the moment, regardless of
  whether there's deep player interaction or not.  The installed base of Flash
  is huge, there's hardly any minimum requirements to run and nothing to
  download.  This ease-of-entry, combined with a micropayment rather than
  subscription business model, has got to be one of the reasons that the likes
  of FarmVille have 3-4 times the user base of Warcraft.  On the programming
  side, there's no advanced graphics libraries to learn and no hardware support
  to consider.  Unless you're after the depth of game that only a big
  development team and an installation DVD can give you, Flash looks to me like
  a reasonable choice.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I didn't realise tweeting from EB was
  optional, I might play with that at some point then.  I have no particular
  desire to explore at any particular rate, so I'll just avoid tweeting from it
  altogether.</p>
