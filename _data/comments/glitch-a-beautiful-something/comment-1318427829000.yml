  <p>Ah. I'll probably pass then. What keeps frustrating me with EB is the lack
  of inter-player interaction (and the lack of people I know on there to
  interact with). It's a hard problem, I'm sure (every year or so Tom and I get
  excited and swap emails on browser based game design and then give up
  pre-protoype)  but a browser / flash seems like a silly platform to develop a
  game for unless there's a pro like deep player interaction that you don't get
  elsewhere.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hmm. EB uses Twitter / FB instead of having its
  own login mechanism and offers extra "energy" for tweeting little text
  snippets about the game setting. But<br>a) You don't have to tweet those
  snippets, and you don't lose out on anything if you don't - as it's not a
  competition, not having as much energy / day simply means you don't explore
  the world quite as quickly.<br>b) The snippets are editable. Once I realised
  it annoyed people, I stuck an @echobazaar on the beginning of each tweet,
  which should have limited it to people also following the EB account - who
  hopefully also had an interest in the game. :)</p>
