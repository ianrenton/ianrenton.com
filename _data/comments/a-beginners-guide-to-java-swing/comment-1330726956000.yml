  <p>BoxLayout is my go-to for swing. Don't touch the others with a barge pole,
  unless you want something really simple, then go for FlowLayout until it
  breaks.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A lot of them seem to assume that they can ask for
  a size up front and then not recalibrate if you grow the size of a component
  later.<br>Also, see Box.createHorizontalGlue() and Box.createVerticalGlue() to
  make BoxLayout sit down and shut up</p>
