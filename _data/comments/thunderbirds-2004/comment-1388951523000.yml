  <p>I have since checked what became of Gerry Anderson. Turns out he died of
  Alzheimer's on Boxing Day, 2012, and his body was cremated. At the time this
  film was made, he refused to take part. Sylvia Anderson, however, happily took
  on a consulting role. So perhaps the first number point is not entirely
  accurate.</p>
