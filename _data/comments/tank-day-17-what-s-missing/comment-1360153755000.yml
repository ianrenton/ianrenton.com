  <p>Hello Ian,<br>first of all - thank you very much for this very inspiring
  and interesting project in your blog/site.<br>It caused me to buy a Raspberry
  Pi (and prior an Arduino) ~ 2 months ago. Currently I am in the "phase" of
  testing and getting the parts for my "autonomous-raspi-tank"-project. Thanks
  to your blog I got confirmation that nearly everything is possible with
  Raspberri Pi. Hopefully once I will be able to provide any near informational
  site like yours and try currently to document my project (-progress) on my
  site. I am looking forward to see new inspirations on your blog especially
  regarding "Autonomy"-part / interacting with sensors.<br>Thank you again and
  regards from Dublin,<br>Henning</p>
