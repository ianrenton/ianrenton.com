  <p>Hello Ian,<br>Thanks very much for sharing your Raspberry Pi Tank build, I
  enjoyed reading it very much. I've also been working on a project for the past
  while (<a href="http://clikire.snappages.com/farmboz-3.htm" rel="nofollow
  noopener">http://clikire.snappages.com/farmboz-3.htm</a>). and I'm hoping to
  get it connected to the internet in the near future using 3G Wireless
  Broadband Dongle/WiFi and a Raspberry Pi. I'm sure a lot of what you have done
  will come in  very useful.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Many Thanks,<br>Niall</p>
