  <p>Greetings Ian,<br>this is a very inspiring project for me! I follow it
  closely, since it has so many solutions for lots of interesting tasks.<br>I
  would also like to make a suggestion for future plans and that is to have the
  tank go recharge itself when the battery is low. Basically when the navigation
  is reliable enough, the tank would know its position and how to return to the
  charging station, where it would manoeuvre to a charging position. That way
  you could have a truly autonomous entity monitoring the
  house.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hope to see it in the future :) Good
  luck!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Maks</p>
