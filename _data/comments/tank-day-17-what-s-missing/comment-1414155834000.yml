  <p>Hi,</p><p></p><p></p><p>Instead of click and hold, it is pretty popular to
  have buttons toggled. Tap will toggle and hold ON, re tap will toggle
  off.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There needs to be some kind of logical chekcing here,
  because you dont want the user to top forward and back to be on the same time.
  But you want possibly to go forward left, while turning the turret. And while
  going forward left you can simply switch to forward right? (I assume you can
  go forward and turn, I have not seen any video of you where the tank does
  this)</p><p></p><p></p><p>Any way , If I expected an interface like where I
  can control so many things, I would let my tank go lock my tank to go forward,
  while controlling the turrets. That is like 4 fingers holding a buttons. Not
  great on small phones.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Also have a clear all button. To
  stop the tank in case of emergency or getting confused.</p>
