  <p>A good argument and, although there are some days when I would love to see
  the total collapse of all society purely for the interests in seeing wht would
  come next, I agree that improvement is the way
  forward.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The big thing that I think a lot of the people
  that are driving for the small society life forget, wihch I'll adit to losing
  in the romanticism sometimes myself, is that small scale farming, especially
  on an individual family level, is quite innefficient.  A large farm of people
  dedicated to the production of food is far more capable of producing the food
  to feed everyone.  Admittedly we probably should try harder to eat the food
  that is more locally produced, reducing excess shipping and support local
  communities are still important, but farms that serve a large number of people
  are still the way forward.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The problem I believe we have
  with moving forward though is that of conviction.  The things our society
  could be capable of, the places we could be are fantastic when you think about
  them.  Now look at where we are.  It an overused example, but in terms of
  space exploration 2001: A Space Odessey was bang on the money for it's time
  for where we should be when the time rolled round.  Now ten years after the
  date and we still haven't put people back on the moon.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As
  the human population expands as well we will find ourselves increasingly
  having to find better ways to get the resources for all the people which
  ultimately falls down to arguments of whether we can afford expansionism or
  not.  Personally I believe that we can, in a small amount through a
  re-awakening of some of the colonialist ideas.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Obviously
  there are very few places on earth that we take colonialism to now and the
  methods in which colonialism was used in the past were questionable at best. 
  There are however avenues available to us now for expansion, for new resources
  and new frontiers, that just didn't exist in the past.  We have the technology
  now to start to exploit our oceans in an intelligent and safe manner (not BP
  style I hasen to add, but in the style once promoted as part of the future by
  Cousteau himself) and to expand beyond our little rock of home
  entirely.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can see examples throughout history that the
  society which is top dog is that which has most recently driven to expand
  itself and to better exploit new resources.  It was the Britsh Empire with
  half the globe at it's beck and call.  Then the US started to expand and
  better exploit it's own resources.  Most recently China has come to the fore
  as its started to realise the massive resources available to it for leverage
  on a global stage.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The last hundred and fifty years or so
  showed the fastest changes that I believe our societal structure and
  technological prowess have ever seen and now Stagnation is our biggest
  threat.  The more we stagnate, the bigger I believe our cracks will be and the
  bigger the patches we will need for them.  Perhaps we need a big crack to give
  us the courage to progress?</p>
