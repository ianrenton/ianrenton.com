  <p>Well said. For better or worse the variety of activities in the world is
  increasing, and has done so for a significant period of time. Small
  communities simply don't work for a technological society (see the history of
  international trade and knowledge transfer even a thousand years ago). And I
  like it. Although its fairly important to learn something about everything,
  even if it doesn't interest you. Broadens the brain.</p>
