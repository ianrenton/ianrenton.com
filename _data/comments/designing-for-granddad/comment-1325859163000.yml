  <p>I am not sure that what you want should exist in a single UI. Trying to
  create a UI that can be used by /everyone/ is probability not going to
  work.<br>I really hate it when people create UIs with buttons marked
  'advanced' - it just means 'I do not know where to put this'. instead perhaps
  more apps should have several user modes that group together levels of
  functionality?<br>At the last BarCamp i was at someone made a very good point
  that software should be like a musical instrument - possible to master. we we
  generally get the days though is 'one size does not quite fit anyone'.</p>
