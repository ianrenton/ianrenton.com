  <p>I'm not really sure why I like to be asked before applications on my PC
  connect to the internet -- I have no problem with push messages on my phone,
  so I seem to be a bit inconsistent! :)  I guess it's just that if I'm actually
  using the computer, it seems courteous for software to ask "is it actually
  okay if I saturate your bandwidth and CPU for a couple of minutes?" rather
  than just doing it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I'm not convinced a voice UI would
  catch on -- most people feel pretty silly talking to a device, even when it's
  sort-of conversational like Apple's Siri.  And with no human "warmth" to the
  conversation, I think people would get even <em>more</em> annoyed at it
  interrupting! :)</p>
