  <p>Yeah, I like your idea of configurable level of control and complexity.  It
  almost needs to be an OS level setting, like Parental Controls are on games
  consoles. Then you go to Control Panel and set up grandad's PC on 'smooth'
  interaction setting, and applications are encouraged to adhere to this
  setting.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Why do you like to be asked before your
  anti-virus accesses the Internet? Even as an experienced user, I get narked
  off at applications continually checking if it's alright that they update
  themselves. Almost invariably I say yes. And popping up to tell me it's done.
  Just go away! Updating is one of those things that, as long as it's free,
  users really don't need to know or care about.  Chrome does it right. That's
  constantly updated, but I never hear about it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The
  "interrupting them" point is interesting. With a human-to-human interaction
  most people would deal with it. At a restaurant, you'd expect the waiting
  staff to confirm your food selection, suggest an alternative wine and ask how
  rare you'd like your steak. But for some reason people are more dismissive of
  computers, when in fact they <em>need</em> more
  clarification!</p><p></p><p></p><p>I just wonder if the HCI were different (if
  a voice said "excuse me Ian, your anti-virus is about to connect to the
  Internet to get updates, please say 'No' if you want to stop it"), would
  people engage more?</p>
