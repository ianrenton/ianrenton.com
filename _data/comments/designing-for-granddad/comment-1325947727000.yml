  <p>Regarding touchscreens, they are better at providing simplified interfaces
  as all the components need to be finger-size, though there are trade-offs --
  on-screen keyboards that are much harder to use than real hardware, for
  example.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The problem of different users (for example the
  user giving and the user receiving tech support) I think is mostly mitigated
  by being able to easily switch from one to the
  other.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You're definitely right about inconsistency and
  pop-ups though -- anything unexpected on the display can cause confusion and
  often an immediate phone call! :)  I've had quite a few calls of the
  form:<br><blockquote>Father-in-law: My computer's not working!<br/>Me/Eric:
  What's wrong with it, is it not turning on?<br/>FiL: No, there's a box that
  comes up.<br/>I/E: What does it say?<br/>FiL: "Your virus definitions are out
  of date, click here to resolve the problem."<br/>I/E: Have you tried clicking
  it?<br/>FiL: No. (clicks)<br/>I/E: Is it updating your antivirus now?<br/>FiL:
  Yes, it works now.</blockquote></p><p></p><p></p><p>After some of the people I
  work with, I'm not too surprised anymore when I encounter a programmer who
  can't use a smartphone.  Hell, there's at least one programmer there who
  doesn't have a home computer!  It's a case of UI paradigm recognition, I think
  -- touchscreen smartphones have only become mainstream in the last five years,
  so their interactions (swipe, pinch to zoom) are still not as embedded in
  everyone's mind as the 30-year-old point and click.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I've
  not investigated smartphone manuals in a long time -- my last few phones have
  come with a tiny quick start booklet and a proper manual on PDF on the phone's
  microSD card.  Unfortunately, accessing the manual seems to require the user
  to already know how to mount the phone in USB Mass Storage mode and find files
  on it using their desktop OS.  Not very helpful for the complete beginner!</p>
