  <p>Very much agreed.  I'm sure there are some apps that have such limited
  functionality that a simple UI could cover all users, but most -- Word,
  Facebook, etc. -- have such a wide range of functionality that a simplified
  GUI would not suit all users.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I would love more software
  to have multiple modes to cover widely different users.  The briefly-trialled
  "Facebook Lite" interface would have been better for people like my granddad
  -- no apps, no games, no live feeds, just a simple chronological list of
  status updates.  So long as the app offers an easy "upgrade" path for users
  who have moved beyond the functionality of the simple interface, and an easy
  "downgrade" path if the full thing is scary, I can't see the harm.  (But of
  course, it does add extra development effort.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>This also

  rel="nofollow">The Myth of the Sophisticated User</a> -- a provocative title,
  but the point it's making is that sometimes the experienced user wants a
  simple interface too.</p>
