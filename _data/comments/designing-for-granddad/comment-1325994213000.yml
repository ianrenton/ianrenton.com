  <p>In the case of popups, I think it would improve the experience for novice
  users if applications could have a configurable level of notification tied
  into the configurable UI complexity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In my antivirus
  example, for instance, as an advanced user I'd like to be asked first before
  it goes and accesses something via the internet.  But my father-in-law doesn't
  care, he just wants a virus-free computer with no interaction on his part, so
  there I think "update without prompting the user" is a reasonable
  behaviour.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The problem is, no matter how many times you
  ask them to, a lot of the time people <em>won't</em> just pause for thought,
  they'll either dismiss the popup out of hand (the computer is, after all,
  being rude in interrupting them) or assume that the computer doing something
  they didn't expect means that they did something the computer didn't expect --
  i.e. they've Done Something Wrong.</p>
