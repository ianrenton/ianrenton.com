  <p>The thing is, it is getting better. Touchscreen interfaces have forced a
  lot of funtionality out, bringing in big clear buttons to press. It's a pain
  in the arse for us, losing so much screen real estate to chunky buttons, but
  it's the kind of thing the basic user needs. You might be onto something with
  the different interfaces for different levels idea but this isn't new; I
  remember a version of Nero which launched with a basic interface and the
  option to change it into "I know what I'm doing" mode. Maybe we lost the idea
  along the way somewhere. But then again putting different users on different
  interfaces causes problems when using someone else's PC, or when a user on the
  advanced interface is called upon for tech support by someone on the basic
  one; all the options are in different places, some are missing altogether, and
  watching someone who should know what they're doing rooting through menus
  doesn't fill the less technical user with confidence.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I'm
  pretty familiar with this kind of stuff, I know quite a few people who aren't
  all that great with technology. Those things that are a little different every
  time you turn the PC on are a nightmare to less confident users. Sometimes the
  startup programs launch in a different order, meaning the icons in the system
  tray never quite look the same. We wouldn't care about that, but to someone
  who relies on familiarity it's very offputting.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Popup
  windows are the worst. There's no manual for a computer, so when something
  unexpected happens how do you know if it was supposed to, or if you broke it?
  Usually connected to available updates, to us it seems easy as anything to
  decide between ok or later, but to people who don't understand what it's
  trying to do it's just plain confusing. Flash player decides to update just
  after Windows loads... what is Flash player? Someone at work just panics and
  clicks the "close dialog" box every time she opens Firefox and sees its update
  available window, I dread to think what version she's
  running.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The surprising one was the computer programmer
  who, getting his first mobile phone a few years back, struggled to figure out
  how to use it. Think about it; every mobile phone works in a similar, yet
  slightly different way. But the manuals all assume you've owned a handset
  before. So for a complete beginner picking up their first handset in 2008,
  there's very little instruction there. He has an Android phone now so there
  was a happy ending to this one, but when someone you wouldn't think of as
  being technologically challenged struggles with a common device it really
  makes you think.</p>
