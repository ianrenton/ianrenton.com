  <p>8-10% CPU on an Intel Core 2 Duo (2.66GHz), Win XP.Easiest way to win is
  fill the build que, take the first ship and park it to the side of their base,
  in rage to shoot IT but not in range of the guns of the enemy's created
  ships.  AI doesn't bother attacking it and the massed firepower of a few ships
  stacked at your base destroys incoming without loss.</p>
