  <p>Thanks!I suspect that AI issue is because each individual ship that the
  enemy produces considers yours to be a bit too scary to take on its own, so it
  just rushes for your base.  There's a lot of work still to do on the AI, for
  example ships don't yet consider that they can gang up on more powerful
  enemies.</p>
