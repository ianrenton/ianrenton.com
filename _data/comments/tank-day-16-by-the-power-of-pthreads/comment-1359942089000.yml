  <p>I'm sure it's possible, but if you want to run your vision processing on
  the machine that has the webcam, it's a little redundant since your C++ could
  just talk straight to the webcam.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Either way, it's a
  pretty standard format (either MJPEG if you're using the stream or uvcvideo if
  you're talking direct) so you should be able to grab a library that supports
  what you want. If you're using OpenCV for your processing, I believe it
  already supports both of these.</p>
