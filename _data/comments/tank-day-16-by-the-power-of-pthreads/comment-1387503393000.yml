  <p>GeekRPI, building <code>mongoose</code> from the RaspberryTank repository
  is very easy, because it happens automatically as part of the
  <code>rt_http</code> makefile. So all you have to do
  is:</p><p></p><p></p><p><code><br>cd rt_http &&
  make<br></code></p><p></p><p></p><p>...and Mongoose will be compiled alongside
  the Raspberry Tank code itself.</p><p></p><p></p><p>However, if you're
  interested in PHP and CGI, the Mongoose server embedded in my code may not be
  the ideal solution for you. I'm not using it to serve files on diskâ€”rather,
  I'm handling the queries internally in my code, and using it to drive the
  tank. My tank uses a separate <code>lighttp</code> server to serve the static
  pages of the web interface, because I can't get Mongoose serving both pages
  from disk <em>and</em> handling certain queries in my own code at the same
  time.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you are interested in PHP via CGI in Mongoose,
  it's supposed to be possible, although I've not tried it myself. <a

  rel="nofollow noopener">This StackOverflow question</a> is about running it on
  Windows, but similar things should be possible in
  Linux.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you want a setup similar to mine, I recommend
  having both <code>lighttpd</code> and Mongoose running side by side. It's not
  a great solution, but until it's possible to get Mongoose to do both internal
  query handling <em>and</em> serving static files from disk, it's the best we
  have.</p>
