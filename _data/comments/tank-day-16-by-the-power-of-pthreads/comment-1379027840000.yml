  <p>Installing lighttpd is very easy, if your RPi can be connected to the
  internet. If you are using a Debian-derived system like me, simply
  run</p><p></p><p></p><p><code><br>sudo apt-get install
  lighttpd<br></code></p><p></p><p></p><p>This will download, install and run
  the web server, and make sure it runs every time the RPi starts
  up.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As I mentioned in a previous comment, the "web root"
  for lighttpd is <code>/var/www</code>. This means that you want to place the
  web pages that control the tank in there, and that will let you access them
  via a web browser.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For example, if you place a file at
  <code>/var/www/index.html</code> on your Pi, you can then access that via a
  web browser by entering <code>http://<ip address of
  rpi>/index.html</code>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I hope that helps, let me know if
  you need more information.</p>
