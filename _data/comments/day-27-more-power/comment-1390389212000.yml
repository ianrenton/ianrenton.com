  <p>I know there's a 1:24 scale version as well as my 1:16, so I guess you have
  that? I'm not sure how much space the 1:24 has inside, but hopefully you'll be
  OKâ€”there's plenty spare in mine really, I just haven't used it
  efficiently!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Taking out all the original electronics and
  doing your own motors / speed control is definitely not a bad plan, and I'd
  like to do that eventually in my tank too, I just haven't got around to it
  yet! My method of reverse-engineering the control codes (as you may have seen
  on this blog) was an "easy" way to get control, but it leaves you stuck with
  doing what the RX18 board will let you do. As you say, redoing the electronics
  yourself will give you proper speed control of the motors, which will result
  in much easier control.</p>
