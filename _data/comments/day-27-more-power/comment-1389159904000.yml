  <p>Hello. I have also really liked reading through your posts. so much so I
  have started my own project. although this is my first pi project.(I like to
  jump in at the deep end.) My problem is I ordered the tank before looking and
  dimensions, meaning mine tank is not as big as yours. so thinking a head I may
  have to rip all the internal wiring out and run all the motors and servos
  through a PWM controller which I think would offer me speed
  control.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My question is do you think it would work trying
  it this way? if so would yours work running it this
  way?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Thanks Joe</p>
