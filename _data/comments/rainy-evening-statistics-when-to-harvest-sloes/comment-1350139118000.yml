  <p>Further analysis of the sloe plant showed perhaps 500-600 accessible sloes,
  setting [latex]N = 2[/latex].  Also (while it seems kind of unfair to adjust
  the equation <em>after</em> the harvest), of all the 20 or so passers-by while
  I was harvesting, only one old lady paid me any attention and even she didn't
  recognise the fruit as sloes until I told her -- so I am inclined to reduce
  [latex]f_n[/latex] still further to around 0.005.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This
  would result in returning the harvest probability per day, [latex]P_h =
  {[}0.1, 0.25{]}[/latex], though with two accessible harvests' worth of sloes,
  I would have twice as long on average to grab my share.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Of
  course, it's all somewhat academic now as I have a box full of sloes in my
  freezer.  I have become a statistic!</p>
