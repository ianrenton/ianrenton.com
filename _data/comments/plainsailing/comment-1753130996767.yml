message: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nI'm not too familiar with the LoRa side of things, but if you have a radio system where you can put bytes in one end and get them out of the other, you should be able to get up and running using AIS Catcher. Something like [RadioLib](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib) might be what you need, depending on the LoRa devices you have, or you could piggyback on networks such as Meshtastic, MeshCore, or LoRaWAN.\r\n\r\nAIS Catcher supports multiple inputs and multiple outputs, and crucially, NMEA-0183 can be both an input and an output format.\r\n\r\nSo for example, at a remote site, you could have a Pi Zero 2 with an RTL-SDR receiving the AIS transmissions, AIS Catcher decoding them and outputting NMEA-0183, then a LoRa board sending the NMEA data out over LoRA. Then at the receiving end, another LoRa board receives those transmissions and rebuilds the NMEA-0183 messages, passes them to another instance of AIS Catcher or to Plane/Sailing, to MarineTraffic.com etc.\r\n\r\nDepending on power availability at the receive sites, you may want to consider other options too - a Pi Zero + RTL-SDR might be too power-hungry for solar.\r\n\r\n[This](https://github.com/pdgilbert/LoRaGPS) might be useful as well, though it looks like it's receiving GPS data and constructing fake AIS data. You could strip out the construction of fake AIS data on the receive end, and send actual AIS data from the sensor units. GPS messages are typically in NMEA-0183 the same as AIS, so you could probably adapt this to do the LoRa side of things.\r\n\r\nIt certainly sounds like an interesting project!"
