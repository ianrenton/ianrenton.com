message: "Hi James, thanks for your interest! Unfortunately I can't add the ability to listen to marine VHF channels for a weird reason - [it may be illegal](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/36/section/48)! This is the same reason that sites like [LiveATC](https://www.liveatc.net) don't include air traffic control radio feeds for the UK.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in replicating this for yourself and including the ability to listen to marine VHF, here are some hints that you may wish to use at your discretion...\r\n\r\n1. A standard RTL-SDR has a bandwidth of 2MHz, with AIS channel B up at 162.025 MHz. This means a single RTL-SDR will only be able to hear [marine VHF channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_VHF_radio) over 160MHz. This covers the upper half of the duplex channels but not the lower half, and not the simplex channels such as 16 that you might be interested in. For that, you'd need a second RTL-SDR, or a receiver with a higher bandwidth (e.g. HackRF with 10MHz).\r\n\r\n2. There are a variety of ways of getting SDR audio onto the web. [WebSDR](http://www.websdr.org) is an option but it is closed source and only available to people who make their stream available on `websdr.org` itself. [YouSDR](https://github.com/sixuniform/yousdr) doesn't come with any restrictions so may be a better choice, it may a bit tricky to set up but the README does include full instructions. Then there are more \"DIY\" options such as using a combination of [rtl_fm](http://kmkeen.com/rtl-demod-guide/), [ezstream](https://icecast.org/ezstream/), [IceCast](https://icecast.org/) and [rtl_fm_python](https://github.com/th0ma5w/rtl_fm_python).\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or get stuck I'd be happy to help, but as I say unfortunately I can't offer this myself as part of Plane/Sailing."
