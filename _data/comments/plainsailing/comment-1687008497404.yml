  I just wanted to thank you again for the recommendation of AIS-Catcher&mdash;I
  have done some testing and I think I get around 10x as many messages as I did
  with `rtl_ais`! Given that I don't have line of sight to the sea, my
  expectations were low, but it has genuinely made a huge difference. I have
  updated the guide to recommend it to others as well.
