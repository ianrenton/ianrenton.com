message: "rtl_ais is now outdated and has poor performance/detection.\r\nmost people now use https://github.com/jvde-github/AIS-catcher\r\n\r\nfor a simple plane/aircraft view on map you can use leaflet and the json output from ais-catcher and adsb\r\n\r\nAs a side note, airframes.io is in the process of mapping planes, ships, acars messages weather balloons etc"
