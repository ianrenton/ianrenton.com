message: "Hi sir, first of all that's amazing project I really impressed. I tried to run both server and client side but somehow I got some problems for example I just have AIS log data (.txt format), not antenna etc. So what should I do? I dont have a reveiver source actually. Also 8090 Server port working fine but I should close some of the settings in conf file. How can I getting contact with you for this? I mean at the following stages maybe I need to send to you some screenshots. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance, have a nice day."
