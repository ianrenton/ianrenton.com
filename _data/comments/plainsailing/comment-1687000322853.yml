message: "Thanks for the information! I'll give AIS-catcher a try and see if it improves performance over rtl_ais.\r\n\r\nI don't think I can feed anything useful to airframes.io at the moment, unless it starts supporting ADS-B or similar. I would need *yet another* SDR to start receiving VDL/ACARS data!"
