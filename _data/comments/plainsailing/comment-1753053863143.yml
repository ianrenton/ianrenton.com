message: "Hi Ian,\r\nFirstly awesome work mate, very impressive.\r\nI have a question which I am hoping you may be able to help with.\r\nI am in NZ and the AIS network here is VERY limited, I am looking to place a few sensors around the area and link them via Lorar back to a single Pi running AIS Catcher to upload so that I don't need a cel link for each unit. Would this be doable with your system? Cheers Dave"
