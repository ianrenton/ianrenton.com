  Hi there! You may have misunderstood the logic behind changing the RTL-SDR
  serial numbers - it's entirely optional, it just helps to keep them organised
  when you have three of them plugged into a single computer! I'll update the
  page to make that clearer. (Of course an AIS hat reduces the number of
  RTL-SDRs required so that helps too!)
