message: "Hello Ian,\r\n\r\nI wanna ask something about project for Client side. I wanna run this Client project as offline. How could I do that? I made GeoServer map and put as a map option but this is not my issue. When there is no internet connection, I cant click both Info, Config and Track Table buttons. They all are disable to click. How can I do this client as offline? Thx."
