  <p>To be honest the opposite worries me a little; having so much of this
  content online places responsibility for preserving it in the hands of someone
  else's servers. If Livejournal were to disappear tomorrow, I'd lose 6 years of
  my journal. That's not great (and probably a sign that I should really get
  around to doing a backup). As a serial pack-rat not much of my stuff has been
  lost to time, I still have diaries and drawings from 1993, but virtual content
  stored online is another matter.</p>
