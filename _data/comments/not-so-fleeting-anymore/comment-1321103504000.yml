  <p>aefaradien: I think Search and marketing together probably tend to kill of
  non-public parts of the internet.  If you want to be found, you've got to be
  on Google -- word of mouth doesn't cut it
  anymore.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Psyfira: Regular backups are your friend! All my
  hosted files and databases are backed up weekly, mailbox synced via IMAP every
  10 minutes, etc. :)  LiveJournal can certainly be exported, though I'm not
  sure how easy it would be to set up an automated backup.  I'd back up Twitter
  and Facebook too, if only there was some way of restoring from the backups in
  the event of server-side data loss.</p>
