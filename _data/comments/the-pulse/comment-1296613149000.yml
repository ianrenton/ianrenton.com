  <p>Pretty much.  I'm not into the whole immortality side of things, but human
  bodies and minds have flaws and I think it's pretty inevitable that in the
  next few hundred years we'll have the ability to fix many of
  them.</p><p></p><p></p><p>From my last few blog posts it's probably apparent
  that I consider caffeine and adrenaline handy things to have in my brain, and
  if other methods of improving or augmenting my brain function comes along,
  I'll happily give them a shot.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Especially if I can jack
  into a Neuromancer-esque bad 80s VR cyberspace, but I'm probably alone there
