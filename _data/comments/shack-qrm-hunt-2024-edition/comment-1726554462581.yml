  I did eventually do that for the Plane/Sailing setup, which is now on three Pi
  Zeros driven from the same 12v PSU as the main radios. The mini PCs are 65W
  each and I am already close to my 12v PSU's limit if I transmit at 100W, so
  I'm worried about brownouts if I put them on the same PSU. I could get a
  bigger one I suppose, or a second one... Something to bear in mind, thank you!
