  <p>Wow, this looks a lot like these 2 tank of mine that I
  hacked:</p><p></p><p></p><p>The 1st time I went down your path and tried to
  keep the existing electronics. However I couldn't reverse engineer the comm
  codes, so I simply connected my Arduino (and then FEZ Domino) directly on the
  the control pins:</p><p></p><p></p><p><a

  2nd time, I completely replaced ALL the electronics with my own motor drivers,
  controled by an Arduino, which in turn is controlled by the main brain,a Lego
  NXT (with LeJOS running).</p><p></p><p></p><p><a

  must have already seen this 2nd version, it's already been featured on
  hackaday, and I find it pretty cool as you can really control anything, and it
  also has an IR camera which allows it to rack IR
  targets...</p><p></p><p></p><p>In any case, cool project and this motivates me
  to  go back to using the original electronics
  eventually...</p><p></p><p></p><p>Thanks,<br>Dan</p>
