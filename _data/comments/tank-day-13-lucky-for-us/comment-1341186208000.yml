  <p>trandi: I did see your second build on Hack a Day, it almost swayed me
  towards doing all the internal electronics myself!  I'm not too hot on power
  electronics and motor control though, so I decided just to tap in on the
  digital side.  Your tank does seem to have much smoother motor control than
  mine, though, so I might end up going down that route in
  future.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Mikl&#243s: Thanks! I don't know much about the
  webcam's capabilities under Linux yet (I just read on the forum that it was
  compatible with the Pi), but assuming it can output something sensible, that
  looks like a good way of incorporating video into the web UI.</p>
