  <p>While I am generally on board with multiculturalism, I really do have to
  disagree. If someone comes from a culture where caste systems are common,
  their culture is worse than ours (in that instance). If someone comes from a
  culture where female genital multilation is common, their culture is worse
  than ours (in that instance). If someone comes from a culture that practices
  Sharia law, that culture is worse than ours (in that instance). I added the
  "in that instance" disclaimer as there are obviously ways in which said
  culture might be superior to ours, and those should be preserved, but there
  are certain parts of cultures which immigrants might bring which are actively
  harmful.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I love culture and all it brings with it for the
  most part, just wanted to be clear that I don't think we can be quite as
  ambivalent. I'm pretty certain that Britain's culture is much better than
  Saudia Arabia's, for a for instance. On language... I dunno. I think the world
  would be a better place if we could all communicate via one language, but I
  don't know if that should be English.</p>
