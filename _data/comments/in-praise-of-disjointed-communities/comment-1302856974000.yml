  <p>@Ali: Damn foreigners, coming over here, designing our gardens... doesn't
  really work, does it? :D</p><p></p><p></p><p>@Martin: I'm confused -- in your
  first paragraph you say you don't think other cultures are necessarily equal
  to ours, but in the second paragraph you seem to be saying that they
  are!</p><p></p><p></p><p>I wasn't suggesting that our culture was less
  deserving of recognition or that we should apologise for it, merely that we
  shouldn't expect others to conform to it just because they choose to live on
  the same island as us. So long as it doesn't cause harm to others, everyone,
  including us, should be free to define their culture however they
  want.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Still don't like shepherd's pie though, unless it's
  got a ton of cheese on the top.</p>
