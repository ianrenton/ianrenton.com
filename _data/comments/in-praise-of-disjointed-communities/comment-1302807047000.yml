  <p>Given that I have been here since 1997, was educated here, and whenever I
  was employed I paid my taxes here, I honestly get very tired of this stupid
  shit about how all immigrants are bad.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Language is
  brilliant though. I speak two, and because of that I could easily teach myself
  a third if I wanted to, but more importantly, it makes life a lot of more
  colourful. People with English as a second language often speak more
  colourfully and more poetically because they're still thinking in their first
  language and then translating into English. That's awesome, and shows how
  adaptable human beings are.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As to 'all immigrants are
  bad': My only revenge is to be one of the best garden designers of the next
  age, and outright refuse to do work for Daily Mail-reading toffs. I mean, they
  wouldn't want <em>me</em> to work for them, surely, being from some
  brown/beige/yellow heritage?</p><p></p><p></p><p>(The irony that my last name
  is Irish hasn't escaped me. I've had a few instance where people have done
  double takes).</p>
