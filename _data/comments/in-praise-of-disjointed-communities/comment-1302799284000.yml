  <p>That's a lot of "in that instance" -- I suspect there are just as many
  aspects of British culture that are worse than most others. Chavs, maybe, or
  football hooligans? That we're suspicious of our neighbours, or uncaring about
  the elderly? If you can't think of any, ask someone from another country and
  see how long the list they provide is. :)  The important thing is that by
  having all these cultures, they start to interact in a way that hopefully
  induces pressure on cultures -- including our own -- to reject their worse
  aspects.</p><p></p><p></p><p>(Sharia law is a more complicated issue, by the
  way. There are huge variations worldwide in how it is interpreted, practiced
  and enforced. Some countries make it a cornerstone of their society, whilst
  for others it is very much a personal code of conduct. For some it implies
  man's superiority over woman, for others, it demands equality for all. As in
  all things, it's not so black-and-white as to be a universally negative aspect
  to a culture.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>Regarding language, in lots of little ways,
  I think language is difficult to separate from culture because the two evolve
  together. There are phrases and concepts in each language that don't translate
  very well to others, and I think the world is left culturally poorer if we
  lose things like that. And I say this despite too many awkward silences with
  my Spanish in-laws and too much improvised sign language with heavily armed
  Middle-Easterners! :)</p>
