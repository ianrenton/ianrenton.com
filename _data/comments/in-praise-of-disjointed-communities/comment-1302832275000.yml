  <p>Hmm. While I'm in complete disagreement with the usual Tory nonsense, I'm
  not sure I'm in complete agreement with you either. Everyone else's culture us
  not equal to ours <em>by definition</em>, as pointed out (repeatedly) above.
  Neither is other nations' food better, by definition; as much as I love my
  curry and Chinese and Thai - when was the last time you had a really good
  shepherd's pie? I'd contest it was more to do with
  exoticism.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As much as we may love multiculturalism, there
  has to be a point where you recognise that British culture is equally
  deserving of recognition. Equal, not greater or lesser but somewhere in
  between. I'm the least nationalist person around, but I don't think we should
  be apologising for our cultural traits. Our history, by all means, but to
  complain about the  British 'make-do' attitude is to ignore an important part
  of our cultural make-up. Others take pride in their cultural traits, so why
  should we apologise for ours? Tea-drinking and general grumpiness should be
  just as valid as any other trait which makes up our complex, varied
  country.</p>
