  <p>I think you're right, that the action of cultures mixing is usually good,
  provided it happens under a liberal democracy with certain legal assumptions
  protecting individuals. This is what's happened historically, anyhow. I just
  wanted to be clear that "Everyone else's culture is just as good as ours"
  isn't necessarily true. Saudia Arabia is worse than the UK on most
  measures.</p><p><br>              </p><p>I guess you're right about language,
  its just frustrating that along with that we lose the ability to easily
  understand other nations, and appreciate their art and culture on their terms.
  I guess I just want someone to go ahead and invent a universal translator
  already.</p>
