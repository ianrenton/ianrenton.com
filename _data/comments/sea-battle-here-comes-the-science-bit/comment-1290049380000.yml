  <p>@Mark: I wasn't planning on an economy or buildings, to try and keep it
  simple.  See my latest post for the great debate on whether it should be
  simple or not :)@Sam: If the AI is ganging up on you with Patrol Boats, try
  researching some better radar to give you a range advantage as they'll go down
  in two shots from a Harpoon.  With a couple of radar levels of advantage, you
  should easily be able to get those off before the enemy ships can fire.</p>
