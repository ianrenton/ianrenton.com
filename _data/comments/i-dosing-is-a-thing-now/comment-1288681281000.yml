  been around for years, but the core ingredient, binaural beats, is far older.
  And it's not "music" in the conventional sense. What got the Mail all excited
  is that i-doser sells binaural tracks named after drugs, implying (but I think
  without actually claiming) that they replicate their effects. And, let's face
  it, anyone gullible enough to buy that is well-placed to get a good trip off a
  placebo.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Most reputable scientists claim that binaural
  beats causing any kind of "brainwave entrainment" is a load of
  pseudoscientific nonsense. I've never used i-doser but about 4-5 years ago I

  i-doser actually uses at its core: until 2007 it was violating the GPL by
  doing so) and found that they did seem to have an effect, albeit a mild one,
  and any beneficial effect from helping one drift off to sleep is rather
  cancelled out by nearly choking yourself to death on your headphone cable (it
  only works through headphones), so I gave it up. There were no withdrawal
  symptoms.</p>
