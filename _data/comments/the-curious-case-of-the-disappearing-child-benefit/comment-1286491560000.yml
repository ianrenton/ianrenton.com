  <p>Whilst the bar is high enough, it does kind of discriminate against
  families with only one worker. As someone strongly in favour of kids having at
  least one parent available most of the time, it does seem to be a bit unfair.
  The tax break still doesn't address single parents and, as someone with close
  family members who had two kids grow above the age of 16 before getting
  married, I find the whole thing a bit ham-fisted.</p>
