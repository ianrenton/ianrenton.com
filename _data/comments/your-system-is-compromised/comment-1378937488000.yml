  <p>Hear, hear. And it's not like this is an entirely new state of affairs
  either - curtain twitching neighbours, pickpockets and peeping toms pre-date
  the invention of the integrated circuit.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That being said,
  the scales are definitely in the wrong place at the moment. It would probably
  be extremely bad for society if I, a random fool with a bit of computing
  knowledge and an interest in privacy could keep secrets from international
  governments, there are other organisations and people (random criminals,
  spyware, marketers, bored script kiddies) that I'd like to be able to keep
  secrets from (bank account details, my physical location, shopping habits) and
  am not at all convinced that I can.</p>
