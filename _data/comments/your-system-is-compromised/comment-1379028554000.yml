  <p>Agreed, part of the problem with deliberately compromising hardware or
  software is that once the vulnerability is discovered by one person, it often
  ends up in the wild where it becomes usable by those with more nefarious
  purposes. (Assuming for a moment that the purposes of the NSA and friends
  don't qualify as nefarious.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>It takes a lot of effort for
  the end user to secure their bank/card details and physical location —
  remembering to check that websites use SSL, turning off "use my location" on
  mobile apps, etc. — and it's inevitable that people will slip up. The saying
  that "nothing is forgotten on the Internet" is true not only of kids'
  embarrassing status updates but this kind of stuff
  too.</p><p></p><p></p><p>And by this point, I think our shopping habits are a
  bit of a lost cause!</p>
