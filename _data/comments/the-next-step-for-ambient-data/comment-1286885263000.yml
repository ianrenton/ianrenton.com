  <p>My apologies, I think that strayed a little from the point you were going
  for and to be fair you did discuss the limitations inherent in the current
  display technology.  I just see on a regular basis people being far too
  obsessed with the use of photo style data (aerial or satellite especially)
  when in fact a basic map would actually serve the purpose of displaying the
  relevant information far better.  A lot of reality style overlays look to be
  dangerously headed in the same direction at present.</p>
