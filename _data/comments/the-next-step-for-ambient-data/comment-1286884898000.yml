  <p>While I love the idea of being able to call up this information on HUD
  style displays, I think that there is the possibility to lose site of what on
  a chart or diagram is actually important and necessary
  information,</p><p></p><p></p><p>As an example, which I know isn't overlaying
  on the world in front of us but serves to illustrate my point, marine charts
  are increasingly coming with the option to show satellite imagery over all the
  land segments.  Now I can see this can have its uses, if you are on a
  coastline then there may be times that seeing the house on the point may be of
  benefit.  Most of the time however it serves as a distraction, complicating
  the image in ways that are unnecessary and distracting from the important data
  within the water.  The traditional yellow colour for land makes it a lot
  easier to concentrate on the separation between areas of
  relevance.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of being
  able to call up AIS data on ships as they come over the horizon, with little
  blocks of data that can be called up around any sighted vessels.  I just don't
  think there is the screen technology available yet to do this in a
  satisfactory fashion (especially in a system where it may be relied upon for
  safety).  I also don't think that you can completely replace the diagrammatic
  representation of the data, or should, simply for the fact that a diagram
  represents a simplified view of the world focusing on the relevant pieces of
  information.</p>
