  not about the BNP being stupid and the opposite therefore being intelligent or
  right.  It's about them declaring what's in their best interests, and voters
  deliberately choosing to do the opposite because they know it is <em>not</em>
  in the BNP's best interests.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For me, the AV vote is about
  a lot more than just keeping the BNP further from power.  But for many people
  completely disillusioned with the main parties, it could be just enough of a
  reason to sway their vote.</p>
