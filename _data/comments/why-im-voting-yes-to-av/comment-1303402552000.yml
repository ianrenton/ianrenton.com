  most votes in the first round? That makes two people saying NO to AV who would
  have lost out considerably under FPTP. I'm sure they're both at work even now
  reforming their own party system. How humble our politicians

  risking ... insert potential disaster here... years of political stalemate,
  say, just to stop their inexorable march to power, their condemnation is not
  justification for voting YES to AV.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i> > For me, the AV
  vote is about a lot more than just keeping the BNP further from
