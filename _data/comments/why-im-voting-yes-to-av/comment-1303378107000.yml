  <p>Very much agreed.  I was scouring the 'net for pro- and anti-AV arguments
  while writing this, and a good 90% of them consist of the No campaign saying
  "AV is expensive and undemocractic!" while the Yes campaign say "No it's
  not!".</p><p></p><p></p><p>Unfortunately I'm in agreement with the pessimism
  too -- there's nothing to say that if Yes wins, AV actually happens right then
  and there.  And looking at the polls, I'm not convinced Yes will win at
  all.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I'm less convinced about PR than I used to be, though
  -- as I understand them, most PR systems <em>would</em> lead to more coalition
  governments, and our limited experience of those so far has not exactly been a
  good one.</p><p></p><p></p><p>However, if one accepts that the purpose of
  voting is to turn people's preferences into reality (and it really should be),
  then there's no fairer way of doing that than PR.  So on those grounds, I
  guess I am in principle in favour of PR over both FPTP and AV.</p>
