  stupidity is not intelligence. Fools sometimes get things right (or I'd be out
  of a job ;) ). An action that is not one obvious kind of wrong is not
  necessarily right.<br>Though it would be awesome if our entire political
  system could be stripped down into the following:<br>1) Vote the nastiest,
  most clueless racist bastards you can into power.<br>2) Do the opposite of
  whatever decisions come out of Whitehall.</p>
