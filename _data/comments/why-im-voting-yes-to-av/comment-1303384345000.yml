  <p>Andrew Rilstone has been talking about this stuff a bit recently (<a
  href="http://www.andrewrilstone.com/" rel="nofollow
  noopener">http://www.andrewrilstone.com/</a> - the "What if they gave an
  election and no one came" section). It's all been rather thought
  provoking.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It's not entirely obvious that the purpose of
  voting should be to turn people's preferences into reality. Or at least not
  the preferences they express when asked, which may be over or under
  exaggerated, naive or just derived from something other than their actual
  utility function (tradition, cantankerousness, greed
  etc).</p><p></p><p></p><p>Am intrigued about the coalition comment, is it
  really fair to generalise to all coalition governments from this one? I was
  under the impression it seemed to work quite well in the 160 odd countries
  that currently employ some kind of PR and a vague recollection suggests we
  fought WWII under a coalition. As with committees, and indeed governments
  everywhere, it may be the people that are the problem.

  position as PM to AV, in that if Tory leadership elections were FPTP we'd have
  someone else screwing the country up. :)</p>
