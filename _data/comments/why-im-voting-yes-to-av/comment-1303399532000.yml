  <p>I'm not sure there's necessarily a deeper reason. As Rilstone says in the
  page you linked, no-one ever <em>designed</em> our electoral system, it just
  came to be over time, presumably having its beginnings in the parliaments of
  Cromwell et al.  If there is a deliberate reason, it's either pretty old
  itself, or it's been retconned! :)</p><p></p><p></p><p>I wasn't saying today's
  British politicians are a different breed, just that they're as new to
  coalitions as we are, and unlike in wartime they don't have a common threat to
  fight.  The most pressing problem for our country today is the economy, and
  our coalition is at odds over how to tackle it.  "Let's not let Kaiser Wilhelm
  / Adolf Hitler rule Europe" was a common goal an order of magnitude more
  important than our concerns today (IMHO).</p><p></p><p></p><p>I'm disappointed
  with Ed Miliband's lack of awkward-question-asking, too.  Oh!  There was the
  point I wanted to make.  Draw from this what you will about AV, but <a 0=""
