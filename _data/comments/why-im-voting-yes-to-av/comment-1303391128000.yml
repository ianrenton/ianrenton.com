  <p>HolyHaddock:</p><p></p><p></p><p>"People are the problem" is a really
  slippery slope that ends in "I should be in charge, because I don't like the
  crazy racists and only a dictatorship can guarantee stopping them". (Not that
  I'd turn down the opportunity if it presented
  itself.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>There's a balance to strike somewhere, between
  absolute PR where everyone is represented fairly no matter how much of a
  nutter they are, and our current system where you're only in luck if you
  support a mediocre Middle England-chasing party of the centre.  I'm not sure
  exactly where I'd strike that balance, but AV is at least a step in the right
  direction.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If coalitions were the status quo (as in other
  countries) or we had bigger fish to fry (WW2) then perhaps they'd be more
  bearable and their members more co-operative.  As it is, politicians squabble
  and throw their toys out of the pram on a daily basis, rather than spending
  their time working for the good of the country.  Maybe it's not people that
  are the problem, so much as politicians and especially political
  parties?</p><p></p><p></p><p>FYI, Labour elect their leaders by AV too. Not
  sure if I had a point there, but figured I'd say it anyway :)</p>
