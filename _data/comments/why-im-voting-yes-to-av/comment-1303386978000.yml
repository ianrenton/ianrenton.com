  <p>I agree completely with this blog post. I was originally NO on AV, but
  after reading up more on the subject I'm definitely backing a YES
  vote.<br>There are so many myths being put about by anti-AV voters, the main
  thing that initially had me saying NO, was that I was informed it would allow
  the BNP and UKIP as well as other extremist parties to get
  seats.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But having put some thought into it and learning
  more about AV, I can see that AV would actually do the opposite. In fact, the
  current FPTP system has already allowed the BNP to get seats.<br>Also if the
  idea that AV would allow the BNP to get seats were true then why are the BNP
  urging their supporters to vote NO on AV?</p><p></p><p></p><p>I think this
  page is quite interesting: <a

  will definitely be voting YES on May 5th.<br>Nice post.</p>
