  <p>I can't say too much for the writing side, but at least for the reading I
  actually find setting goals makes me better at doing the things that require a
  longer attention span.  Of course it requires me to not do other things
  though, like watching Pokemon episodes on Netflix.  I think the achievement to
  be reached (for me at least) has more sticking power than a simple "I should
  read more".</p><p></p><p></p><p>Usually the goal is a simple read x books in x
  time.  The longer the period the goal is over, the more I find myself
  slipping.  I haven't yet found the ideal period of time to think in, the only
  thing I can say with certainty is that usually if I make it a year long goal
  by about 8 months I'll have drifted and be flagging.</p>
