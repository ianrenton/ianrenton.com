message: "QUOTE\r\nThe manual warns you to ensure you are only touching a single round of the coil, though I’m not sure it really matters too much. Electricity is going to flow via the shortest route, so touching the next round up doesn’t seem to make a lot of difference.\r\nUNQUOTE\r\n\r\nShort two loops and you have just made a stand-alone loop that will absorb all the RF it can and turn it into heating that loop.\r\n\r\n73 de Andrew/N5ASE\r\n\r\nPS:  Glad you found the manual readable.  I too own this nice little antenna and found the chinese manual unreadable, as you might expect, so I translated it into english via Google Translate, reformatted the document to make it look better, printed it out to PDF and emailed it back to the manufacturer, so I'm gald you found \"my\" manual readable! :-)"
