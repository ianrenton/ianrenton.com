  <p>Shit, I didn't even think about Wikileaks.Ah, but the site itself won't be
  going anywhere, and everyone outside the UK will still be able to access it -
  including, hopefully, journalists with the wit to set up foreign proxies or
  look at what the foreign media are reporting.It's somewhat galling to think
  that freedom of the press in this country will rely on external agents, but
  c'est la vie.</p>
