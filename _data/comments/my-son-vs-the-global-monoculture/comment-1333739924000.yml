  <p>The reward in travel for me is not so much experiencing different cultures
  but in managing to function as a normal person in whatever culture and not
  come across as a tourist.  Possibly a weird by-product of growing up in a
  tourist town.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That said, I do realise that other people
  <em>do</em> travel for that reason.  A lot of science fiction that has trodden
  this particular path has ended up with things like "culture reserves" in the
  sense that the US has "reserves" to preserve what little remains of Native
  American culture.  That doesn't feel like a nice solution though, and the
  science fiction they appear in tends towards the dystopian.  (I suspect we're
  heading for one of those futures anyway, but that's probably worth saving for
  another post...) :)</p>
