  <p>I'm pretty much with you on this but: "I look forward to a future where he
  can travel and communicate with others from the far corners of the world

  become, the less travel seems to give any meaningful reward.    Okay, so the
  landscape may be different but what does that matter if all you're doing is
  visiting 'Britain but with different weather'?</p>
