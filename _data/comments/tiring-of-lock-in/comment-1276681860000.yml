  <p>Get a Nokia and see how much you like to be locked into software then.
  Several Nokia N series phones taught me to never ever trust their desktop or
  phone software. Even now, friends with the devices have them crash daily, and
  the PC sync software fails after several months of use. Thankfully, I was an
  iTunes fan before the phones came out. As a music management tool, it's the
  best out there for Windows and Mac. It provides a one-touch minimal setup with
  iPhones that pretty much 'just works'. Average Joe wouldn't know what Linux
  was (saying that, the mother-in-law uses Ubuntu) but she would never have an
  iPhone. Plus, this is a phone. I want it to make and receive calls with no
  fuss or worrying that what I've installed will stop or slow the phone. And if
  you don't like it? Jailbreak!It pains me to see all these Android devices
  being compromised by vendors and manufacturers. All devices should be created
  equal.</p>
