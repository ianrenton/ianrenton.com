  <p>The very best thing it had was tone calling. You put it to the phone and
  pressed the button and it dialled the number. Psion brought out Series 5,
  everyone wanted it (better keyboard etc), but the tone calling barely worked
  as it was a couple of hertz off (I could hear the fractional pitch difference
  and it didn't matter how close you held it to the phone, it would frequently
  dial wrong, not dial at all, etc). I contacted them and all I got was denial.
  A phone database that doesn't connect to anything is useless. They could have
  been up there with Nokia or even Apple, but this is a lesson to future
  management.. This is what happens when you get careless. It is also a sad
  indictment on globalisation -- only the best wins.</p>
