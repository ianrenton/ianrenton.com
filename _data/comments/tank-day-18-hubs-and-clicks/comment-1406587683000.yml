  <p>Thanks!</p><p></p><p></p><p>There are currently two 5V DC/DCs in the
  system. A 1A version supplies the Pi, while a 1.5A version supplies the hub
  (and hence the attached Wifi dongle and webcam). As you say, the Pi could have
  been powered from the hub, which would remove the need for one of the DC/DCs.
  However, you'd have to upgrade the one supplying the hub to a 2A or 3A variant
  to make sure it can supply enough current for
  everything.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If I were starting again from scratch, that's
  what I'd do for sure, as it would make the wiring a bit neater.</p>
