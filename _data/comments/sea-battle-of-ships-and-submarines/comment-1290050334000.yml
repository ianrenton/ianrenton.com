  <p>Maybe one of the problems is that I've never really considered my
  hypothetical target audience, and I'm just making a game for the hell of it
  because I like 2D pixelly ships! :)</p><p></p><p></p><p>Islands are certainly
  an interesting idea, though it would mean getting off my arse and coding a
  real pathfinding algorithm.  I'll give it a shot, though I fear it might tip
  it over the complexity edge where I have to code it in something other than
  Processing, with associated risk of stalling.  Worth a try though!</p>
