  <p>Depends what your hypothetical target audience is, really. Are you aiming
  at time-poor or attention-deficient consumers (ie commuters and teenagers), or
  the sort of guy who wants to spend a bit of time playing something with a bit
  more depth?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Obviously even if it's the former, you still
  need a certain amount of complexity. Maybe as the previous comment mentioned,
  you could remove submarines by having your game take place in the shallows -
  but not just a shallow sea. Instead we're talking about a series of islands -
  it justifies the lack of submarines and adds a smidgeon of subtlety to the
  gameplay. Maybe some kind of fractal terrain randomiser, so every game is
  different?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Other thoughts: what about being able to place
  your base, rather than them always being in the same place? The computer
  selects a location (in secret), then you do?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Apologies if
  I'm making suggestions wildly beyond the scope of the feasible. Non-existent
  programming skills equals no clue as to the nitty-gritty.</p>
