  <p>The poll problem seems to be a JavaScript issue - the Vote/View Results
  buttons fired JS calls that didn't exist, because the plugins wasn't putting
  any JS stuff in the headers. But even when I added the plugin's JS files
  manually, it still didn't work.  So: screw it.  No poll, let's just use the
  comments :)</p>
