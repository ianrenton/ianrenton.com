  <p>Late response (catching up on RSS feeds): I like the light-box, but it is
  too small.   Can you make it show more than one line?  It seems silly to have
  test of the edge of the screen when there is that much empty space on screen. 
  Also there is a strange JS delay between clicking reply and the light-box
  appearing.</p>
