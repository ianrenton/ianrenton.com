  <p>Its just occurred to me also that the concept of "cloning" objects is a
  Really Bad Idea (TM).  Does a cloned object reference the same children as the
  parent, or new copies of those?  Much tidier to have a factory method(s) for
  creating new objects of that type.  Then the static factory method lives in a
  class with a private constructor.</p>
