  <p>That does indeed seem to be silly and pointless.  It not efficient either
  from a programming or run-time point of view.  It looks like someone trying to
  make their crazy idea stick so that can justify the existence of either the
  silly idea or them selves.  Code like that makes me think egos are involved
  (though its mostly a guess).</p><p></p><p></p><p>Every GUI system I have seen
  uses data-source interfaces as providers (SWT, Android, etc.).  Storing data
  in the GUI is a really bad idea... aside from being a PITA to code, it results
  in data being stored in more than once place.  Much better to keep the data in
  once place and reference it from multiple places - and I Java interfaces are a
  good way of allowing / controlling this.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Can you measure
  the cost / impact of this crazy system (run-time efficiency, buggyness of
  code, developer headaches, etc.) and use that as evidence to get it fixed?</p>
