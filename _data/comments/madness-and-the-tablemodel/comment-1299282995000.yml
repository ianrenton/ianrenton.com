  <p>The toolkit isn't something I have any power over, so I can't really get it
  fixed -- however, I can probably avoid using it at certain crucial
  points.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In response to your second post, it all depends on
  how you implement clone().  It's not something that your own classes support
  unless you code the function yourself.  In my case the objects I'm cloning
  only have primitive member variables, so I don't have that worry anyway, but
  you're right, a factory is a more designpatterny way of doing
  it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A colleague of mine suggested a way to use Generics to
  work around the ReallyCloneable hack as well, so I might even end up with some
  non-WTF code sooner or later! :)</p>
