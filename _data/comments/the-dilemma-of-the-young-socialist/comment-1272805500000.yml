  <p>I don't particularly mind if there are hand-outs to the middle classes or
  not, I just don't want to see them at the expense of those that go to people
  who actually need them.  I'm well towards the poorer end of being middle
  class, but I'd happily take a modest tax increase if it meant no more families
  would be below the bread-line.Political-parties-as-vampires is doing strange
  things to my head, damn you! :)</p>
