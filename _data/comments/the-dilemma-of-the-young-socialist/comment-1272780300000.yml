  <p>Don't the principles it had 30 years ago more or less boil down to 'don't
  court the middle-classes, court the working-classes'?Seems as if the only
  parties which can afford to actually have significantly divergent policies are
  the minor parties (or am I inverting causation?). If the policies of the three
  main parties aren't viewed as being significantly different I guess you're
  left voting on which one you like most/dislike least.</p>
