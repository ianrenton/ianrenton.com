  <p>If you want someone who isn't courting the Middle Classes, shouldn't you be
  thinking BNP or maybe UKIP? Or is it more a matter of wanting the courting to
  be a bit more subtle (court me, but don't let me feel like I'm being
  courted!).I'm curious that I haven't seen many people actually talking about
  voting based on policies - but then the only policy I feel remotely confident
  judging the coherence of party manifestoes on is energy and very few parties
  have bothered to actually give much detail on that.</p>
