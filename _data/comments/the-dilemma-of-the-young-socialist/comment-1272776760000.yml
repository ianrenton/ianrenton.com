  <p>Being middle-class myself I don't mind being courted, even overtly, it just
  seems like Labour no longer stands for the same principles it did thirty years
  ago.Agreed on people not talking about policies - maybe its just that no-one
  likes the incumbent government for a myriad of tiny reasons rather than any
  major issue, and a lot of people don't like the Tories for vague historical
  reasons that they're not sure still apply?</p>
