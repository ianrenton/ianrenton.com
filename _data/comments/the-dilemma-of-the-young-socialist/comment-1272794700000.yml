  <p>Pretty much.  Maybe it's just my lack of personal experience at work here
  and actually New Labour's been peachy for those on low incomes struggling to
  feed their families, but my guess would be not.I suspect the cause and effect
  there can both ways, though AFAIK in the history of British politics Labour is
  the only party to have ever transitioned from a minor party to a serious
  contender.And you're dead right, we are pretty much down to a "which one do
  you dislike least" vote, hence mine for the Lib Dems.  (Ironically, their
  energy policy is probably the thing I most disagree with!)</p>
