  <p>We want to <em>have</em> hand outs to the middle classes but we want to
  <em>see</em> handouts to the lower classes?Maybe it's like vampires - Labour
  became a major power by drinking the ichor of the Liberal party, the Lib Dems
  can only make it back by successfully diablerising Labour?I'm entertained that
  the Lid Dems who seem largely in favour of political centralisation (at least,
  with respect to Europe) are adamantly against centralised power generation,
  while UKIP, the violently anti-centralisation party want 50% electricity
  production from nuclear (ironically, their energy policy reads like a watered
  down, fluffier version of France's).</p>
