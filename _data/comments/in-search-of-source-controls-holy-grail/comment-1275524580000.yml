  <p>We manage that kind of thing with a combination of separate repositories
  and pre/post commit hooks. Unfortunately, there are no pre-checkout hooks.
  After a bit of google-fu, I found a suggestion that finer grained permission
  control is possible if you're full of masochistic - <a

  and Perforce have fine grained access controls, though I've no practical
  experience of either, and my general feel for the rumour mill is that neither
  are worth the hassle.Christ, can Maven really not cope with compilers that
  aren't javac? I didn't think anything could be more riddled with Fail than
  Ant...Yars! Hell, I'm feeling the urge to quit and start a circus.
  Interested?</p>
