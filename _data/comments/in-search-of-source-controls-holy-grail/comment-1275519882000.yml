  <p>Problem is, some people <i>won't</i> adapt to a new environment -- most
  people aren't as committed to making re-use easier as we are, and if we make
  things too difficult we run the risk of people splintering off and doing
  things their own way.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It's only been a few years since I
  bullied a lot of people into going from fileshares to SVN and from paper forms
  to Mantis.  Don't wanna rock the boat too much too soon. :(</p>
