  <p>The problem with open source source control systems is that they are
  designed and written only with open source systems in mind.  So far as I can
  tell there are no open source systems that support ACL (access control
  levels).  Let alone provide any form of process management (like enforcing
  reviews of change sets before they are delivered).</p><p></p><p></p><p>The
  best system I know of is Rational Team Concert (<a

  noopener">http://jazz.net/projects/rational-team-concert</a>).  This is what I
  use every day at work and so far it is going far better than anything else we
  have used.  (and access to their defect tracker helps too :D ).  There is a
  free version for 10 devs or less and this is what I intend to run on my new
  server as soon as I get it working.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Obviously its not
  free, but so far as I know there is nothing open source that comes even
  close.</p>
