<p>They say that there is a state known as lucid dreaming, whereby one realises one is dreaming without waking up.  With this realisation comes power - the power to fly, to go anywhere in an instant, to have revenge on your enemies or to become a great hero.  And all this within your dream, where mere thought directs your experience.  Anything you believe you can do, you can do.</p>
<p>We&#039;d use that state for personal gratification, wouldn&#039;t we?  After all, dreams aren&#039;t real, and your dreams are private things that only you experience, so why not?  What&#039;s the harm?</p>
<p>But what if they&#039;re not just your dreams?  What if they&#039;re everyone&#039;s dreams - billions of dream-worlds, combined into one?</p>
<p>And what if those dream-people, when they went to sleep, dreamed of us?</p>
<p>Of course, you&#039;re the real person, right?  You know the difference between dreaming and being awake.  Do they?</p>
<p>Is the real you, the product of nature and nurture, of society&#039;s expectations and the limits of your species, truly the real you?  Is the dream-you, your self-image, unconstrained by the cage of society and biology, perhaps more true, more real?</p>
<p>What would be the result if, rather than mere idle speculation, this debate became a matter of life and death for two parallel sets of human beings?  Two worlds, so different and yet so dependent on each other, are on a collision course.</p>
<p>Why?  And how is that even possible?</p>
<p>Who are we, what are we?  What do we want, and what do we fear?  And what is truly real?</p>
<p>This is Dreaming Awake.  It is in equal parts epic fantasy, psychological horror and philosophical treatise.  And it might even get written sometime in the next few decades.</p>
