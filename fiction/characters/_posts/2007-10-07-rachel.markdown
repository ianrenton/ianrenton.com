<h2>Rachel&#039;s Card</h2>
<p>Rachel&#039;s card, Temperance, is the 14th card of the Major Arcana in what people tend to recognise as a "standard" Tarot deck. Here, it symbolises her peaceful and non-confrontational personality.</p>
<h2>Author&#039;s Notes</h2>
<p>Rachel is a character I feel uneasy about. She&#039;s one of the character concepts that came out of the Fanfic idea originally, and thus is a character that was invented by someone other than me. The reason for the uneasiness is that I&#039;ve never met this person and I have no idea how to contact her, and I&#039;ve also lost her original character description. All I&#039;m left with is a memory of the character&#039;s name, species, sex, elemental affiliation (Earth, in this case) and the idea that she used a glaive as a weapon. So, over the course of sorting out the characters for Dreaming Awake, I&#039;ve redesigned Rachel several times over, and I&#039;m sure I&#039;m probably getting further and further away from the original concept that she gave me. Hopefully, if she ever gets to read Dreaming Awake, she won&#039;t be disappointed with what I&#039;ve done... </p>
