If you've read [the first post in this series](/blog/52-week-ham-radio-challenge-roundup-weeks-1-4/) or are playing along yourself, you'll be aware of the [52 Week Ham Radio Challenge](https://hamchallenge.org/). If not, hit up that link for the details!

This post covers the challenges from weeks 37-40, which were:

<ol start="37">
  <li><a href="#week37">Work 10 DXCCs on FT8</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week38">Make a contact on Morse code!</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week35">Make a 2-way contact with an output power of 100 mW or less.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week36">Which QSLing methods do you use, physical and electronic?</a></li>
</ol>

### Week 37 (8-14 Sep): Work 10 DXCCs on FT8 {#week37}

### Week 38 (15-21 Sep): Make a contact on Morse code! {#week38}

### Week 39 (22-28 Sep): Make a 2-way contact with an output power of 100 mW or less. {#week39}

### Week 40 (29 Sep - 5 Oct): Which QSLing methods do you use, physical and electronic? {#week40}

A simple one this week, and the answer is: all of them!

My Wavelog server dutifully uploads details of all my contacts to LotW, QRZ, eQSL and Clublog. (Whether all of these are really considered QSL services, I have no idea&mdash;either way, all the details get uploaded and matched against other people's.)

I also offer physical cards, both direct and via the RSGB bureau. For the first few years of my amateur radio experience, I wasn't bothered about physical cards, but I signed up for the bureau around October last year in case the Scout group wanted to do QSL cards for Jamboree on the Air. Then, [Ham Challenge Week 1](/blog/52-week-ham-radio-challenge-roundup-weeks-1-4/#week1) got me designing my own card, and shortly after, I received by first ever set of cards via the Bureau. So then I had no choice but to get my own made!

My default, like most people, is not to send a physical card. But I'm always happy to send them on request via email or Clublog OQRS, and of course I will always send one back when I receive one unprompted.

I've also decided to request physical cards for particularly unusual contacts, if the other party offers them, e.g. unusual DXCC entities, very long range contacts, transatlantic park-to-parks, etc.

That's all for this round-up, see you in early November for the results of weeks 41 to 44!
