Sometimes, outdoor radio is about [long self-supported hikes](/blog/christchurch-pota-rove-eight-parks-in-eight-hours/) with [big rucksacks](/blog/new-pota-kit-for-2025/) and [madcap races against time](/blog/radar-rally-report-spring-2025/). Sometimes it's about [places you'll likely never visit again](/blog/pota-bota-activation-report-greenham-common/), where failure isn't an option. Sometimes you just need to bring the power, whether for [popular activations where many people will want to call](/blog/purbeck-pota-rove/#durlston), [times when you need a huge number of contacts](/blog/pota-activation-report-holt-heath/) or [chasing park-to-park DX](/blog/pota-activation-report-hengistbury-head/). There's equipment for that.

But sometimes, outdoor radio isn't like that. Sometimes it's just a lovely day sat on a beach or in a park, and 10 QSOs would be a nice bonus.

For those days, this is my current "casual" outdoor radio kit.

The radio is a [Xiegu X6100](https://www.eham.net/reviews/view-product/15211), protected in an old [GoPro Travel hard case](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/135763578070) (shout out to folks in [this thread](https://groups.io/g/xiegu-x6100/topic/protective_case/95427051) for suggesting it). The exact model of case isn't made any more, but it's a better fit than the current ones; I tracked mine down on eBay for a fiver. (The radio was from eBay too. I sure would love to splash out Â£1000+ on a brand new IC-705, but that stage of my life has not yet arrived.)

The rest of the kit inside the bag is as per my [hotel room HF adventure](): A Sotabeams [Bandspringer Midi](https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/bandspringerMidi40m30m20m/) "random wire" antenna, [INIU 20000mAh power bank](https://uk-main.iniushop.com/products/iniu-p62-e1-power-bank-smallest-20000mah-65w), and a [12V "trigger cable"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/DSD-TECH-MagicConn-SH-CP12A-Cable-12V-Black/dp/B0B9FDZX7P) to power the radio from the power bank and therefore achieve 10W output rather than 5W when I need to.

The bag itself is a [Yuhan camera bag](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07PVM6PDC) which has some nice internal dividers to keep things separate, although not strictly necessary here. The last piece of the kit, strapped to the top of the bag with a couple of carabiners and two hair bands, is a [Spirit of Air 4m Pocket Pole](http://www.spiritofair.co.uk/pocket_poles.htm) with the [stake and bag kit](http://www.spiritofair.co.uk/10263.htm).

Today, I decided to head back to Hengistbury Head to try out the kit. This time I wouldn't be chasing transatlantic park-to-park contacts, but instead just finding a nice spot on the beach and grabbing a few QSOs where I could on 40 metres.

As well as being two Parks on the Air references, [GB-1727 Christchurch Harbour SSSI](https://pota.app/#/park/GB-1727) and the newly-added [GB-4696 Hengistbury Head Scenic Site](https://pota.app/#/park/GB-4696), my activation location also qualifies for Bunkers on the Air as [G/B-1100](https://bunkerwiki.org/?s=B/G-1100). I was also activating for Beaches on the Air for the first time, as [12413 Hengistbury West beach](https://www.beachesontheair.com/beaches/bournemouth-hengistbury-west). (I'm not sure why it's taken me this long to do my first beach!)
