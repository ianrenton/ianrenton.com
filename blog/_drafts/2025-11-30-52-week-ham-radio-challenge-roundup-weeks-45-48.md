If you've read [the first post in this series](/blog/52-week-ham-radio-challenge-roundup-weeks-1-4/) or are playing along yourself, you'll be aware of the [52 Week Ham Radio Challenge](https://hamchallenge.org/). If not, hit up that link for the details!

This post covers the challenges from weeks 45-48, which were:

<ol start="45">
  <li><a href="#week45">Fix something that is broken.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week46">Write a useful computer program!</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week47">Submit an idea for the Ham Challenge 2026!</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week48">Transmit a QRSS signal on the HF bands</a></li>
</ol>

### Week 45 (3-9 Nov): Fix something that is broken. {#week45}

### Week 46 (10-16 Nov): Write a useful computer program! {#week46}

Honestly, I couldn't think of anything to write in this *specific* week, but I think I've done enough over the year to sign this one off. As well as countless updates to older software, I wrote the following this year:

* [POTA New Park Finder](https://newparks.m0trt.radio/) (development started in February)
* [QSO Map Tool](https://qsomap.m0trt.radio/) (development started in April)
* [UKBota n-fer Finder](https://github.com/ianrenton/ukbota-nfer-finder) (written in May)

(I also wrote the code for the [Billy Bass Sat Nav](https://ianrenton.com/projects/bluetooth-bass/) this year, but I don't think that qualifies as "useful"!)

### Week 47 (17-23 Nov): Submit an idea for the Ham Challenge 2026! {#week47}

### Week 48 (24-30 Nov): Transmit a QRSS signal on the HF bands {#week48}

That's all for this round-up, see you just after Christmas for the results of weeks 49 to 52!
