Win Green, the highest point in Cranbourne Chase. From the small copse of trees on top of this hill, you can see for miles in every direction; to Stourhead in the north, towards Southampton in the east, and to the south, all the way to home and the sea.

Unlike many of the other spots I've talked about during my amateur radio adventures, I have no particular childhood memories here, and little to say about the history of this particular corner of the world. It remains special to me though, because this was [where I started](/blog/my-first-easiest-and-last-sota/). One year ago today was [OARC SOTA Day 2024](https://wiki.oarc.uk/oarc-sota-day-2024). Late morning, as the sun baked the hilltop and Spitfires roared overhead, we unrolled our picnic blanket, set up an antenna, and tentatively took our first steps into the world of portable amateur radio operations.

It was my first time using amateur radio equipment outside the house, my first Summit on the Air, my first Park on the Air, even my first time on HF Single Sideband. It was just an excuse to test some equipment, really. But the first few contacts came in, slowly but surely, and with them a rush of adrenaline; a joy at finding a new thing that I loved. I was hooked.

Today, I stand here again. The rush is still there, the anxiety and the joy.

One year later, I'm back for my third SOTA activation. Oh yeah, and my *eighty-fourth* POTA activation.

So what does the next year hold in store for me?

Over the next few months, I'm hoping to do:

* A *kite portable* activation with Stu M7UTS, on a windy hill somewhere in Dorset
* A six-spot, three-operator rove around Portland, including the 11-reference spot from the [Worked Everything, Everywhere, All At Once Award](/projects/worked-everything-award/) and continuing down to Portland Bill for [International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend](https://illw.net/).
* Another 10-park rove, this time 10 individual parks, all on foot in a 10-mile round walk
* And another successful Jamboree on the Air with the Scouts.

Further afield, one day I'd like to do:

* My first overseas activation
* My first Maritime Mobile activation
* Visits to Plymouth and Sandown to reach the [Worked Everything, Everywhere, All At Once Award's](/projects/worked-everything-award/) 21-reference spot and a 6-program spot
* Hiking the South Downs, taking in 15 POTA references in 10 days.

Fingers crossed, a long and exciting future of outdoor radio adventures awaits.

I'll finish as I always do, with a huge thank-you to all my contacts over the past year&mdash;all *2731* of you. **todo update** None of this would have been possible without you being there, from Alaska to Indonesia to just down the road, sat by a radio taking my call. Thank you so much.

Here's to another year!
