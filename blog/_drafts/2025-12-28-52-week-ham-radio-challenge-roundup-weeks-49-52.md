If you've read [the first post in this series](/blog/52-week-ham-radio-challenge-roundup-weeks-1-4/) or are playing along yourself, you'll be aware of the [52 Week Ham Radio Challenge](https://hamchallenge.org/). If not, hit up that link for the details!

This post covers the final four weeks of challenges, weeks 49-52, which were:

<ol start="49">
  <li><a href="#week49">Clean up your shack and post the most curious item you found.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week50">Receive an APRS message or beacon</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week51">Write something about ham radio with public impact.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week52">Create an Infographic or Webcomic!</a></li>
</ol>

### Week 49 (1-7 Dec): Clean up your shack and post the most curious item you found. {#week49}

### Week 50 (8-14 Dec): Receive an APRS message or beacon {#week50}

### Week 51 (15-21 Dec): Write something about ham radio with public impact. {#week51}

### Week 52 (22-28 Dec): Create an Infographic or Webcomic! {#week52}

That's all for this round-up, and with it, the end of the 52-week Ham Challenge 2025. I think I can claim success on XX out of 52 weeks, not a bad result! Thanks for following along with my journey to broaden my radio horizons this year, and thanks especially to Fabian DJ5CW for running the challenge. It's been great running through these challenges in synchrony with others; discussing our wins and our losses together online. I hope to see you all again in 2026&mdash;Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
