If you've read [last month's post](/blog/52-week-ham-radio-challenge-roundup-weeks-1-4/) or are playing along yourself, you'll be aware of the [52 Week Ham Radio Challenge](https://hamchallenge.org/). If not, hit up that link for the details!

This post covers the challenges from weeks 5-8, which were:

<ol start="5">
  <li><a href="#week5">Update your profile on QRZ.com, HamQTH.com, etc.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week6">Take part in a contest!</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week7">Find out which DXpeditions are active this week.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week8">Encourage someone to take their ham radio license exam</a></li>
</ol>

### Week 5 (27 Jan-2 Feb): Update your profile on QRZ.com, HamQTH.com, etc. {#week5}

This was an easy one, and nothing much to say about it. I had already updated both [my QRZ profile](https://www.qrz.com/db/m0trt) and [my HamQTH profile](https://www.hamqth.com/M0TRT) with a new POTA photo and some changes to the details back in December, so there wasn't much to do. 

I did add a POTA widget to both though, [this one](https://pota-stats.wd4dan.net/?help) created by WD4DAN.

### Week 6 (3-9 Feb): Take part in a contest! {#week6}

This week took a little more effort. I'm not much of a contester, having only tried an FT4 contest once, and [exploited CQ WW SSB for personal gain](/blog/pota-activation-report-hengistbury-head/). According to the [Contest Calendar](https://www.contestcalendar.com/weeklycont.php) my choice was either CW, 80/160m bands, contests focussed on other countries, or [CQ WPX RTTY](https://cqwpxrtty.com/).

I chose the latter; Saturday promised to be a cold and rainy day, and I wanted something I could casually work around my cooking and chores while also letting my wife study in peace. As you can imagine, between this schedule, a 20-30W power limit and a single wire antenna, I was absolutely not in this hoping to win anything. In fact if I didn't come dead last, I would consider it a good result!

I'd never done RTTY before, so I had a quick practice on Friday night, followed by setting up [some macros](/files/blog/2025/contest-macros.mdf) following online advice. I then got stuck in on Saturday morning, and followed it up now and again throughout the day when I had the chance.

The 40m band morning and evening were fairly productive, as was the 20m band all day. I did spend a while trying 10m, and grabbing Brazil was nice, but with my limited equipment compared to many contesters I struggled to be heard over the longer distances.

I made it to 50 contacts before the point our friends would start showing up for dinner, and chucked an extra 3 in there just in case any of the previous ones were wrongly logged.

All in all it was a good experience, despite having computer/logging trouble several times which probably annoyed the more experienced contesters I was contacting. Would I do it again? I'm not sure. Even though part of the reason I like outdoor radio is that the QSOs tend to be more protocol than ragchew, I think contesting takes it too far in that direction for me, and it's nice to share more than just a few numbers.

## Week 7 (10-16 Feb): Find out which DXpeditions are active this week {#week7}

I've never really thought much about DXpeditions before, much less tried to contact any of them&mdash;I have enough trouble getting through a normal special event station pile-up, let alone one that half the ham radio world is trying to talk to.

After someone on fedi mentioned it, I checked out the [NG3K website list](https://ng3k.com/Misc/adxo.html) of ongoing and planned DXpeditions, which aggregates from a number of sources. There were more than I expected, with 18 in the list covering the weekend of 15-16th February. While I did a perfunctory check of some of the spots, I had other priorities so didn't manage to contact any of them.

If I'm honest, I'm kind of torn on the concept of DXpeditions, especially after finding out that [some of them have cost north of *a million dollars*](https://mastodon.radio/@ve3qbz/113923510656446911). On the one hand, great for the participants having a cool adventure whether or not ham radio is involved; on the other, there's something uneasily colonial about a bunch of comparatively rich white guys rocking up to a remote island chain, largely for their own fame and often [without it being clear that the locals want them there](https://www.dx-world.net/sv1ga-a-mt-athos/).

A million dollars could buy a lot of equipment and training for local people instead, who might become interested in amateur radio and put their remote location "on the air" permanently. But no-one seems to fund-raise for that.

## Week 8 (17-23 Feb): Encourage someone to take their ham radio license exam {#week8}

Well, a pretty easy one this week. My occasional POTA logging assistant has been talking about getting her Foundation licence for about 9 months now, so I have yet again reminded her to read the book and practice with me.

That's it for this round-up, see you at the end of March for weeks 9 to 12!
