If you've read [last month's post](/blog/52-week-ham-radio-challenge-roundup-weeks-1-4/) or are playing along yourself, you'll be aware of the [52 Week Ham Radio Challenge](https://hamchallenge.org/). If not, hit up that link for the details!

This post covers the challenges from weeks 5-8, which were:

<ol start="5">
  <li><a href="#week1">Update your profile on QRZ.com, HamQTH.com, etc.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week2">Take part in a contest!</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week3">Find out which DXpeditions are active this week.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week4">Encourage someone to take their ham radio license exam</a></li>
</ol>

### Week 1 (27 Jan-2 Feb): Update your profile on QRZ.com, HamQTH.com, etc. {#week1}

This was an easy one, and nothing much to say about it. I had already updated both [my QRZ profile](https://www.qrz.com/db/m0trt) and [my HamQTH profile](https://www.hamqth.com/M0TRT) with a new POTA photo and some changes to the details back in December, so there wasn't much to do. 

I did add a POTA widget to both though, [this one](https://pota-stats.wd4dan.net/?help) created by WD4DAN.

### Weed 2 (3-9 Feb): Take part in a contest!

This week took a little more effort. I'm not much of a contester, having only tried an FT4 contest once, and [exploited CQ WW SSB for personal gain](/blog/pota-activation-report-hengistbury-head/). According to the [Contest Calendar](https://www.contestcalendar.com/weeklycont.php) my choice was either CW, 80/160m bands, contests focussed on other countries, or [CQ WPX RTTY](https://cqwpxrtty.com/).

I chose the latter; Saturday promised to be a cold and rainy day, and I wanted something I could casually work around my cooking and chores while also letting my wife study in peace. As you can imagine, between this schedule, a 20-30W power limit and a single wire antenna, I was absolutely not in this hoping to win anything. In fact if I didn't come dead last, I would consider it a good result!

I'd never done RTTY before, so I had a quick practice on Friday night, followed by setting up [some macros](/files/blog/2025/contest-macros.mdf) following online advice. I then got stuck in on Saturday morning, and followed it up now and again throughout the day when I had the chance.

The 40m band morning and evening were fairly productive, as was the 20m band all day. I did spend a while trying 10m, and grabbing Brazil was nice, but with my limited equipment compared to many contesters I struggled to be heard over the longer distances.

I made it to 50 contacts before the point our friends would start showing up for dinner, and chucked an extra 3 in there just in case any of the previous ones were wrongly logged.

All in all it was a good experience, despite having computer/logging trouble several times which probably annoyed the more experienced contesters I was contacting. Would I do it again? I'm not sure. Even though part of the reason I like outdoor radio is that the QSOs tend to be more protocol than ragchew, I think contesting takes it too far in that direction for me, and it's nice to share more than just a few numbers.

## TODO

That's it for this round-up, see you at the end of February for weeks 5 to 8!
