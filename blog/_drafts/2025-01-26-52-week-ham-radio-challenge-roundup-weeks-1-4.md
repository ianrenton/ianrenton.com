A new amateur radio activity for this year that you may not be aware of is the ["52 Week Ham Radio Challenge"](https://hamchallenge.org/). Coordinated via the website and via a Mastodon bot, it provides 52 challenges for 2025, approximately one a week, for players to work on alongside each other.

The first four weeks' challenges were:

1. Create a QSL card design
2. Monitor as many NCDXF IARU beacons in one week as possible
3. Work another continent on 80m or 160m
4. Research the history of your callsign

If you'd like to take part, head to the website for the rules and if you have a fediverse account, to see how to track your progress using the bot. There's no need to do them in a specific order or wait until a specific week, but it's fun to do the same activities alongside others, and the bot regularly shares people's progress.

Here's how I got on with weeks 1 to 4!

### Week 1 (1-5 Jan): Create a QSL card design

This was one I had been putting off for ages, so I'm glad it came up! Physical QSL cards are rarely done anymore, and especially not for my main activities (POTA/WWFF and playing with digimodes), but I would love to receive one someday and would love to start sending them on request too. I did register with the RSGB QSL bureau in case Scout troops wanted to do QSL cards for Jamboree on the Air, but no-one asked and none came, which is a shame.

Still, it's good to be prepared with a design that I could print in case I receive one or someone requests one, so week 1 of the challenge was a good excuse.

I started by researching the available printing services, both bespoke QSL cards such as [UX5UO print](https://www.ux5uoqsl.com/) and [QSL Concept](https://qslconcept.com/uk/), and general postcard printing services like [Vistaprint](https://www.vistaprint.co.uk). My main goal here was to figure out the size, resolution and formats that would be required.

For a typical A6 card of 148mm by 105mm, printers typically ask for a few millimetres of "bleed" area around the design, to ensure no white edges are left when the cards are cut. I therefore designed my card to the 151 x 108mm size recommended by a number of services. Colour front and black & white back (like a typical postcard) seems to be a common setup, so I designed around that as well, ensuring that the photo I chose for the front was at 600dpi for a high quality appearance in print.

For the front I chose one of my favourite shots of Bournemouth beach, as I always like to see photos on QRZ/HamQTH of where others live, and hopefully the recipients of my QSL cards would like to see where I live as well. I included the logo of the RSGB alongside those of Parks on the Air and World-Wide Flora & Fauna to represent my main ham radio interests.

On the back, I included all the usual QSL details, along with a space to write in details of portable operations since that's my main activity.

This was the result:

I've not yet sent these off to a printer, but might do soon. Then the long wait for someone to ask for one or send me their own begins!

### Week 2 (6-12 Jan): Monitor as many NCDXF IARU beacons in one week as possible

This was a challenge I was less keen on. It's great that these beacons are out there, and live monitoring of propagation conditions is very cool, but I didn't find it a lot of fun to be listening to the noise for 10-20 minutes at a time in the hope of picking out a quiet burst of Morse code that's too quick for me to copy properly. The beacons only operate on the 20 metre band and up, so by the time evening came and I have some time for radio, the bands were closed and I heard almost nothing. I think I heard the occasional blip from CS3B, but that's it.

However, midweek I spotted [a post by Paul, PA3DSB](https://mastodon.radio/@PA3DSB/113783741321639970) which mentioned the [Faros software](http://www.dxatlas.com/faros/) by Alex, VE3NEA. I decided to try that out instead, leaving it running during the daytime to see what it could pick up.

This was much more successful than listening by ear in the evenings, and the History function provided a nice way to visualise how propagation on the higher bands varied during the day.

Overall it looked like I was getting decent daytime reception of CS3B, OH2B, 4U1UN and 4X6TU on 20 metres, with the higher bands appearing mid-morning and tailing off through the afternoon as you would expect. All bands up to 10m came in, as winter during a peak solar activity year is a good combination for the higher hands, although of course winter gives us less time to play on them before dusk takes them away again.

I also saw very occasional receptions of RR90, VR2B, ZS6DN and LU4AA on certain bands only, which I definitely would never have found without Faros doing the work for me!

The NCDXF beacon map is shown below, annotated with a green tick for beacons I received well, a brown tilde for beacons I received less well but at least once during the day, and a red cross for those I did not receive at all.

### Week 3 (13-19 Jan): Work another continent on 80m or 160m

This was going to be a tricky one. I don't have an antenna resonant anywhere longer than 40 metres, and trying to tune my home end-fed random wire antenna to 80 metres resulted in a sequence of unhappy noises and a "high SWR" warning.

### Week 4 (20-26 Jan): Research the history of your callsign
