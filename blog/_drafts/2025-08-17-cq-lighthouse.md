This one had been in the calendar for a while. The third week in August is [International Lighthouse & Lightship weekend](https://illw.net/), an annual activity where amateur radio operators set up portable stations around the coast to celebrate the history of our local beacons.

The obvious choice for me was Portland Bill.

It's been a long time since I lived on the island, but various things have taken me back many times over the years, and often close by this, one of the Dorset coast's most recognisable landmarks.

Most ILLW stations seem to be "proper" club affairs, setting up tents and presenting the amateur radio hobby to visitors with prior agreements with the lighthouse staff. That's not really my style though&mdash;I'd much rather just rock up with a radio and antenna, and see what happens.

But also I like to make my life needlessly difficult, so I decided to also hit up *every POTA reference on the island* on the way to the lighthouse.

Oh, and this time Stu M7UTS and Joe M7JSE came along too. So it was going to be a five-location, three-operator rove across the island, taking in five POTA parks, one WWFF park, three bunkers, 12 castles, and two WAB squares, starting at 9 AM and finishing the day down by the lighthouse.

Alright, here we go.

### 0800-0900Z: Tout Quarry

We parked in the free car park at New Ground, a central location for the first three locations of the day, then headed down past the Portland Heights hotel and over the road to the former Tout Quarry, now a "sculpture park". There's a few sculptures dotted around, but as with most of the island's disused quarries what it mostly offers is winding paths through giant piles of rock, thinly speckled with vegetation.

The wind was chilly and stronger than I'd hoped for, so we spent a while trying to find somewhere to hide from it while still having a decent spot to raise an antenna. We settled on a north-facing outcrop with an outstanding view of Weymouth and Chesil Beach.

Like most of today's parks, [GB-4187 Tout Quarry Sculpture Park](https://pota.app/#/park/GB-4187) was a relatively new reference and had only been activated once before. And although we didn't specifically visit any of them during this first activation, the corner of the park we set up in is within range of four World Castles Award references: G-01111 Drill Hall, G-01116 Portland Cenotaph, G-01128 Verne High Angle Battery, and G-04304 HAA Gun Battery (P3 Verne).

It took us a few minutes to get going here, with several operators not understanding that there were three of us, sadly penalising the M7s who I often handed over to only to find that our QSO partner had already spun the dial.

Nevertheless, just over half an hour later we all had at least 10 QSOs in our log as far as POTA is concerned, helped by Leszek SQ9MDF and Uli DD8DR, both of whom were on 3-fer activations and worked us park-to-park.

It was time to pack up and head back over the road to our next spot of the day.
