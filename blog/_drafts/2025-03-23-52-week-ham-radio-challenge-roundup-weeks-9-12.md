If you've read [the first post in this series](/blog/52-week-ham-radio-challenge-roundup-weeks-1-4/) or are playing along yourself, you'll be aware of the [52 Week Ham Radio Challenge](https://hamchallenge.org/). If not, hit up that link for the details!

This post covers the challenges from weeks 9-12, which were:

<ol start="9">
  <li><a href="#week9">Try to work an FM repeater on 10m</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week10">Listen to an amateur radio satellite</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week11">Receive a weather satellite image</a></li>
  <li><a href="#week12">Make a contact with an "unusual" antenna.</a></li>
</ol>

### Week 9 (24 Feb-2 Mar): Try to work an FM repeater on 10m {#week9}

This one I attempted while out on a POTA activation, so [you can read all about it here](/blog/pota-activation-report-luscombe-valley/). Unfortunately I didn't complete the challenge&mdash;while I did eventually hear VE3MMX in Ontario loud and clear, I didn't get the chance to talk in as I was already tired and grumpy by that point&mdash;not the best of operating conditions.

I might have a go at this one later in the year, perhaps in September when transatlantic 10m returns and the days are a bit longer and warmer.

### Week 10 (3-9 Mar): Listen to an amateur radio satellite {#week10}

A week of travel for work didn't leave any time for radio until the weekend, and unfortunately the passes of satellites with VHF/UHF repeaters were mostly at night. But I had a few attempts at this one in a few different ways.

On Saturday 8th at 0845z, I listened in for the pass of SO-50 over my location, but unfortunately heard nothing. I wondered if my equipment might be too limited, being a fixed base station colinear antenna on the side of the house, but though it might be less than ideal for satellites overhead, it should have no problem at least receiving something during part of the pass.

Somewhat disheartened, I decided instead to see what I could hear through a WebSDR. I ended up listening to QO-100 / Es'hail2 [via the Goonhilly SDR](https://eshail.batc.org.uk/nb/) around 1700z. I'd heard of QO-100 before but never quite twigged that it was different to the various polar orbiting satellites with their repeaters. QO-100 is in geosynchronous orbit and its repeater has over 8MHz of bandwidth&mdash;it's so huge it has its own band plan! It's very cool, and working this satellite is now firmly on my to-do list of future radio adventures.

On the SSB section of the band I copied YI1YJK, F5CAC and F4GFA calling CQ. Sadly YI1YJK had no takers, I wish I could have worked him as it would have been my first QSO with Iraq. I also heard a number of long ragchews in the SSB section in a variety of languages&mdash;I copied the callsign of IW0NMJ but did not hang around listening to someone else's chat for long enough to copy any others.

I also copied&mdash;I assume!&mdash;F5HAA via this interesting pattern on the waterfall:

What mode is that?!

Although strictly I'd dragged the challenge out for longer than a week, I did spend a few evenings during the following few days dashing to my radio when the ISS went over. I struggled to copy the QSOs above the noise, and I don't have a radio with dual watch set up, so I decided against trying to make a call of my own.

However, around 2050z on Monday 10th I clearly copied G0FMZ, and at 2140z on Tuesday 11th I copied most of a QSO between F4BLE and F4CQA, and a CQ call from EA4SF.

A six-minute scramble for contacts as the satellite passes overhead suits me fine, with my preference for brief bursts of protocol rather than long ragchews, so this is definitely something I will have a proper go at with better equipment in future.

### Week 11 (10-16 Mar): Receive a weather satellite image {#week11}

This one unfortunately was another failure. I don't have any way to connect my VHF radio up to my computer, and nor do I have an antenna which is going to give good results here. This one didn't interest me that much, so I passed on spending money on kit just to achieve it.

I may be a little spoiled in this area, because I've actually spent several years receiving weather satellite images in the past&mdash;way back in secondary school. I was a member of the "Met Office" club which, to be honest, was less about our enthusiasm for weather and more of a social club for nerds.

This was the late 90s and on a school budget, so our receiving capability was unimpressive by today's standards. But several times a day, our Windows 3.1 PC would receive a visible light or IR image, and we would dutifully print it out on our very noisy dot matrix printer. It's a shame I was less interested in radio at the time; unfortunately I don't recall anything about our receiver or antenna.

### Week 12 (17-23 Mar): Make a contact with an "unusual" antenna. {#week12}
