Well, here we are, four hours from the end of this term's Uni work.  And, even now, it doesn't feel special yet...  

Not a lot's happened in real life since yesterday, but it feels very definitely otherwise - an awful lot happened in yesterday's World of Darkness game.  Physically and mentally - not only was Malachai within a few seconds of death, but the whole Shelley thing has suddenly speeded up an awful lot.  I guess that's just the way it is, but it's still a little fast from Malachai's point of view.  I guess, when I think about it, I *do* have enough experience to know how he would feel.  (Oh, and he owes Shelley his life now, which will make things even more odd...)  

Anyway, enough roleplaying talk, and on with the Photonics Labs.  Not long left, now...
