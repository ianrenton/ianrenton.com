My life fell apart.  Again.  Worse this time.  

I thought that at last, even though I was still unsure what was happening, there were some things I understood about the way my life was heading.  Turns out, of course, I didn't understand anything.  And I still don't.  

But it's okay, I can start my life again from tomorrow.  

You know, I said something quite similar to that only twenty-four hours ago...  

*"Well I know, I miss more than hit  <br/>
With a face that was launched to sink<br/>  
An' I seldom feel, the bright relief  <br/><br/>
It's been the Worst Day Since Yesterday  <br/>
If there's one thing I have said  <br/>
Is that the dreams I once had, now lay in bed<br/>  
As the four winds blow, my wits through the door  <br/><br/>
It's been the Worst Day Since Yesterday  <br/>
Fallin' down to you sweet ground  <br/>
Where the flowers they bloom  <br/>
It's there I'll be found  <br/>
Hurry back to me, my wild calling<br/>  <br/>
It's been the Worst Day Since Yesterday<br/> 
Though these wounds have seen no wars  <br/>
Except for the scars I have ignored  <br/>
And this endless crutch, well it's never enough<br/><br/>  
It's been the Worst Day Since Yesterday  <br/>
Hell says hello, well it's time to I should go<br/>  
To pastures green, that I've yet to see  <br/>
Hurry back to me, my wild calling  <br/>
It's been the Worst Day Since Yesterday"<br/>
