Thank you to everyone who turned up and made the Bournemouth Meet shiny and awesome, even though we didn't manage to get much sunshine or barbecueing done!  It was awesome to see you all again.  Hopefully there'll be another one again next year, and maybe it might actually feel like July then too!  

It feels really odd, suddenly being in an empty house though.  And work tomorrow will be weird...  

Question for the Soton kiddies:  What's next?  August has birthdays for Claire and Rhiannon; is there anything big planned for us lot?
