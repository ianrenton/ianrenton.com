So, the post-party drama has hit as it was always bound to.  Beltane never ceases to be... interesting.  Still, there remains little to be said that I haven't already said to the relevant people (with one exception, to be dealt with tomorrow).  Now a day has passed since the party, life feels sane again - and god knows I need life to be sane if I'm to make it through the next few days - but I'm no less optimistic than I was.  The drama never ceases, of course (to the few of you to whom this makes sense, I believe we're probably now on Chobits S) but still I believe things will turn out for the best.  

And no matter what happens, whatever we do...  we're still only human.
