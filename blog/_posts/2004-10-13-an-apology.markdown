My apologies for the being tired and sitting-huddled-up-in-the-corner bits of my behaviour at the party last night.  I thought it was just overtiredness, but since I woke up this morning with streaming eyes, a runny nose and a sore throat, I guess I was kinda' ill (I blame the Freshers).  Not that I'm good at social situations normally, anyway, but I think I could have done better than I did last night ^_^;;
