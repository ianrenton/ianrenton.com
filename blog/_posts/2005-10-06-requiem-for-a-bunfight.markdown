That's it then.  In such a short amount of time, it was over.  The hyped-up state of caffeine and alcohol and sugar and stress and adrenaline has faded, and it dawns on me that I will never again help to organise a bunfight.  Still, it was a success.  So much of a success.  Page after page of new members signing up, flier after flier in their hundreds disappearing into freshers' hands...  (To quote a character from Comic Party Revolution and presumably by extension 2chan, "member get".)  

Today has been...  Truly shiny.
