Did I, after all, enjoy that...?  

The first two weeks of the course, boring, lots of work, no fun, barely even sunshine, bad food, and we all complained.  

And now at last, week three is over... laziness, sunshine, playing frisbee, drinking, and the masked ball... seeing friends but it seeming as if we'd never left Pershore between the weeks...  

But now we have. We've all left, and we're not coming back any more. But is that really a good thing? I used to hate Pershore, but now... I'm not so sure...
