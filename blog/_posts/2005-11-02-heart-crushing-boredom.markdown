Today's been great, up until now...  Non-stop interaction with people since the moment I got up, a great game session and generally lots of having fun.  And now it's the evening.  No-one's around, wanting to do anything.  Everyone's too busy with work or things that don't concern me.  And so, I'm just sitting around on the 'net hoping something fun might happen.  

I just... want to spend as much time as possible with as many people as possible.  

And boredom...  Boredom hurts.  

Over time, I'm getting more and more impulsive, more and more led by my emotions, less and less concerned with mundane reality, and boredom is starting to hurt...  

I know what kind of thing has those traits, I know what that might imply.  But am I allowed to believe that...?
