title: Dreams of the World
---

The red and brown leaves blew in the air,<br/>
as dreams and memories flowed past on the wind.<br/>
Walking slowly through the frigid stillness,<br/>
fighting the sudden coldness of the world.<br/>
But in time the flowers came again,<br/>
to shine in the sunlight of a gentle morning.<br/>
And now the lazy sunshine days are here again,<br/>
our world a glittering jewel in the light.<br/>
Yet soon, the western winds will blow once more,<br/>
and we will be whisked away on a merry-go-round of dreams.<br/>

*"But, for certainty, back then<br/>
We loved so many yet hated so much<br/>
We hurt others and were hurt ourselves Yet even then we ran like the wind<br/>
Whilst our laughter echoed<br/>
Under cerulean skies..."*<br/>
&mdash; from the opening to Chrono Cross.
