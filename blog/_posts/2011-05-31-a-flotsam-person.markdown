Whilst walking the night-time streets of Guildford, Eric remarked to me that it was a place that felt permanent; a place where one could put down roots.  My home, and now hers, stands in complete contrast.  Bournemouth is a new town, founded two hundred years ago as a seaside resort -- which it still is.

She lectured me on the joys of her old inland town, with its stone walls and canals.  I asked why one would want to put down roots, when you could have a beach instead?

She branded me a 'flotsam person', and that was that.

But I suppose I am, really.  I carry things that remind me of the sea, so that I feel at home wherever I go.  The feeling of being tied to a place, a town with history, isn't for me.  Like the sand that drifts forever eastwards, despite the groynes that try to stop it, I'm happy anywhere near the sea.  I love the feel of transient beaches, transient lives, forever in motion.  Years come and go, bringing with them the ebb and flow of people -- students, summer students, tourists.

I am a flotsam person, a driftwood person, happy wherever I can wash ashore and sit on sand as the waves lap against my feet.
