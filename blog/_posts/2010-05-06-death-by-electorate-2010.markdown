For any of you wanting a reason to be in A&E; by 6am tomorrow, we proudly present: the Election Results Drinking Game!

Simply tune in to a live broadcast of your choice by 10pm tonight, and...

  * Every time the Labour party wins a seat, take a sip of Aftershock.
  * Every time the Tories win a seat, take a sip of Blue Cura√ßao.
  * Every time the Lib Dems win a seat, take a sip of brandy.
  * Every time the Green party wins a seat, take a sip of absinthe.
  * Every time UKIP wins a seat, read their manifesto, then make and drink a Purple Rain to get over the shock.
  * Every time the BNP wins a seat, emigrate.

There are 649 seats up for grabs, so good luck and try to avoid an untimely demise!
