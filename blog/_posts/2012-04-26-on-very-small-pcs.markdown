With my recent acquisition of a [Bluetooth keyboard](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005GUJH4O/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00) added to the [PowerSkin](http://www.powerskin.co.uk/), my phone has completed its transition from thin, attractive polycarbonate slate to the monstrous assault on product design you see before you.

Or so I would have said in the dim and technologically distant days of 2010.

But really, I don't have a giant ugly phone -- because the other day, an incoming call interrupted my SSH session and I was briefly confused as to why someone was calling me on my computer.

I don't have a giant phone -- I have a really tiny laptop, with a battery that lasts two days.

Did the future happen while I wasn't looking *again*?
