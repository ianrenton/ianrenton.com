*"Walk along the path of changing seasons<br/>
Showers of leaves fill the air<br/>
The dark night is closing in<br/>
Cold wind blows through your hairâ€¦<br/>
Snow ices the ground with its touch<br/>
At midwinter the darkness abounds<br/>
The warm glow burns inside<br/>
Whilst the dark and ice are all around."*

...(unfinished)
