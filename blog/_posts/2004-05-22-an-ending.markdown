I wonder... how did a mere forty-eight hours become long enough for a chapter to be a story in its own right?  

I guess the feeling that all our experiences are woven together in some story, somewhere... I guess it takes over, sometimes.  When the wind blows, and the pages flick past faster and faster...  

I suppose we all need things like this sometimes, to open our eyes...  But as yet, they're open just a fraction, the eyes of a daydreamer in the sunlight.  

One day perhaps, they'll be open wide.  And then the sunlight will sparkle in them, a shine beyond beauty...  

So how does this chapter end - a happy ending?  I hope so...  But if that's not it, even if it takes all the energy I have, I'll make it a happy ending.  Because that's what any story, no matter how short, deserves.  

The future is full of soft grass, and pure sky, and sunlight...  

<i>Y'know... it kinda' feels good to write this kind of entry, like I always used to, rather than just writing down what I did each day...  I'm sure my random spouting of pseudo-poetry probably annoys people reading the journal though, so my apologies for today's entry!</i>
