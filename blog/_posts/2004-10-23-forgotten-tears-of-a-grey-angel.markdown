A single "mood" entry doesn't really do these emotions justice.  Right now I'm happy, sad, relieved, frustrated and lost, with an unhealthy dollop of self-loathing added in.  

You know, there were days when I thought being in some kind of bizarre love triangle was weird.  Nowadays I'm not sure what kind of shape is going on, but I think it's ceased to abide by Euclidean geometry.  And I'm in there somewhere - off to the side, connected only by grey lines.  Dotted ones.  With arrows on, that only point away from me.  

Things I've learned today:  

* I'm hopeless at psychology.  It seems as though everyone understands me completely within minutes of meeting me, and yet I only ever read people wrongly.  
* Lines are blurred, always.  I don't think there's ever such a thing as definite knowledge, or a definite answer to the kind of questions I desperately try to ask.  
* Hard as I might try, I can't be everything to everyone.  Even being something to someone is a state I've yet to reach.  
* Emotions interfere destructively.  Having many at once results in feeling horribly unemotional.  
* You can set custom lists of friends to set who can see LiveJournal entries and who can't.  This is the first time I've ever protected an entry, and I have a horrible feeling that I might have to again, one day.
