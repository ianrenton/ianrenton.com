(Yes, I'm afraid this is about the same situation as all my protected entries are these days...)  

I just read her latest blog post, the protected one entitled "Pining".  

I never did stand a chance, did I?  It's probably best if I forget the whole thing, just like I managed to previously.  But...  This isn't quite the same.  Previously I always knew my wishes were unattainable, so letting go didn't seem such a bad thing.  But this time, when I thought that maybe there was a possibility...  Now even considering giving up hurts more than I can describe.  

And yet I guess I have to.  I shouldn't be sad, should I?  But I'm crying nonetheless.  

That, I guess, is telling me that there's some indelible emotion in my mind, telling me that I shouldn't give up no matter what, that giving up would only prove me to be shallow and weak-willed.  

I have no idea what to do, I really don't.  I don't know which I would find least painful, or even if the path of least pain is one I would want to tread...
