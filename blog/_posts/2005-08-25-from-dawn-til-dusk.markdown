I left home before dawn today, and now the sun is setting over the horizon as I return thirteen hours later.  It's been a long day, no doubt, but a successful one.  The conference was a fantastic success, and I learned a lot - including about a plan for creating a single national (or international) database for neuroscience data.  I'm not sure if it's going to be possible for someone like me, but I'm going to try and get at lest slightly involved with it.  It sounds pretty exciting, and the technical details that need sorting out are exactly the kind of things I'm good at - data formats, metadata, data security, stuff like that.  

Got a free lunch, too, as thunder crackled around the sky and rain beat down on the noisy, flat roof above us.  

In 24 hours' time I will be in Southampton.  This past week has been far, far too slow...
