In a fit of last-minute coding, I've produced version 0.1 of my automated team-picker for the Premier League's Fantasy Football game.  (If you're intending on playing, you only have 12 hours left to get your team in before the start of the season!)

Its purpose is to analyse player stats, and suggest which players to pick based on points/price ratio and current injury lists.  It's based on my team-picker for the Telegraph's fantasy football game, and uses exactly the same algorithm.  It's also run online automatically every day, so you can visit one page to get the latest results.

You can find it here:
