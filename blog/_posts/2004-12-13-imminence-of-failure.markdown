Woke up around midday today, and spent most of the time between then and 11pm feeling tired and as if I was about to collapse.  Result - I got no work done.  7 problem sheets remain, to be done within 36 hours.  Right now, of course, when I really need to get some sleep before my 8am start tomorrow, I feel wide awake.  Staying awake throughout the night is tempting, but I know it's a stupid idea.  

In slightly better news, we might be getting a new housemate sometime soon.  Unfortunately she's coming round to see the house sometime this week, which means at least two hours' worth of tidying.  Worst timing evar.
