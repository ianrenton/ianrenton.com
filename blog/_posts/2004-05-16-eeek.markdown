Four hours later than planned, I'm finally going to bed.  What's been keeping me up for so long, though, is Richard telling me about the story he's writing... which, from the sounds of it, its going to be absolutely awesome...  It's all planned out really well - shame Dreaming Awake isn't like that ^_^;
