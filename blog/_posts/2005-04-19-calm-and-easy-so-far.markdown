Well, looks like I'm slowly getting over the 'flu thing...  I haven't got my appetite back yet though.  If my stomach's reading this, get back to your normal cake-devouring ability quickly, plzkthx.  

Anyways, this morning I managed to get my essay in on time, which was good at least.  Scarily, though, it turns out that we're expected to choose our final year projects... tomorrow.  Argh!  I have no idea...  There's a list of one's that are available that's going 'round, but even then I can't decide - there's a few that look really interesting but pretty hard, while there's ones that really just need a bit of theory and a bit of MATLAB so are easily possible, but might be boring...  Bleh, I dunno.  

Also, I have to get my hair cut ;;_;;  Apparently I'm not allowed to turn up at the funeral with untidy hair.  Go my parents, they don't suck at all.
