*Overcast day<br/>
Evening light fading away<br/>  
Twilight*  

Not sure why, I just felt like doing a fake-Haiku really.  I might do one for each entry... or... well, I dunno.  Anyway... today's been another day of nothingness.  Woke up, used the internet, showeverd and had lunch, used the internet, am about to go and have dinner.  Afterwards, I shall probably use the internet, and go to bed.  It seems like there's nothing else to do, and perhaps there isn't.  It's... lonely.  People go on- and off-line all the time, going about their lives... but I'm always here.  Watching people come and go... forever...  

Is that all there is...?  Sitting here, watching the light fade away...?
