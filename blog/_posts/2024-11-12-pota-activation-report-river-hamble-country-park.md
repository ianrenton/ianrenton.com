My work off-site finished at lunchtime, leaving me with little to do besides drive most of the M27 and sit around at home. A better idea: do some radio nerd stuff in a field instead.

[GB-2465, River Hamble Country Park](https://pota.app/#/park/GB-2465) is sited on the River Hamble as you might expect, between Southampton and Fareham. The park's history dates back to World War II, when it was the site of [HMS Cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Cricket_(shore_establishment)), a training base for Royal Marines that helped prepare for the D-Day invasion. It's a sure sign I've worked with the Navy for too long when I don't even flinch at referring to a shore establishment as "His Majesty's *Ship*", and "stone frigate" has become a perfectly normal concept to entertain in my head.

These days, it's a nice country park with open fields, woodland, a café and various activity centres for Scouts and the like.

After a quick wander around the place, I settled on the large open field to the north of the visitor's centre. There I came across the greatest luxury a POTA activator could ask for: *picnic tables*. Signs warned that they were only for groups that had pre-booked them for barbecues, but as the place was deserted on a chilly November afternoon, I didn't think they would my presence too much.

As usual I started on the 20m band, netting myself 37 contacts around Europe and a couple to North America inside 30 minutes, a few of them park-to-parks. Not bad for a weekday afternoon, I thought.

After that I switched to 10m, which started slow but eventually picked up a bit. 13 more contacts in 20 minutes rounded out the activation, including three transatlantic park-to-parks.

By that time the wind was picking up and I was starting to feel the chill, so I packed down and headed back to the café.

Many thanks to all my contacts this afternoon. See you on the air next time!
