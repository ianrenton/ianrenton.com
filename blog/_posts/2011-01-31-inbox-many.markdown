There's been a recent increase in productivity-related posts on [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/), so inspired by that I thought I'd share how I "get things done", and hopefully swap tips with others!

My approach is simple: I attempt ["Inbox Zero"](http://inboxzero.com/inboxzero/).  And deliberately fail.

After several years of attempting to keep a clean inbox, having any messages at all sitting there really annoys me.  I use that to my advantage and end up doing the polar opposite of "Inbox Zero" -- that is, I use my inbox as my to-do list.  Whenever I think of something I need to do, I write a short e-mail, usually just a subject line, and send it to whatever inbox is appropriate for the task (work or home).

It has the advantage of simplicity -- while corporate firewalls could prevent me from using a `todo.txt` and a filofax could be left at home, there's virtually no situation when I'm more than a few feet from a device that can do e-mail.

And the worry that "Inbox Zero" was designed to address -- huge inboxes that get piled up with junk that never gets acted on -- is avoided because having those e-mails in my inbox, _even though I put them there_, is annoying enough that I clear them as soon as possible.

I've taken to calling the technique "Inbox Many".

So, great untamed hordes of the internet -- I'm intrigued. How do you lot get things done?
