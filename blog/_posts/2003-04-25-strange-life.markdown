Why is it, that I seem to be living my life uncaring, as if small things are unimportant? Things like tidying and cooking don't seem to matter any more, as if a change will come soon that will make them worthless?  

What's happening...?  

Am I changing? Is the world changing?  

...9 days, 15 hours, 55 minutes until Dragon's Claw finale (noon, May 5th, 2003)...  

...am I living a story? Or is that story just what we call "life"?  

...life is a dream...  

...but it's a good dream.
