...until MINAMICON!!  This weekend might possibly be one of the most awesome weekends of my life...  

I've just finished that essay on damped oscillations... and it's nowhere near the 1500-word suggestion.  If, as they say, the one picture in the report really *is* worth a thousand words, then I make it... but only just.  I really can't think of anything else to talk about...  Anyway, I'm happy to have gotten it out of the way to an extent where I might at least get some marks for it...  now I can concentrate on having some fun instead!
