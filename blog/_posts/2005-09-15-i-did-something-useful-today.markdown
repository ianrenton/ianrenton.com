title: I Did Something Useful Today
---

I did something useful today.  Not work, you realise, because there's precious little of that to do.  Instead, in readiness for the Dreaming Awake game this year, I present: Part One of the rules!  

Today: Character Creation.  Tomorrow: Playing the Game!  

For players who haven't read it already: <a href="/rpgs/dreaming-awake-tabletop-intro-paragraph/">Dreaming Awake Tabletop Intro Paragraph</a>  

Today's output, for players and anyone else who wants to pick holes in it: <a href="/rpgs/dreaming-awake-tabletop-character-creation/">Dreaming Awake Tabletop Character Creation</a>
