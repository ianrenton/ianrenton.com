title: When Someone Else's Sofa Starts to Feel like Home
---

...Well, not quite.  It still feels like I'm imposing, sleeping on their sofa, but at least it's Southampton - that's a start.  

Even though not a lot happened this weekend, it was really fun!  I'm not sure quite what kind of cheese the Fantastic Four movie is, but it feels...  Swiss.  Still, at least I was expecting it.  Not having read the comics, though, I feel I shoudl probably keep my comments to myself.  

We went shopping on Saturday, which reminded me of the lesson I learned a few months back.  When I was growing up, I always used to think I hated shopping.  I learnt that what I actually hated was shopping <i>with my mum</i>.  Now that has been recognised and understood, I actually quite like shopping ^_^
