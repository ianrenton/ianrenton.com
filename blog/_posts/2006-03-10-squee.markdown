Well, here goes...  For the second couple in a week:  

Congratulations to Racheet and Chimaera!  

Heheh, it's Spring.  I guess it's the time of year for it...  

Also, Squee the second: Memoirs of a Geisha is fantastic.  Thoroughly reccommended to everyone, except perhaps fans of Azumanga Daioh.  Every time anyone said "Chiyo-chan" I had odd thoughts in my head... ^_^;  

And finally, Doomful Drama the Three hundred and ninety seventh.  Dear gods, it never stops, does it?  If I can at all help it I am not going to choose between one friend and another.  Did it before, broke my heart, not doing it ever again if I have even the slightest chance of avoiding it.  

Oh, also Doomful Drama the Three hundred and ninety eighth.  I have little to say on this one, I don't know either of the two people involved well enough to voice an opinion.
