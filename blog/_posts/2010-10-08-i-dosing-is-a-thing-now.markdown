So, not only does October's edition of [Wired UK](http://www.wired.co.uk/) suggest [4chan](http://www.4chan.org) in its list of unusual places to make friends online -- yup, that would indeed be an unusual place to look -- but it seems to have decided to enlighten its readers on the wonders of i-Dosing too.

Wait, what?  i-Dosing is an actual thing now?

For anyone unaware, "i-Dosing" is purportedly a technique whereby teenagers listen to music that emulates the effects of taking drugs.  There are a number of websites that claim to offer such music, and I suppose it's possible that they actually existed as some kind of weird internet non-entity _before_ the Daily Mail [went fucking crazy](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1296282/I-dosing-How-teenagers-getting-digitally-high-music-download-internet.html) (more so than usual) in July of this year.  I wouldn't, however, be surprised if the _Mail_ article was a ludicrous prank on the reactionary truth-averse newspaper, and the websites sprung up in the aftermath.

(Somebody linked me to a couple of "i-Dosing" tracks back then. The first was a pretty minimalist early-Industrial kind of track, listenable but hardly trippy.  The second was a poor mashup of early-2000s dance hits, which I turned off just for its abysmal production values.)

So congratulations to whoever gave the story to the _Mail_, it's pretty hilarious in an "oh god the media sucks" kind of way.

To the i-Dosing kiddies, curse this new-fangled technology, grumble / pipe / slippers.  What's wrong with the good old two litres of Coke, some high-volume Prodigy and playing WipeOut 64 until it hurts to look _away_ from the screen?  (Or until your mum called you down for lunch, of course.)

And Wired, seriously, i-Dosing is _not a thing_.  At least your sidebar item wasn't a _Mail_-esque "OH GOD YOUR KIDS ARE ON DRUGS" piece, but please, can we all let this story die now?
