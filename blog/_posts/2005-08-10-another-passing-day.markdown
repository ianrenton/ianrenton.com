I guess I was kind of caught off guard by the amount of sympathy I've recieved since that last post ^_^;  I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say that it helped a bit, so thank you everyone!  

It turns out that I couldn't get a doctor's appointment for today, so I'm going tomorrow morning instead.  Today I've been a bit better - there's periods of a few hours at a time in which I feel pretty much normal, during which I've been mostly talking on the phone, feeling guilty that I feel well but aren't at work, making a map for Dreaming Awake, and using the 'net.  

Success reports from the latter two:

And, with about as many responses on either side of my MSN screen name "Please stop me from spending £56 on costume!"...  I just spent £56 on costume.  Oh well...
