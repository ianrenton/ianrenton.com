Well, about 2 o'clock this afternoon we decided to have a barbecue. About 1 o'clock in the morning, I'm sitting on the stairs in our house, listening to Bob Dylan and swigging Scrumpy straight from the bottle. And I've got to go to work tomorrow morning. Well, this morning really.  

Well, it was the most fun Sunday I've ever had ^_^...
