Against all my expectations, the most popular page on this website (at least, the most visited) turns out to be ["The Great Roast Dinner Timing Chart"](https://ianrenton.github.io/roastdinner/), which was my attempt to help newbies at the revered British art of the Roast Dinner get their timings right. I first posted it over eight years agoâ€”in the intervening time I have cooked a lot of roasts and tweaked my timings a bit, so it was in need of an update. I've also cooked roast dinners to serve at all sorts of different times, with variations on the ingredients, so I thought the old list to cook certain things for a fixed 7pm dishing-up time could use some improvements too.

To that end, I've converted it from a static list to an automatically generated one that users can play with. Visitors to the page can now choose their meat and its weight, the accompaniments and the serving time, and the page will do some JavaScript magic to generate a chart just for them. If you're interested, you can [check out the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/ianrenton/roastdinner/blob/master/roastdinner.html). It's not much and not very complicated, but free for anyone to use and modify.

For anyone who prefers the original non-automated version of the Roast Dinner Timing Chart, or anyone without JavaScript capability, you can still get to [the old version here](/recipes/the-great-roast-dinner-timing-chart-old/).

Hopefully it will help someone on the way to cooking their best roast dinner yet!
