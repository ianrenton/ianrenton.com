title: Under the Sky so Blue
---

Today, even waking up at 8.30 and going to lectures in subjects I don't really like seemed fun.  Walking through the city, dressed in only jeans and a t-shirt, feeling the sun on my face as I looked up at the blue sky, and contemplating the fun that lies ahead of me, today and forever in the future...  Today, happiness painted the sky gold and blue, for the first time since the Autumn.
