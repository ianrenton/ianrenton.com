Thanks for everyone's votes, it turns out that the results are overwhelmingly in favour of my starting writing now, with no votes to the contrary and only one for fish.  

So I'm going for it!  My first, very scary foray into cyberpunk.  

It's background material for Forgotten Children, I suppose, but hopefully it holds together on its own.  

Last week's effort, the prologue, and today's, Chapter 1, are linked below.  It's still work-in-progress, so mostly unedited.  As always, suggestions / criticisms / outright flames welcome.  Even noting spelling mistakes as you go along would be handy, I haven't gotten around to that yet.
