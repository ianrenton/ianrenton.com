Last Saturday was the [Linux User & Developer](http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/) [Raspberry Jam](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-linux-user-raspberry-jam-tickets-10095482861) event at Poole RNLI college. I took the tank, of course, and the child too &mdash; worrying all the while that they'd be the youngest kid there by about ten years, and would get bored within half an hour.

How wrong I was.

We eventually escaped almost an hour after the scheduled end of the event, once all the kids had had their fill of Minecraft and the [Raspberry Tank](http://raspberrytank.ianrenton.com).

Along the way we'd met the awesome people from [PiBorg](http://www.piborg.org/) with their much more impressive RPi tank, along with robot arm-wielding BigTraks and 3D LED matrices. We'd done a show-and-tell session, drunk a lot of coffee, and most importantly been part of a room of 20+ kids all learning to code for the first time using Python and Minecraft.

It was really an amazing thing to see and be part of, and my heartfelt thanks go out to the organisers from Linux User for hosting a fantastic day!

Here's the kids playing with our tank:
