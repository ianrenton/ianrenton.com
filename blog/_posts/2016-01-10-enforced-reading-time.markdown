Whilst faffing around with my blog the other day&mdash;in a regular incidence of "it ain't broke but I'm going to fix it anyway"&mdash;I discovered some old half-written short stories that never made it to the web. ([These](/fiction/unnamed-fairies-datacentre-story/) [two](/fiction/the-lost-sky/), if you're interested.) Scrolling through the list of files that comprise my past attempts at fiction, it was immediately obvious that I'd not written even a scrap of a story since 2013. Worse, it's been four years since I wrote anything complete&mdash;a paltry 342-word story called ["Silence"](/fiction/silence/), which my wife pestered me into writing. The last time I wrote something complete for myself was 2011.

More worrying was the train of thought that followed that&mdash;when was the last time I *read* a work of fiction out of preference over doing anything else? Not a book read in a holiday's abundance of free time, not a bedtime story for my child, but a book read out of pleasure, when I could or should be doing other things? Probably Neal Stephenson's ["REAMDE"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Reamde-Neal-Stephenson/dp/1848874510/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452427243&sr=8-1), also in 2011.

I received two books for Christmas, and I'm slowly making my way through one of them: ["Trigger Warning"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Trigger-Warning-Short-Fictions-Disturbances/dp/1472217721/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452427261&sr=8-1), a collection of Neil Gaiman's short stories. Even though each piece is well written and at most 20 pages long, I'm finding it hard going. Every little thing is a distraction. Someone will talk, there's my concentration gone for another five minutes. Another paragraph, and it'll occur to me that the floor is dirty and I ought to hoover. Another two lines. I'm thirsty. I should make coffee.

Can it be that not only am I out of practice at writing, I'm actually out of practice at *reading* too?

It feels like I'm turning into a modern-day version of the parents of Roald Dahl's *Matilda*; I read recipe books and Facebook shares and gadget blogs and clickbait articles and never once settle down with a real good book. Even now, *Trigger Warning* sits a mere two feet away from me, all is quiet and calm, and here I am ignoring it to tap away at a computer keyboard.

Perhaps the answer is to force myself, to set aside an enforced reading time every day, until I remember how to do it again&mdash;until I remember how to get so stuck into a good story that I stop caring about hoovering the floor or who might be commenting on my Facebook status.

Maybe with enough practice, I might even remember how to write again.
