I'll avoid posting too much here, both because my words probably can't do it justice and because most readers of my blog aren't interested in in-character stuff anyway.  Suffice to say that the last five days have been fantastic.  I guess it may well be the ultimate in geekdom, but still, LARPing was one of the most fun things I've ever done.  I'll most certainly be doing it again!
