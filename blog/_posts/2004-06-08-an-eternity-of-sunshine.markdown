Despite the fact I've done virtually nothing today except burn anime onto CD, the awesomeness of today's weather just makes me feel great!  I hope it lasts...  

*"From burning sky, there is white and burning sun.  <br/>
The horizon reflects, waveringly in my eyes  <br/>
The blowing sand, is filling up the sky and  <br/>
a ripple spreads, far away just like the sea..."  *<br/>
 ~ EIKO - Suna no Shiro
