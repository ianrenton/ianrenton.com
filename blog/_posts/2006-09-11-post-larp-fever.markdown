As always, post-LARP fever is getting to me.  For three days I've dealt with matters of life and death in a place a thousand miles and a world away, and tomorrow...  Tomorrow I have to get up at 6am, go to work and pretend none of it really happened.  

I'm going to be in a very strange mood for a while.  As usual. =S
