The post-LARP crash continues this morning, and as usual after the contents of my weekend real life seems meaningless and uninteresting by comparison.  Still, I guess I have to concentrate on real-life things for a while.  I'm hungry and have no food, and I have tons of work to do in the next few weeks, and Eric is apparently arriving tomorrow.
