title: Wandering in Beauty
---

Today, I'm on an adventure.  Walking aimlessly between the sunny sky and the verdant land, marvelling at the beauty of the world...  Truly, there's no better feeling than this...  Although I'm alone, I'm still happy and peaceful...  This is the kind of place I always long to be, the kind of emotion I always yearn to feel.  

Oddly, this feels almost like home - but whichever material location I choose to call my home these days is devoid of places and feelings like these.  No, the home this reminds me of is the home of a person I'm not, who lives in a place I can never go and has a past I could never have had.  

But when I come to places like these, I can start to believe that my dreams and my reality aren't so different after all...
