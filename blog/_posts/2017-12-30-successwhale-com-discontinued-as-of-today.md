As far as I know, SuccessWhale is not being actively used by anyone any more, so I have chosen not to renew the domain name `successwhale.com` when it expires today. Like most of my past web-based projects, it will continue to live on at an `onlydreaming.net` subdomain, in this case [sw.onlydreaming.net](http://sw.onlydreaming.net), but will not be actively maintained there.  As well as its graphical web interface, SuccessWhale also has a back-end API that used to run on a SuccessWhale subdomain. This has now moved to [https://successwhale-api.herokuapp.com/](https://successwhale-api.herokuapp.com/). The [OnoSendai](http://www.onosendai.mobi/) Android client already uses this address for the API as of update 479, so you may need to update. Thank you to all the SuccessWhale users over the years!
