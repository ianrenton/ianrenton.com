Argh... I want to do *something*.. something creative.  But there's really not a lot to do...  I'd like to design some graphics in Photshop, but I know I'm not good enough to achieve a good effect...  I'd like to do some stuff for my websites, but I'm really not sure if there's anything I can do.  There's just... nothing useful I can do, at all...
