It seems kinda' odd being back here again, but then... we were only away for three weeks...  Bournemouth, I've decided (with all my friends and family there) is better than Southampton.  But living here is great too!  We celebrated our first evening back as Flat 4 by... drinking and ordering a takeaway pizza!  Nothing ever changes, does it? ^_^
