Whoa, now *that* feels good.  Finally, it's the weekend, I can sleep, and have fun, and go to LAC on Sunday, and do some stuff for the <a href="/fiction/dreaming-awake/">Dreaming Awake website</a> and all sorts of stuff... and I don't have to worry about work for another few days!  

And then, only one more week until the Christmas holidays...!
