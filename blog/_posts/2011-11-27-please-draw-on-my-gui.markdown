For my current project, my mock-ups have now progressed to the PowerPoint stage, which sits between whiteboard drawings and actual code, and thus lets me briefly pretend to be a real user experience person.  Rather than consigning it to my hard drive for all eternity, I figured I'd get some input on it from the rest of my team -- and, in for a penny and so on, everyone else who sets foot in the office.

They're pinned up on the wall, alongside the following:

So far, it appears to be working.  And astoundingly, no dicks yet either.  It can only be a matter of time.
