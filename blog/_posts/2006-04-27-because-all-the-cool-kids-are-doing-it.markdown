(10 of the top 12 posts on my friends page now mention the Wii)

<b>What could have been:</b>  

Introducing... WRYYYYYYYYYY!  

As in, "we."  

While the code-name "Revolution" expressed our direction, WRYYYYYYYYYYY represents the answer.  

WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYY will break down the wall that separates video game players from everybody else.  

WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYY will put people more in touch with their games... and each other.  But you're probably asking: What does the name mean?  

WRYYYYYYYYYYYY sounds like "we," which emphasises this console is for everyone.  

WRYYYYYYYYYYY can easily be remembered by people around the world, no matter what language they speak.  No confusion.  No need to abbreviate.  Just WRYYYYYYYYYY!  

WRYYYYYYYYYYYY has a distinctive "YYYYYYYYYYY" spelling that symbolises both the unique controllers and the image of people gathering to play.  

And WRYYYYYYYYYYY, as a name and a console, brings something revolutionary to the world of video games that sets it apart from the crowd.  

So that's WRYYYYYYYYYYY.  But now Nintendo needs you.  

Because, it's not really about you or me.  

It's about WRYYYYYYYYYYYY.  

And together, WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYY will change everything.
