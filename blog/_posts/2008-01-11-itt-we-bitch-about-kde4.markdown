title: ITT we bitch about KDE4

So, KDE4 eh?  No offence to the programmers, they've certainly achieved something beyond my capabilities, but...  So many irritations =S  

<ul><li>Despite a more streamlined codebase and less memory-hungry Qt4, it still runs slow as a dog on my EeePC.</li>  

<li>That's without any visual effects.  Turning on compositing makes it near unusable.  Oh, and even "fade in menus" (non-composited) displays an ugly mash of pixels before the menu fully renders, a la KDE 3.5.</li>  

<li>Plasma looks very shiny, shame there's only a few widgets with very important things - NetworkManager frontend, volume control - totally missing.</li>  

<li>There aren't icons for half the widgets, and a random selection of other things</li>  

<li>You can't drag widgets onto, or off, the panel.</li>  

<li>The panel has no properties.  You can't move it, or resize it.  My screen height is 480px, and this thing takes up 10% of it!</li>  

<li>Window names in the taskbar line-wrap, which is fine for two lines worth, but when there's a third line it's partly off-screen and looks ugly.</li>  

<li>KickOff irritates the hell out of me for various reasons, I reverted to the standard menu almost immediately.</li>  

<li>Though it gives you the option to apply QT colouring to GTK apps, it just applies colour to the butt-ugly GTK1-esque default</li>  

<li>Firefox crashed hard the first time I ran it</li>  

<li>I can't make Marble get past the "loading Atlas" dialog</li>  

<li>Plasma is damn pretty, but everything else is by default a vast swathe of grey</li>  

<li>Konqueror still doesn't run Gmail, even if you make it pretend to be something else</li> </ul> 

tl,dr: grumble grumble rant.
