title: Falling Apart...
---

From some recent LJ posts (Phi's and Frieza's especially), plus the stuff that's been going on on the DDRFUK forums and IRC channel, I'm kinda' worried...  There seems to be a lot of bad stuff going on that I'm only scraping the surface of.  

I'm not sure which is more selfish, not wanting to burden myself with the knowledge of what's going on, or wanting people to tell me about everything.  But... even though I've only seen most of these people once or twice, or maybe even never, they still feel like friends to me, so... I want to know what's going on...
