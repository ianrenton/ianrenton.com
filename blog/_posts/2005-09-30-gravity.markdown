Already I'm feeling the irresistable pull...  Tomorrow, I'm going home.  I'm going to see friends again, and life will be full again after too many empty nine-'til-fives, Mondays-to-Fridays.  Each IM conversation, each 'phone call, each text message, they all bring me closer.  

In only twelve hours, I'll be up and getting ready to go.  And yet it's still too long.  I'm looking forward to this, I think, more than I've ever looked forward to anything before.
