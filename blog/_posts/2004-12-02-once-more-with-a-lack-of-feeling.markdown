title: Once More with a Lack of Feeling
---

Yet again, another night of 13 hours' sleep.  Yet again, I wake up and gaze out of the window at the sun setting behind the trees.  I guess that, slowly but surely, this much rest must be letting me recover.  At least, I hope so.  If not, I must try to resist my sudden urge to hibernate.  Winter, as always, brings its own new set of wonderful emotions and feelings - and yet, I do long for the sunshine again...
