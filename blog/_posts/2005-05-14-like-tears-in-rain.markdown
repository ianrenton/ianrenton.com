I'm not sure why, but today... as rain drizzles to the ground outside, and the house feels cold and lonely...  I'm feeling angsty again, despite the season.  It's the first time in a long time that everyone else has been busy; except for me, sitting on my own, doing nothing.  I guess I should watch anime or play games or something, but that just feels like escaping...
