All the things I've done up to now... they don't seem to have lasted. The work that I did at school - it started and finished there. And I was just the same as everyone else, and what I did there would never be important.  

But now, the things I'm making might still be around in years, or maybe decades time... And maybe I'll see them then, the things that I did... and maybe I'll remember what I did, and how, and why... I might remember the music I was listening to, the friends I had, the view from my office window...  

Maybe I'll be proud... maybe I won't care. Maybe I won't remember... Maybe my life will have taken me far away from the things I try hard for now, and maybe they'll fade into unimportance too...
