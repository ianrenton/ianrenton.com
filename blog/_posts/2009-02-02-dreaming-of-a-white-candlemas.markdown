Candles burn in the windows of the flat, dividing the warmth of the inside from the darkness and the snow that still coats the ground outside.

Today, after being out of the house an hour, I'd travelled about a hundred yards.  All in all, two and a half hours were spent getting to work, and all the while Twitter regailed me of the tales of those lucky buggers who got to work from home!

Still, having survived the day, I am now full of pig and cider, and busy celebrating a holiday that I'm probably Pagan enough to celebrate the alleged pre-Christian roots of.
