Never have I been reminded more than I was today that fairies come in all shapes and sizes.  Specifically, those responsible for the tangling of string, rope and miscellaneous cords whilst no-one is looking.  

Many months ago, we unwound a cable from its drum and laid it out along a concreted area.  This is a cable of no half measures - four hundred metres in length and nearly two inches thick, military spec, designed to last for decades at the bottom of the sea.  The whole drum of it weighs about as much as a small car.  

Since it was laid out, barely a human hand has touched it.  It's survived gales and rain without moving an inch.  

When we came to move it today?  

Tangled.  It took three of us nearly an hour to sort it out.  

Somewhere out there, there's a bunch of <i>really strong</i> cable-tangling fairies.
