So, the other day I cheated at a videogame for what is probably the first time in years.  Not for unfair advantage over other players, but merely because it was one of those [games with no end](/blog/on-game-design-time-to-quit), and before consigning it to the dustbin of history, I wanted to see what the best weapons were like.

It was a pretty simple hack -- an in-game replacement of the contents of a certain memory address, the same thing I had no shame whatsoever in applying via a [Game Genie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Genie) nearly two decades ago.  And, just as hoped, I eked out a few more hours of fun from the game with my new-found power to lay waste to civilisation.

The best weapons in this game can only be purchased with the game's "premium" currency, which I simply awarded myself 9999 of with barely a second thought.  But in this world of in-app purchases and micropayments, the company who makes the game want me to have paid for that amount of in-game cash.  Out of interest, I calculated how much money I would have paid to acquire it through legitimate channels.

£840.

Now, although there's no way I've obtained £840 worth of value from my cheating, it raises an odd ethical dilemma that's relatively new to gaming.  Have I just cheated to gain myself another couple of hours' enjoyment?  Or have I just cheated someone out of the better part of a thousand pounds?

I'd be happy to pay a reasonable amount -- £10, say -- for the amount of enjoyment I've had from the game.  But the ["freemium"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium) business model of many modern, social games makes that surprisingly difficult.  Instead, I must get 99% of my fun for free, then pay extortionate amounts of real money for the last 1%.  But, having cheated, I have no option at all to pay what I think is fair apart from simply buying my £10 worth of the game's currency, even though it would barely register against the huge value I have unfairly awarded myself.
