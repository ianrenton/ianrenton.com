As a twenty-six-year-old software engineer -- I shan't use the word "programmer", for obvious reasons -- who's only ever really had one job, I probably ought to refrain from posting an opinion on this post:

[Don't Call Yourself a Programmer](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer)

But I will anyway.  It's true, every single word of it.  I'm lucky enough to be in that 10% of jobs that isn't producing "line of business" software, but that percentage doesn't seem far off the mark.  And all the rest applies -- in my industry perhaps more than most, the points about networking and about managers hiring people they know ring true.

It's a long read, but if you're in the software industry or at University aiming for a job in software, do yourself a favour and read it.  It's well-written and probably the most concentrated page of good advice you will read this year.
