There needs to be a Pirates of the Carribean musical, and I need to star in it.  Although, if it actually happens I'd appreciate a microphone.  

Still, that dream was awesome.  

Now it feels like my ears are full of cotton wool and my left knee doesn't work very well.  I blame the heavy metal skipping.
