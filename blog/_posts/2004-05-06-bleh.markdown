Okay, so I stayed up until about 4am last night.  The evening was really fun, but the next few days won't be...  I have a *lot* of work to do by Friday, and my flatmates are also expecting me to go out tonight to celebrate my birthday.  On top of that, I had about 4 hours' sleep last night, and I'll be having about the same tomorrow night.  I have a headache, I don't feel great, I'm insanely tired, I can't work very well (great fun for the test I've got coming up in an hour's time) and I haven't eaten a proper cooked meal since Monday.
