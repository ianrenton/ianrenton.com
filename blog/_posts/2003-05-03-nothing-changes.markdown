*The Moment of Truth has Begun.*

*"It's just another day,<br/>
and in an ordinary way,<br/>
nothing changes."*<br/>
&mdash; Celtus, "Changes"

Springtime, midday sun, and a train journey wrapped in thought. Wherever we go, however much time passes for us, we'll always be here, we'll always go to the same places, do the same things, love and hate, laugh and cry, in the same ways... Forever and ever, echoing on always through time, long past the time when we leave this world for another... The grassy fields, the quiet waters, the beautiful golden sunlight... forever and ever, this life and this love will never cease. Dancing for eternity, spinning the story of the world...
