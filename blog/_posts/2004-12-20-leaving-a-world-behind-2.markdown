So ended another term.  It felt like an awful lot happened in these past few months, and when I think about it the time was full of memories being made.  Happy ones and sad ones too, but in a way the emotion doesn't matter.  It's memories that make these days everlasting - the best days of our lives.  

Let's all make more memories together next term!  Merry Christmas everybody!
