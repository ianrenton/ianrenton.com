The problem with Roleplaying is, life as Tsuki is more fun...  

I seem to fit well into playing as Tsuki in our Exalted game, even though the way I seem to be playing is quite unlike me... or is it? The more I think about it, the things I do in life seem to split into Ian-like things and Tsuki-like things... I'm a programmer, but I can skill manage to walk into closed doors... People think I'm reliable, but I still avoid serious things...  

But most of all, I keep on dreaming, the most important thing we have in common...
