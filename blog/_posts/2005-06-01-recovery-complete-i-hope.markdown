Well, it looks like I'm back to being my normal Ian/Tsuki thingy again.  That's a good thing, I guess, although it does seem to mean I get hungry more and do less housework.  Ah well.  Maybe, just hopefully, I'll now be able to revise for my exam in 36 hours' time.  I'm confident, though, it's a ridiculously easy subject.  Only problem is, there's an essay question on which we don't get a choice of subject.  I'm not looking forward to the exam, I bet the essay will be on lasers, or aberrations, the two subjects I don't really know all that well...
