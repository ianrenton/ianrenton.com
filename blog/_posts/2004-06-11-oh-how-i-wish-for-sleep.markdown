title: Oh, How I Wish for Sleep
---

So, I went to bed about 1.30am - not unusual.  Unfortunately I forgot to set an away message on MSN, so at 2.30am I get worken up by Ike's incessant spam.  After that, I manage to get to sleep until 5.30am, whereupon people start talking in the corridor outside my room, and the door do Jo's room starts slamming once every minute or so.  

That's still continuing, albeit less frequently now.  But now it's light outside, and the chances of me being able to get any sleep at all from now on are zero.  So I guess today is official caffeine day for me!
