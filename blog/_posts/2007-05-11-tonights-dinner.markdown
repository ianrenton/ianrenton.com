Tonight's dinner:  

Pan-fried venison with a port wine and mushroom sauce, new potatoes, breaded garlic mushrooms and peas.  

Venisonsquee!  

However, being as it was farmed rather than wild, the meat was a bit 'meh', rather than the gamier taste of wild venison.  What worries me is that, from this sentence, I appear to have become a venison connoisseur.  I'm sure 22-year-old almost-students aren't supposed to do that... =S
