title: Almost a new Story Arc
---

I think I can finally see things becoming better...  Minami's coming up, I might have found a place to live in Southampton, the Dreaming Awake roleplay system's finally coming together, and... I just kinda' feel that I'm on top of things.  On the other hand, Dom still isn't happy, which kinda' puts a downer on things, but I'm sure the new arc will deserve to start soon...  A change from the current, depressing, one will be good.  Current favourite title for the next one is "Sun Dancer" saga.
