At long last... I have a LiveJournal thing!  Apologies if it gets taken up with pointless musings or pseudo-poetry... I'll try my best to do something useful though.  

Not forgetting, thanks to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=sasahara">Sasahara</a> of <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/anime_england/">Anime-England</a> for the code!
