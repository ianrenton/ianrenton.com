A job for bored lazywebbers:

What with Saudi Arabia recently having declared software piracy to be a criminal offence punished by imprisonment, there are certain kinds of DS cartridges that I would be unwilling to take into the country!  I will however be taking my DS, my 2nd gen iPod Touch, and my HTC Magic (running Android).

Are there any games for those platforms that offer a shedload of play time per Â£ -- ideally RPGs, strategy games, or the combination thereof?

I have already played to death: TWEWY, Fire Emblem, Advance Wars and Heroes of Mana on the DS, Plants vs Zombies and Angry Birds on the iTouch, and every damn tower defence game on Android.

And no, I still don't have enough spare cash to buy a PSP!

All suggestions appreciated! :D

tl;dr: Internet, please recommend time-sink games.
