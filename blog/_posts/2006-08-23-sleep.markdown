I really need to stop falling asleep on trains.  Today I was woken up by the 'doors closing' beeps at the station I needed to get off at.  

It's surprising how quickly one can get out of one's seat, halfway down a carriage and out the door when one needs to.  Unusually for me, I even managed to remember my umbrella, and thus not make it two losses within a week!  (Go me.)
