Headache OF THE YEAR desu~.  

Woke up at 6am after 3 hours' sleep with a headache so bad I could barely think and feeling sick.  I had no painkillers at all, so I lay around in bed waiting for either Mark to get up or for the pharmacist to open.  When eventually I did manage to get to sleep again, I had some very strange dreams indeed...  

Now dosed up on paracetamol thanks to Mark.  Should've been heading into town three hours ago for shopping and all-you-can-eat Chinese with Mark, Andy and Rhiannon.  Have failed to do so.  

I hate headaches.
