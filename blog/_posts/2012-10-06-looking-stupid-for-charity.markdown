It's nearly November again, and that means two things.  Firstly, my glum acceptance for the tenth year in a row that I cannot [write a novel](http://www.nanowrimo.org) given a whole lifetime to do it in, let alone a single month.  It also means I have the wonderful opportunity to look silly for charity.  (More silly than normal, anyway.)  Yes indeed, I have been coerced into growing a ridiculous moustache for the duration of November, in order to raise money for the charities Prostate Cancer UK and the Institute of Cancer Research.  Yep, it's ['Mo'vember](http://uk.movember.com/?home).

I will be starting clean-shaven on November 1st, and keeping my moustache intact until the 30th, whereupon I will probably take a photo for posterity before shaving it off and feeling the most relieved I have ever felt. But until then? Let the horror commence.
