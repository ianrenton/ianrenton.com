title: And So the Exodus Begins
---

It's beginning to happen already - the first of us, that group of who've been together for three years now, has already left university for the final time.  Over the next two weeks, the rest of us will follow.  No more shall we call this city our home.  

There's a whole wide world out there waiting for us, but it waits for us separately.  

It's times like this, for me, that I can almost feel the hope that burns within us fading.  But it won't fade, not at all.  Because no matter how far apart we all become, we've shared so many things that have bound us together.  Our common experiences will keep us as one, forever and ever.  

And when I think of the future that way, it's not so scary any more.
