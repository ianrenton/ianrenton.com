I thought it would feel very odd to be back in Southampton again, but now that I'm here it's not so odd after all.  Going to the pub with my flatmates, coming back home and being on IRC... it all comes back so easily ^_^  

Unfortunately, I did practically no work over Easter, so the work that needs to be in for this week is going to be painful... also, I have a lot less money than I wish I had...
