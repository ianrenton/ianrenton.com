First up: Shiny things!  I now have an extremely shiny new naginata.  I'm really happy! ^_^  I wish the weather would be good enough for me to take it outside, though...  

Next up: Hallowe'en.  Ten days away now, and as usual I'm doing nothing and although I'd almost like to dress up for it, I don't think I will.  (I don't think I'd really look good as any kind of Hallowe'en spirit.)  

This reminds me of two things - first of all, dressing up.  I'm still torn two ways over my cosplay for Minamicon, and I've not even thought about making either costume.  Secondly, it reminds me that we have 10 days to find a new housemate.  If we end up with someone we don't know, it's going to feel quite weird...  

Tomorrow things:  I have a 9am lecture on Classical Mechanics, in which we'll be taught how to calculate the curl of a vector field.  Hi, we were taught this last year!  It's not good to be skipping lectures this early I know, but I really don't see the point in turning up.  

In the evening, we kick off Zane's World of Darkness game, bringing to number of RPGs I'm involved with this year to four.  This might conceivably break my brain by the end of it.  That also means I have four characters' worth of angsty back-story to write soon.  A scary prospect...  

And sometime in the near future we've got to get our landlord to sort out the fact that you can surf on our kitchen floor, we've got to provide the letting agents with an inventory for the place and our council tax exemption stuff that we don't even get for another two weeks, and deal with the ever-looming prospect of convincing TV licence inspectors that we don't watch our TV.  

Somewhere in the middle of this, I'm attempting to remain sane.  I am finding flavoured toffees and Galaxy Angel OSTs very useful in achieving this end.
