Today, I stepped completely inside an illusory mind.  But yet, it's not so entirely illusory.  When I think about it, there was one event in my life that set in motion a change that made me who I am today, emotionally speaking.  Without that one event, I would be a person like Malachai.  I'm not sure if it should worry me or not that I can step so completely inside his mind at will.  

*"The mind is all that is real!  All that makes us human!  It's meaningless to try and supress your own desires!"*  

Either way, it certainly made for an interesting roleplaying session (and here I should apologise to Adam, and most of the people I know online, blogging entirely about a roleplaying game).  It seems that, even though I no longer get angry with anything, I can slip into being someone who does with remarkable ease.  And pretty much all the things I said (at high volume, for at least five minutes, shouting at at least two voices in my head) are things that I verge on believing myself.  

*"You're all just figments of my imagination!  I am the fundamental thing!  There is no reason for me to obey your desires over my own!"*  

In a way I'm thankful that I'm not Malachai, although I've begun to fear that should I ever "snap", I might become the way he did today.  Hopefully I will never find out if it's possible for me to snap.  

*"Your eyes lie to you, your taste buds and your ears lie to you!  Humans don't have or need a body, the mind is all that matters!"*  

If I consider the self I call "Ian" to be a reference point, I think that Malachai may be some sort of counterpart to Tsuki.  At first, I think of Malachai and Tsuki as two extremes, but when I consider it more deeply there's a number of ways in which those two are alike while Ian is not.  In fact, when I bring various RP characters into the complex interreaction inside my mind, the structure that I envisioned when Ian and Tsuki were the only two personality layers falls apart.  This may be a good or a bad thing - either way, I think I need to reconsider my Mental Structure essay before I commit it to paper (and the internet).  

*"I don't need to listen to voices in my head that aren't mine!  I am all that is, and all I ever need!"*  

In the end, at least, one thing is reassuring.  Just as other characters in the game managed to talk and reason Malachai out of his rage eventually, I am sure that my friends will always be able to help me should I end up in a bad emotional state in real life too.  

*"In the end, you were right.  Who is inside whomever's head makes no difference - there is a right way and a wrong way to treat others, whatever your belief or definition of reality.  I believe in myself, and I believe in you.  I trust you, and I have faith in you, my friends..."  

 ~ Thoughts of Malachai Black, a created character and an aspect of myself.
