I just had a fantastic dream...  I can't really remember what the story was now, but it seemed to involve an awful lot of things that were on my mind, combining them into what must have been an hour-long story that ended with me feeling an almost perfect sense of peace and completion...  Then I woke up, somehow refreshed despite only six hours' sleep, with sunlight streaming in through the curtains...Just for a moment, I think, all is right with the world.
