I guess it's funny who you do and who you don't stay in touch with.  After all this time I'm still partying with people whose time at Uni didn't even intersect with mine, but yet I see my best friends maybe once a year at most. And of the three people I spent my time at Uni developing crushes on? I haven't spoken to two of them since 2006.
