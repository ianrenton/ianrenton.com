Well, as yesterdays are wont to do, yesterday finished.  I think today is a little cloudier, and a little lonlier, than yesterday was.  Still, it's to be expected.  If every day was like yesterday, it wouldn't have been special.  So, it's time to go on with life after a day-long break.  

I'm thinking, though...  When I said being 20 didn't feel like being 19...  Maybe I lied a little.  Two decades feels somehow important, now that I think about it.  Maybe something is changing.
