Rant time I'm afraid.  

So, I found a flat.  A really nice one - pretty big rooms, balcony, nice views, really close to the town centre, and within budget.  Eric liked the sound of it too, so I called the agents to pick a time to sign contracts.  

Then, I find that if a tenant hasn't worked for the last 6 months (that's me, since I graduated in July) they need a guarantor.  No problem, I say, I'll ask my parents.  They know that I can afford the place, my mum even saw the sums for herself, so all it'd be is a signature on a piece of paper and they'd never have to worry about it.  

They flat-out refused me.  

If everywhere requires 6 months of previous employment, I'm pretty much stuffed until mid-January.  Eric's job in Bournemouth starts in a few weeks, so she'd have to move here anyway.  I mentioned to my parents that if we didn't get a flat before then, she'd have to stay at their house with me until we did.  

Then, I find out that their offer that Eric could live here whilst we look for a flat was "only temporary".  What the hell do they expect  

us to do, live in a cardboard box for two months?  

Now I have the twin joys of breaking the news to Eric that we might not be able to get a flat anytime soon after all, and trying to somehow convince the letting agent that we can be trusted enough to allow us to rent (even despite the massive deposit + agents' fee).  

What gets me most about it all is that the agency's need for a guarantor is obvious - they don't know me, they have no reason to trust me that I'll actually pay.  My parents' refusal to be guarantor kind of implies they have just as little trust.  

I should have guessed, really =S  

<i>EDIT: Hopefully, Eric's parents will be guarantors for me.  Crisis hopefully averted, but there are some problems even with that.  Thanks for everyone's advice and sympathy!</I>
