Last night was... a little weird.  I had a dream - a very long and, I think, important one.  Then I *dreamed* that I woke up, wrote it all down, and went back to bed.  There was another dream after that; which was about Lime, Elise, Stel and I in a Spanish seaside bar buying drinks with 5p coins.  

Weird, yes.  But I'm annoyed that I didn't actually wake up to take notes on the first one...
