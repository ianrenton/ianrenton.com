Eeek... too little time to do anything, because I spend too much of it sleeping or just doing nothing...  And too little money, although I continue to spend it anyway...  

Well, tomorrow I should be meeting up with Adam in town, going shopping and having some BemaniFun, Saturday's the DDRUK meet, Sunday apparently I'm being dragged off to church in the morning (I know not why...) and then going to see a band playing in a pub somewhere in the evening, with Elise and Adam and hopefully Ant too.  Ehh, there's so much stuff... ^_^;
