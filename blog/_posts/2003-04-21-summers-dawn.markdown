I think I've found the good thing about living in Weymouth... I woke up and went to work this morning, it was a bit cloudy, and I hardly saw anyone. When I went home at 3:30, the sun was out, and the road I live on (which happens to be the quayside) had sprouted about a hundred people and a street cafe.  

It looks like summer's finally here....... Heheh! I can't wait!
