Woohaha, I've finished my exams!  Today's Forces and Fields exam didn't go so bad... I guess it was a pretty good idea to do that practice paper at the weekend...  It caused a bit of trouble, but I finished well before time.  And the Electronics exam yesterday, I pwned! =p  I'm seriously hoping for 100% for the exam there.  

Well, I'm off out in a minute to celebrate! ^_^  My flatmates are dragging me out to Academy tonight.  

In other news, MMWP 9thStyle went live yesterday, so I'm doing a lot of work trying to sort stuff out there...  I'm gonna bake a cake tomorrow, a kinda' lemon-flavoured sponge cake I think.  Also, I'll be doing a stepfile for Rinbu Revolution, the opening to Utena, when I have time - now that I've finished <a href="http://www.bemanistyle.com/sims/?id=4587">We Will Always Be</a>!  

I'm glad Dom seems to be okay today... yesterday was kinda scary...  O_;;
