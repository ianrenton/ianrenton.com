That... was awesome.  My birthday parties just keep on getting shinier and shinier!  Thank you to everyone who turned up, especially those of you who came in costume.  Sooo happy! *bounces*  

It's good to be home afterwards though, too.  Every part of my body aches, and it's really good to be home and warm again.  I may need to sleep for some time...  

Thank you, everyone...
