Tonight, Eric and I were going to go to the cinema, then to the pub.  She decided she wasn't keen after all, so...  

On cinema tickets, I saved £15.  

On cinema food, I saved £10.  

On drinks, I saved £10.  

On dinner, I saved £20.  

So, in total, I had £55 for to do something sensible, like pay off credit card bills.  

Yeah, er, that didn't happen.  Instead, I spent said money on some faggoty guitar game =S  

Well, I guess I need something to do while 4chan is down.
