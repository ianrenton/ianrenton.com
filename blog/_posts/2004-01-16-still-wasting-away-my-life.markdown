title: Still wasting away my life...
---

...not working as hard as I should, being distracted, doing nothing...  I... don't know why this is what my life is becoming...  Or whether it's a good or a bad thing...  It's almost like being outside of time, watching the hours flow past like lucid memories, my mind forgetting their passing as soon as they have gone...  

So, I'm steadily failing to do tonight's work, I'm eating chocolate like there's no tomorrow, staring at a computer screen without doing anything useful... and having to be awake again in five an a half hours, yet I don't feel like going to bed...  

It's not dream-tripping, or it doesn't feel like it - I'm not tired enough... And it's not the sense that nothing matters at all, like I sometimes get... it's just... odd...  Oh well, I guess that's another odd thing to add to my list of ways in which I'm really weird! ^_^
