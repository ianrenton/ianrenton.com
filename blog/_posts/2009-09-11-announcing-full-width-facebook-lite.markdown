Do I blog anything these days apart from new software?  Oh well, here goes:

"Full Width Facebook Lite" is possibly the world's shortest Greasemonkey script: it simply removes the right-hand bar in the new [Facebook Lite](http://lite.facebook.com), thus removing the ad and the big white space, allowing the actual content to span the full width.  Useful for people who don't like ads, and people with small displays!

**To reiterate, this is for the new Lite version of Facebook that's currently in beta at [http://lite.facebook.com](http://lite.facebook.com). It has no effect on regular Facebook.**

It requires Firefox with Greasemonkey, and probably works in anything else that supports the same kind of user scripts.

There's no point putting this under the GPL, it's so simple, so it's public domain.  You can grab it using the links below.
