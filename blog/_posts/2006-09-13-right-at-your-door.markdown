To: The director, scriptwriter and associated staff of the recently-released movie "Right at Your Door"  

Should you wish to follow up the no-doubt superbly mediocre reception of your film with another, I highly reccommend the conversion from story to film of some bunch of crap by a talentless hack known as "<a href="/fiction/katrina-s-legacy">Katrina's Legacy</a>".  You will find it very much in genre.  Around four years time should be an appropriately meaningful release date.  I also heartily reccommend giving the author of said story large wodges of cash.  

Also, apart from the first half-hour or so, Right At Your Door is reasonably good.
