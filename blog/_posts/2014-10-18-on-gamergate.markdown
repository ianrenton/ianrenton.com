Dear GamerGate supporters, trolls, flamers and everyone associated:

Here is a pale blue dot.

![](/img/blog/2014/10/PaleBlueDot.jpg){: .center}

Really, it's *the* [pale blue dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot).

To abuse the words of Carl Sagan: That's here. That's home. That's us. That's you, everyone you have ever loved, and everyone you've ever hated. It's every videogame player, creator and journalist. It's Zoe Quinn and everyone she may or may not have slept with. It's Anita Sarkeesian and everyone who's ever sent her death threats. It's all of 4chan and 8chan and Reddit and everyone who's ever posted there.

We are alone in space, the only inhabited planet we know of in a universe unimaginably wide.

We are the pinnacle of four billion years of evolutionary history. There has never been a species as intelligent and as capable of wonder as our own. Maybe there never will be again.

We have more than any previous generation. We have built great modern wonders that have brought us closer together, allowed us to understand each other better than ever before. Languages and cultures are no longer a barrier to us.

We alone have come together as a species, shared our skills and our technologies, and sent our representatives to other worlds.

So *please*, can we stop threatening each other on the internet? It's beneath us, and we should know better.
