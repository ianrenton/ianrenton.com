It's a week of leave from work, I have nothing urgent to do, and so: my second POTA activation in two days!

This one had a very different feel to [Saturday's sunny afternoon activation](/blog/pota-activation-report-hengistbury-head/). The day dawned damp and windy, but at least not actively raining&mdash;sadly, that was to change almost immediately as soon as I got into the car. By the time I reached the cliff tops, it was coming down as a slow steady fall, and the coast was wrapped in low-level cloud.

Not willing to waste my trip (or the extortionate parking), I wandered for a while in search of somewhere I could set up out of the rain. There are a couple of wooden shelters near to Western Road car park, but neither offered a place to site an antenna without it being in other people's way or out of my sight.

Once I got as far as deciding the rain had stopped, and had half an antenna up, before the weather changed its mind and I had to pack down again. Not that I mind the weather too much&mdash;I am British after all, and humans are pretty waterproof. But sadly FT-891s are not, and I wasn't willing to risk the field radio that I spent months agonising over buying.

So I did that one thing I said I never wanted to do: activate a park from my car.

*My operating location. I'm getting out in nature, honest.*

This is a relatively new park, [GB-1728 Poole Bay Cliffs](https://pota.app/#/park/GB-1728), and I would only be the second activator. My activation spot is not *technically* on the protected cliff area, but as that's both off-limits and at severe risk of landslides, I hope the POTA police won't mind me placing my antenna five metres back from the edge. My spot also isn't really that close to UK Bunker [G/B-0232 ROC Post Canford Cliffs](https://bunkerwiki.org/?s=B/G-0232), but is within the 1km radius so I decided to count it. I checked out the actual bunker location for a potential activation spot, but not only is there no structure there, it's also overlooked by about 100 hotel balconies. Anxiety won out, and I found a more secluded place to set up instead.

I started off with a bunch of park-to-park QSOs, thinking I would probably just stick with my 10 for POTA, and not worry about 25 for UKBOTA, since the weather was so bad. But after seven, I was struggling to get through to the other POTA stations, and decided to call CQ.

As usual, the pile-up delivered, and I feel rude for leaving while it's going on. So 40 minutes and 47 QSOs later, I finally had a break from callers, and decided to swap to 10m.

By this time the weather had cleared a bit, although I was still getting drizzled on as I went to reconfigure the antenna.

10 metres, unfortunately, was a total washout. I heard one US station, KK2W, but was unable to get through, and hunting the various US POTA stations on the band was similarly unsuccessful.

After ten minutes of CQ calls, I only had two in the log. One was Adrian, M7EFA who let me know that my pre-recorded CQ message had an odd sound to it over the air, so that's useful knowledge at least&mdash;I will have to re-record that. However, by that point the time was getting near to 1400, and I'd come out without my lunch, so I decided to call it quits for today.

See you on the air next time!
