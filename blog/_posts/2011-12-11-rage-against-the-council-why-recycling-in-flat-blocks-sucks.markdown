A few minutes ago, I attempted the simple task of taking out a bag full of recycling.  Having circumnavigated the car that some thoughless Mazda-driver saw fit to park in front of the area where our recycling bins are kept, I discovered this:

Not only is there no way I could fit my recycling into these bins, but each and every one -- ten in total -- is marked with a "Contaminated" sticker, meaning that the collection people saw something they didn't like in every bin, and refuse to collect any of them until the management company of our flat block pays the council to take them to a landfill site.

This left me with two options -- dump my recycling (in its non-recyclable bin-bag) on the ground and hope that someone helpfully puts it in a recycling bin once they are emptied, or the only realistic option: put them straight in the rubbish bins myself, immediately wasting all the effort my family put into separating them from non-recyclable waste.

Now I spent a year of my life[ working on technology](http://www.theengineer.co.uk/in-depth/waste-sorter/292460.article) for [Material Reclamation Facilities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_recovery_facility) -- the big sorting depots where your recycling ends up.  For better or worse (it's a weird thing to be geeky about) I know exactly what can and cannot be recycled locally, what happens to it when it is, and what happens to any "contamination" that makes it through. For my sins, I even know [what all the numbered codes on plastic bottles mean](http://reusablebags.hubpages.com/hub/recycle-plastic).  The net result is that my family and I are meticulous about what gets put out for recycling.  I would happily bet that none of the contamination is our fault.

But this isn't a "boo-hoo, I have to pay and it's not my fault" rant.  The fact of the matter is, I live in a block of 93 flats.  _Someone_ in one of those flats is going to be too lazy to sort their recycling or take it out of plastic bags.  _Someone_ is going to be unable to read the signs, or just to not care.  Probably not just "someone" but quite a lot of people.  It's unavoidable.

The council system is simply _broken_ for large flat blocks.

If a single family house gets their bin marked as "contaminated" and has to pay to have it taken away, maybe they'll learn.  But given human nature, a block of 93 flats is _always_ going to have contaminated bins, every single week.

Either the process needs to change, collectors need to be more tolerant of contamination, or else _there's no point giving us recycling bins at all_.  Just let us put it all out for rubbish and damn the environment, because that's what happens now, only right now it takes much longer and costs us all a lot more money.
