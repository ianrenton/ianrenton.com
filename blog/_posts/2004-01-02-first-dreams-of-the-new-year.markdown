title: First Dreams of the New Year
---

Admittedly, my only idea that the first dream of a new year should be special comes from Azumanga Daioh, but...  I wonder...  If only the dream I had two nights ago happened last night, it would have been awesome...  As it was, the dream was kinda' messed up and confusing and really stupid in the way lots of dreams are...  It was something to do with counter-terrorism, like being in the SAS or something, but all the things that happened, happened in either a desert, or a strange superposition of a hotel, a hospital, and Southampton Uni.  All I can really remember now is that it involved a lot of running around...
