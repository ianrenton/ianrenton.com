So apparently, a lot of people are gathering in Chicago right now to protest at the NATO Summit taking place there this week.

I need to get myself a plane ticket to Chicago, because I have problems with NATO.  Big, big problems.  And I won't stop until my voice is heard on this matter of vital importance to the future of the world:

Yeah. Listen up, America. No longer will we be enslaved by the yoke of oppression! No longer will I tolerate making PNG symbols in Photoshop using your PDF document as a reference!

In related news, the temptation to include this as an Easter Egg in the next version of my software is pretty strong:

Jokes requiring knowledge of NATO warfighting symbology and 1980s German pop music?  Oh yes, we're an equal opportunities blog. Absolutely _nobody_ has the opportunity to find it funny.
