A few months ago, I commented that I'd officially lost my student status, by means of paying over £4 for a panini for lunch.  

I believe I've now gone one better.  

This morning's breakfast cost me £20, and included a swordfish steak as one of the courses.  

That's worryingly more than middle-class...  Does that make me a toff now? o_O
