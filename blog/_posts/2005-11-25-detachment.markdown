Recently, I've been feeling awfully... separated, detached from reality.  It feels as though when I talk to people I'm not talking to them properly, and when I do things they don't properly happen.  It could be as though the world is just ever so slightly tinged with a kind of unfriendly distance.  The only thing recently that's felt properly real was last night's singing and dancing and cosplaying which, when I think about it, was pretty much a side-track from reality anyway.  

Everything feels so boring and only surface-deep.  I wonder why...
