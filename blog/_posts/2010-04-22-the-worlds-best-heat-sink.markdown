[![The World's Best Heat-Sink](/img/blog/2010/04/wpid-heatsink-224x300.jpg)](/blog/2010/04/wpid-heatsink.jpg)

From the [team](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/profile.php?id=1427833424&ref=ts) that brought you [AutoMouse](/blog/behold-automouse-product-announce) comes a revolution in heat-sink technology that you can recreate in your own home!

You will need:

  * A block of metal with holes in (burring optional but entirely reccommended)
  * About 3 gallons of thermal paste
  * Rubber bands

Simply affix to your hot components as shown in the figure, and pretend you're doing Proper Engineering!
