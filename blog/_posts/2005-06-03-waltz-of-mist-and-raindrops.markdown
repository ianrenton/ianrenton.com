So, there were plans today.  Shopping, Shakeaway, going to see Sin City.  In the end, it was just Mark and I who left the house to head into town under steel-grey skies.  

Fifteen minutes later, we'd made it as far as Faraday building where we stood dripping on the polished floor, sipping soup and coffee in the hope that the rain might stop.  It never did, of course, and after a few minutes the distant hill in the east became wreathed in thick white mist.  

We went back home.  Perhaps it was too much to expect something like fun during the exam season.  

For now... I revise.  Maybe later, if I'm lucky, I'll dream of June sunshine.
