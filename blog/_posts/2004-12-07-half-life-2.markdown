Gamers of a sensitive disposition may wish to turn away now.  

"Best FPS ever" my arse.  From my experience so far, I have to say I found Doom far more fun.  And I'm *not* talking about Doom 3 here.  And HL2 Deathmatch?  Excuse me while I play something that *doesn't* have broken sprites and models and BSODs whenever you Alt-Tab.  

Back to UT2004 for me.  Oh look - it has vehicles, better weapons, better maps, is much more fun, has proper Linux support, and actually sodding works.
