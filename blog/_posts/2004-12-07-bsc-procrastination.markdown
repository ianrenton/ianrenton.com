It's now been nearly a week since I went to Uni.  In this time, I've missed five lectures, a compulsory problem class, and three hours of compulsory labs.  Up until this morning, I'd also done no work at all in that time.  If there was a degree course in procrastination, I'd have an Honours.  But sadly I'm doing a Physics course, so the next two weeks are going to be insane with work.  The holidays are in sight, though - only two weeks left...  

Also, my apologies for the lack of updates recently.  An awful lot has been going on in my head, but since turning this blog into the usual angsty self-loathing LiveJournal fodder is going to achieve nothing, I decided not to publish two of the planned entries.  Anyway, despite all the mental weirdness of last week, I think I'm recovered now.  (Four days of oversleeping and overindulgence equals much regained sanity for me!)
