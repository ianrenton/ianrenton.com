title: Simplicity and Colour
---

Today, I talked about some things with people, and realised some things that I should have realised all along.  Life isn't confusing anymore, it's not messed up and I'm sane again.  The world is simple now; it makes sense.  

Walking home today, I breathed deeply in the rain-tinged evening air and my entire body filled with life and energy.  It felt like I was seeing in colour for the first time in forever, like I trailed coloured streamers as I walked.  

There's no longer any indecision, there's no longer any pain.  I'm free to go forward with life, to experience the new things being thrown my way with happiness in my heart.  And, I think, I can go forward at my own pace, or something only a little faster.  

Thank you, everyone who helped.  I'm happy again now.
