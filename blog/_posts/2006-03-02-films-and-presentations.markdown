Yesterday was fun! ^_^  Got taught how to play Battlefleet Gothic at Gamesoc, and it seems I've been roped into an ongoing campaign...  Should be good!  I'm probably going to get horribly owned, though... =S  

Went to see The Libertine at the Uni cinema afterwards.  Awesome, awesome film.  If you get a chance to see it, go!  Unless you'd be offended by, well, Johnny Depp porn.  Near enough, anyway.  

Next up: Third Year Conference presentation in 45 mins.  *nervous* *more nervous* *need more coffee* *need more Red Bull* *need more chocolate*
