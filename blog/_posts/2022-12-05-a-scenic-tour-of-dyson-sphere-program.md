If you know much about me, you'll probably know that I like "factory games" a lot. My stupid head won't let me relax at any point, but at least I can constantly improve, expand, optimise; each day ending in a better place than it began. [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) and [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/) have long been vices of mine, but recently I've started getting into [Dyson Sphere Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/)&mdash;and it is *gorgeous*.

Rather than spamming Mastodon constantly with pictures no-one cares about, I thought I'd share some of my favourites here.
