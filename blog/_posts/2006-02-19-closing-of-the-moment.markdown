The rain-tainted sky darkens slowly over the city, and friends depart; two by two, one by one.  Like all of my life these days, the last week has blurred out into a past I can barely remember already.  

Valentine's Day is over.  The wondrous AndyFest is over.  

It was fun, all of it.  It really was.  So much happened...  Making truffles, museum visits, lunch in town, Drool & Wooster, evenings chatting and drinking at home, the meal, the cake, the night out, the meeting for coffee that turned into an entire afternoon...  

Wonderful times; the stuff Forever is made of.
