title: The Result of the Battle
---

Written as a chapter quote for Dragon's Claw:

*"The result of a battle can not be gauged<br/>
by observing the plans of a strategist<br/>
or by listening to the commands of a general<br/>
only by looking into the eyes of the soldiers,<br/>
those destined to live or die by those plans and commands."*
