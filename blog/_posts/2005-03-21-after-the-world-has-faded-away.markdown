Today I think is proof that, no matter how productive I think I'd be, I should never be allowed to live alone.  The house is cold, and quiet, and dark, and empty...  And it's got me into the kind of state of mind where you're bored but yet there's nothing appealing to do...  

Although it'll be insanely busy, and expensive, I can't wait for Wednesday to next Tuesday - there'll be so much to do, and it'll be so fun...
