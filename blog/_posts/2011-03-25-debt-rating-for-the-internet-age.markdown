With the recent financial crisis, and unrest in the Middle East and north Africa, there has been much talk in the news of changes to countries' debt ratings -- usually for the worse.  But [their scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody's#Long-term_obligation_ratings), not to put too fine a point on it, is mad.

There's an A, B and a C, sure. But there's also Aaa, Aa1, Aa2, Aa3, A1, A2, A3... then we get to Baa, which is presumably index-linked to the country's sheep industry. Then beneath that are the "Junk" ratings, which rather than being something intuitive like "F", run the entire gamut between Ba1 and C, a total of 11 different levels.

I propose that, for the 21st Century, we establish a 21st Century naming scheme to replace these bizarre terms. The scheme would be intuitive and contemporary, and thus much more easily understood by the layman. The levels map as follows:

Moody's Rating

New Rating

  

C

FFFFUUUUUUUU-

  

Ca

Epic Fail

  

Caa

OMG

  

B

WTF

  

Ba

BBQ

  

Baa

LOL

  

A

Aa

Epic Win

"In light of recent unrest, Libya's debt has been downgraded from 'LOL' to 'WTF'." See? Simple. Intuitive.
