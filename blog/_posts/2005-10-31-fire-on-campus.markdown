The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/4390048.stm">fire that destroyed Mountbatten Building on Southampton University campus</a> made the front page of Slashdot.  I'm impressed!  

In case there's anyone at Southampton Uni who doesn't know yet, [http://about.susu.org/article.php?title=Latest+Mountbatten+Fire+Info](http://about.susu.org/article.php?title=Latest+Mountbatten+Fire+Info) seems the best page for information.
