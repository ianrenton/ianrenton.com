title: One of the worst nights out...

In the words of Chris, "Screw this shit, I'm done."  

Although part of it is kinda' my fault, it's been one of the worst nights out I've had here... as you can probably tell by the fact I'm back home at 10pm.  First off, I'm really tired and I don't feel too well.  Maybe the chicken I had for dinner was out of date or something, but my stomach ain't being nice to me this evening.  Added to that, we went to Jesters, which is possibly the one place I hate the most in this city...  and also, the four flatmates with whom I went out spent pretty much the entire time with their tongues down someone else's throat, so I rarely actually got to talk to anyone.  

That's a sure sign of a bad night.  I'm sober enough to use the word "whom" in a sentence.
