This week has gone approximately thus:  

* Went to see Eric.  Was awesome.  Spent too much money.  

* People at work are trying to convince me to play WoW.  There is no escape =S  

* I managed not to notice Comiket 70 happening.  There's a new version of Alibat!  <a href="http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php?t=55142">C70 Game Torrents</a>.  

* I ordered shiny rainbow-coloured poi from a nice site with prices in British Pounds and everything.  Turns out the things are actualy coming from New Zealand! =p  Ordered some UV-fluorescent body paint too.  

* <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJhuwihy7FE">I've had enough of motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!</a>  

* Last night was full of doom.  Hopefully, Eric doesn't hate me too much =S
