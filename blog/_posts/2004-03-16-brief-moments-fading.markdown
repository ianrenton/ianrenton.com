*"Hello, little star<br/>
Are you doing fine?  <br/>
I'm lonely as everything in birth<br/>
Sometimes in the dark  <br/>
When I close my eyes  <br/>
I dream of you, the planet Earth<br/>
If I could fly across this night  <br/>
Faster than the speed of light<br/>
I would spread these wings of mine <br/>
Through the years and far away<br/>
Far beyond the milky way  <br/>
See the shine that never blinks<br/>
The shine that never fades..."  *<br/>
- "Through the Years and Far Away", Hoshi no Koe Soundtrack  

A brief moment of happiness, that I hoped would last, fades away into tears and darkness...  Last weekend may have been one of the happiest of my life, but since then I've found yet another of my friends being depressed and having relationship problems, and recieved an e-mail from my mum telling me that I "should feel very much that I have let (my parents) down".  I've abandoned my foolish hopes that this week would herald a change from the depression of the last few months, since it obviosuly isn't meant to be that way...  

I wonder... is it selfish, to wish for happiness when others don't have it?
