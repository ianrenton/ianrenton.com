I felt compelled to write something, as I often do at 3am when it's beginning to get light outside and I really should be sleeping instead.  But I wrote anyway.  It's not long enough to constitute a real story, but if you're interested please take a look anyway.  Please bear in mind this hasn't been edited, and I'm not exactly at my best at 3am...
