Fittingly, today, the fog and the frost never lifted over Dorset, or at least my bit of it.  I headed into work half-heartedly, did nothing all day, and left at 2pm.  Even though I'm only off for two weeks, leaving the place and disappearing off into the mist has an odd kind of finality about it.  

Merry Yule, everyone!
