Somehow, this past week seems to have happened without me realising.  I've realised that it's remarkably easy to slip back into procrastination in this house, I've realised how much this place feels like home, and perhaps more importantly I've discovered that I have a 6000-word essay due in on Friday that I'm never going to be able to finish, a lab report and three problem sheets due in next week, then a week of exams for which I've not even thought about revising.  

But still, for some reason, I'm optimistic.  I guess it would be weird if it was otherwise.  But still, I sit here not doing the work I know needs to be done, sure that everything will turn out right in the end.  After all, it always does.  When I think about it, I can't think of anything that's ever happened that hasn't had some kind of up-side to it...
