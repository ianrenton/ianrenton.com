title: TFF Team Picker hits v1.0!
---

After a spree of lunchtime coding today, my Telegraph Fantasy Football Team Picker has finally hit v1.0.

It's a utility for football noobs (like me) who play the [Telegraph fantasy football](http://www.telegraphfantasyfootball.co.uk) game.  It scrapes players' past performance and injury lists from the web, and suggests the mathematically optimum team.

It's now available as a stand-alone Windows executable as well as a Python script.  It's GPLv3 licenced.  If you play TFF (or are just very bored), feel free to download and play with it!  Bug reports / feature requests are welcome.
