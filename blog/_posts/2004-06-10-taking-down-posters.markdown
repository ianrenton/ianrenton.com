title: Taking Down Posters
---

Taking down my posters, I can't help but remember the day on which I put them all up...

Packing away the year's work, I can't help but remember where I was and who I was with when I was working...

And all the other random junk I have around, that made this place my home.

There's something almost painful about leaving.
