Today just keeps feeling better and better as it goes on, although I can't really describe why.  Somehow, the cleaning and washing up and food shopping I'm about to do feel like they might even be fun.  Everything's sunny, and happy, and shining, without exception.  

And speaking of shiny, the card my parents sent me is shiny.  *Actually* shiny.  And gold.  With extra dragons.  ^_____^  Burthday card or not, that's becoming a tiny but nevertheless awesome poster.
