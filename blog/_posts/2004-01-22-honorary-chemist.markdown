Well, today was a really rather cool day!  I had my maths exam this morning... it was sorta' annoying that I didn't have time to finish all the questions that I could have done, but I think I did pretty well on the stuff that I did get to answer...  And, yeah.  I spent the afternoon playing Soul Calibur 2 at John's flat, which was pretty awesome, then I became an honorary Chemist for the evening and joined the Chemistry guys in Wetherspoons... and then we went on to Flares.  

Flares... <3... It's crowded and pretty expensive, but the atmosphere and the music are just great... late 60s, 70s and 80s dance tunes that I know the words to \o/  Scarily expensive though, my bottle of Miller cost Â£2.90... Ouch.  Anyways, as you can probably tell from the time of this post, I left early... I was really tired, having woken up at 7.30 this morning...  It was hard to leave that place though ^_^  

For some reason, the whole Dom drinking thing's got me kinda' emotional about the nature of happiness and that kinda' thing generally...  I guess having read a relevant section in The Matrix and Philosophy recently hasn't helped there...  Anyway, my comment on his blog says everything I wanted to say, although I'm worried I sounded too much like I was trying to tell him off or something... 0_0 Anyway, it's nothing like that at all.  

Anyways, off for sleep-fun now...  I've got a circuit diagram and lab book to write up for Electronics tomorrow or Friday morning, and the Electronics viver on Friday at 3pm, which means I won't be able to go home for tomorrow or Friday, but I'll try to make it home for the weekend...
