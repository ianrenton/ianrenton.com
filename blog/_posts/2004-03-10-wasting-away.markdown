I had to wake up four hours late today, missing today's lectures, just so I could get a sensible amount of sleep...  that can't be good.  I still haven't started the 1500 word essay that's in for Friday, and now I have to run to make it to this afternoon's Gamesoc meeting...  

I'm sure I've done this before, and.. at first glance it's quite disturbing, but actually reading all the text... maybe it's not *so* far wrong...  Bah, there goes Sundancer Saga for another few weeks!  Or maybe just a few days... Minamicon's shockingly close now!  Just two days...
