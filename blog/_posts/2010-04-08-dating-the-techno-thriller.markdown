There's little greater testament to the incredible pace of technological progress than the rate at which books set in the present day become dated.

Science Fiction, stories set in the far-flung future of interstellar colonisation, faster-than-light travel and so on, never seem to date unless they dare set themselves a date not far enough away -- the events of "[2001](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_%28film%29)" clearly haven't happened, but the technology is still somewhere distant on the roadmap of human achievement.  We still feel like we're going to get _there_ someday.

Near-future dystopias, [cyberpunk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk), they date much more easily.  Maybe, back in the Eighties, it did seem like the future was in virtual reality, cyberspace as an immersive 3D world of glittering corporate data-spires, jacked straight into your central nervous system.  But thirty years on, we have the internet and we watched [VR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality) be born and die.  We know that world is not quite where we ended up.

But the present-day equivalent stories -- I'm told these are "techno-thrillers", despite my initial impression that that was some kind of Michael Jackson bastardisation -- seem to date immeasurably quickly.

I'm currently reading "[Spook Country](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spook-Country-William-Gibson/dp/0670914940)" by [William Gibson](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/).  It was written less than three years ago, and heavily involves the technology that was contemporary then.  And by god, it feels old now.  The first chapter refers to a [PowerBook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook), and immediately the point in history the book occupies is precisely dated. There are clamshell phones with separate GPS receivers wired in; this book hit the shelves scarcely a few months before the iPhone came out, and three years later damn near everyone's toting a smartphone with a GPS.  Overlaying virtual objects on real space is edgy in their world, it's new, it's art.  In our world, we got bored of [Layar](http://layar.com/) months ago.  Cell-tower triangulation is advanced tech there.  In 2010, I don't know of a location-aware phone that _can't_ do that.

So unrelenting is the pace of technological change that what was cutting-edge three years ago is now jarringly antiquated.

Wow.
