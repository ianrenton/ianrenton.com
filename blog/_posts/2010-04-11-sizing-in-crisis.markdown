It's always confused me a little how, in most take-away pizza joints, the smallest size is 'Medium'.  Surely, by definition, it is not?  Maybe it's some sort of cultural adversity to buying a 'small' anything, but then surely they _would_ call the smallest one 'small' to coerce people into buying larger and more expensive pizzas?

Anyway, the most impressive taking of the biscuit belongs to Charmin toilet paper -- now called Cushelle, presumably as a stealth marketing effort once chavs start naming their daughters after it.  The available pack sizes are XL and XXL.  Nary a Large in sight.  But why, you ask?  The reason is obvious, if you merely horrifically misapply mathematics.

My first assumption is that their pack sizes increase exponentially, as with volume of pizza.  So if XXL is 12 rolls, and XL is 8 rolls, L would be... 5.333 -- clearly that's not the way it works.

So we must assume an arithmetic progression, giving that the missing Large size would be 4 rolls, the Medium 0 rolls, and the Small --4 rolls.

Suddenly, it all starts to make sense.  There is no Small size of Charmin toilet paper packs simply because _they can't afford to pay their staff to come to your house and steal four rolls of toilet paper every time you buy a Small pack_.

The strange thing about all of this is that I'm sober.  Perhaps it's time to rectify this anomaly?
