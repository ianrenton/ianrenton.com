So, today was... fun.  Not quite what I was expecting when I made the morning odyssey to work...  

As usual, I was getting odd looks from passers-by and the guards at the front gate, but then as I'm someone who carries an umbrella over one shoulder even on quite sunny days, I'm used to that.  As there's not much to do at work at the moment, I came prepared - all the stuff that I needed to write the next bits of "Hell on Earth" (I should make a page for this sometime) and <a href="http://www.rpol.net/display.cgi?gi=10542&gn=Neverwhere:+Stories+from+London+Below&threadnum=7">Second Star on the Right</a>.  This happily took up the part of the morning that I didn't spend eating, drinking and listening to <a href="http://www.geneon-ent.co.jp/rondorobe/music/kotoko/">KOTOKO</a>.  

At lunch, it transpired that of the twelve people who were supposed to come to a meeting today, only four of us were in fact left - to eat twelve peoples' lunch.  Which we got re-delivered to our office.  Doing so (well, not quite managing all of it - we gave about half of it away to friends and random passers-by) took most of the afternoon.  Then, after a quick mess around with some GUI changes that the customer wants for one of the programs we're working on...  It's suddenly five o'clock.  

It feels like no time has passed today, very much a change from the usual day's somewhat dull Solitaire and Minesweeper.  (I really should see if my computer meets the spec for Half-Life 2.)  

In other news, my parents went on holiday today, so I'm living in their house on my own for the next week and a half.  It feels a little odd, I guess.  Not as bad as it should do seeing as I've got all the disadvantages of living in my parents' house (having to be an obsessive-compulsive-washer-up, 56k pay-per-minute dialup) with all the disadvantages of living on my own (buying food, washing and ironing clothes)...  

Still, I have the internet.  Just about.  It's a start...
