For some reason, I've woken up with a really powerful feeling that I just don't belong, that no-one really cares... especially to do with the internet.  I don't know why, though... I can't explain *why* I suddenly feel this way for no reason at all...  

It's making me oddly tempted to give up on the internet, at least for a while.  But I think that's got to be a bad thing... What's more, seeing as I'm pretty much isolated here at Uni, that would mean taking a break from just about everyone, including all my friends.  So why does some tiny part of my brain suggest that that's a good idea?  

### Catching up - the last two days in glorious technicolour!  

First up, congrats to Adam (Adam) on... whatever's going on.  I don't really know what's going on (although I could make a few guesses) but whatever it is, it seems to be a good thing.  

Onto more random news, my musings over whether a samurai-style character in Dreaming Awake would be a good thing are pretty much solved, with the arrival of a new supporting character called Sansuke - created by an online friend.  Seems the old "Fanfic" thinking hasn't disappeared...  

And, annoyingly, it seems I can't rely on watching Pita Ten until my eyes fall out to make me mindlessly happy any more.  In fact, Episode 12 made me feel almost sad...  So there you go, it's a world first.  I'm almost annoyed that a series is developing a plot ^_^;
