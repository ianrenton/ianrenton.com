My work is fun, I guess... and I suppose watching TV and playing games at home are fun too.  At least, that's what I should think.  Yet, it's beginning to bore me after just a couple of weeks.  Every day is a routine, and every day will be, stretching forwards ahead of me across the summer.  

The clouds which cloak this island mirror the clouds in my heart, separating me from my friends in other places...
