title: Reciept for a Beginning of a Dream
---

And there was me thinking that the fairy dust she sprinkled over me would bring me dreams while I slept.  No, I was woken up and had no memory of dreams.  But half an hour later, a fragment of another kind of dream arrived in the post.  

It would appear that I've been offered a job.  

No CV, no interview.  

Â£20,000 a year, starting September.  

Working on an awesome project.  

It's surprising how one piece of paper can brighten up one's entire year.  

I know it's not a good idea to thank people for blessings, so I'll just announce my gratefulness generally to anyone who might be listening... ^_^
