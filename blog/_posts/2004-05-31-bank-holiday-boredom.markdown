Yet another catching-up post for what's been going on this weekend.  Basically, it's not a lot ^_^  

On Saturday night I went to see the Reduced Shakespeare Company's "All the Great Books - Abridged" which, as I was expecting, was brilliantly funny!  Student price was only Â£6, and definitely worth the money!  

Two new discoveries on Sunday night, due to the fact I was at my parents' house where such wonders as "television" exist.  First up, Kingdom Hospital.  Rather dark, amusing in places, and really rather good!  I definitely need to see more of this.  And secondly, yet *more* radio comedies that I used to listen to are making television appearances!  The Mighty Boosh (BBC3 only at the moment I think) is just as wonderfully silly as the original, but unfortunately Sunday night's episode of 15 Storeys High was cancelled, so I didn't get to see how the TV incarnation of that one turned out.  

And now I'm back in Southampton.  I think I've done all the revision I can usefully do for my Physics of the Solar System exam tomorrow morning, so right now I'm just sitting here being bored.  For company I have my copy of The Science of Discword II (which I've read before), a screenful of things that presumably make sense to a compiler but none at all to me (been going for 5 hours so far, estimated three hours to go) and an IRC channel full of people discussing how bored we all are.  Boredom must be infectious, huh? ^_^;
