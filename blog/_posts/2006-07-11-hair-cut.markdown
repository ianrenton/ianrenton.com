Dear me, I've been productive today.  I got not just one but *TWO* things done!  Oh yes!  I have both shaved, <i>and</i> had a haircut!  Yay, go me!  Stay tuned for the science bit:  

<b>+2 pts</b> My mother will no longer nag me to shave and cut my hair!  

<b>+2 pts</b> I now look "more like a graduate".  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-1 pts</b> ...but that's only according to my mother.  

<b>-2 pts</b> I no longer look like a beardy Frodo.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>+1 pts</b> ...but I still eat like a hobbit and flirt with male friends, so that's okay.  

<b>+2 pts</b> Now with extra shota potential!  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-1 pts</b> ...but I'll now get asked for ID in pubs.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-1 pts</b> ...but I'm not sure shota potential is a good thing anyway.  

<b>+2 pts</b> Eric won't complain anymore.  

<b>-1 pt</b> I no longer look like Tsuki.  

<b>TOTAL: +3 pts!</b> Banzai.
