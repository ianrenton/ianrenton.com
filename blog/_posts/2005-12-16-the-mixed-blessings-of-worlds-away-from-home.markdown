Whisky should perhaps not be regarded as a good substitute for sleep.  

I'm not sure what yesterday actually did, and despite a friend's intentions I don't think it did much.  I visited a nice place (except for the forest) and met nice people, and I would love to visit again.  But not now, not for a while.  That place isn't a home for me, nor will it ever be.  

Unfortunately I have to say that despite the fun I had there, the circumstances in which I came to be... invited?  forced?  ...to be there were somewhat less than what I was happy with.  If nothing else, I think I've come to understand Iza a bit better...
