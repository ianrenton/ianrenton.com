*"The world is moving so fast<br/>
No time for rest in this reality<br/>
Swung randomly on the roller coaster of life<br/>
Push on through constant strife<br/><br/>
Alone for a time under starry moon<br/>
Reflecting on an age long past<br/>
There’s no way back to that idyll now<br/>
Run along the path anyhow<br/><br/>
With everyone I dream of the future<br/>
Knowing that any day now it could be here<br/>
A thousand souls’ hope is burning<br/>
Now that yet again the Wheel is turning<br/><br/>
Running onwards is the only way<br/>
Embrace the new with every step<br/>
The future is for you and me<br/>
Upon this sunlit world, so it will be!"*
