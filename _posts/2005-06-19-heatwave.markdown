The weather today is insane.  It's gone midnight, my windows are open, and I'm sitting at my computer - wearing shorts, drinking water constantly and sweating from every pore of my body.  God only knows how I'm going to survive Spain...  

Also: I love Steam and ADSL.  I just downloaded Half-Life, entirely legally, in four minutes.  Scary.
