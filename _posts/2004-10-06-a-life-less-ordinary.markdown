It's a feeling, again, like the one I had when I first moved to Nothe Parade in Weymouth.  Suddenly my life isn't full of old things anymore, and there's a new and exciting world that doesn't mind me immersing myself in it.  And it's only the second time that I've been able to live in a house without the house owner being there too - this way, I feel like I can say "I live here" rather than "I'm staying here".  This house is full of interesting new things, just as my life is coming to be full of new and interesting experiences.
