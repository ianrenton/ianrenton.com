Righty, with poor old Suzaku now on its last legs and my parents declaring it a fire hazard, I'm putting together a new machine to pass the time until the Great DirectX 10 Splurge.  

It's going to be one of those Shuttle jobs, small enough that I can move it to the living room as a media centre PC once the Splurge occurs.  

The only problem is, what with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Tiger_(Chinese_constellation)">Byakko</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Tortoise_(Chinese_constellation)">Genbu</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Dragon_(Chinese_constellation)">Seiryuu</a> and shortly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermilion_Bird_(Chinese_constellation)">Suzaku</a> all having been packed off to the great Heaven of Obsolete and Dysfunctional Hardware...  I've finished my current cycle of names for my machines.  That means my new computer is still awaiting a name - so you can help me out!
