In the end, the afternoon and evening were better than enjoyable.  Really, I can hardly think of a way in which the day has been imperfect.  Nearly everyone was here, and we had so much fun in the afternoon sunlight and the warm evening.  There was pizza, and cake and a whole hamper-full of sweets.  Truly, I'm blessed to spend times like these with friends like these.  

Thank you, everyone, so much...  

*"I am life's flame!  <br/>
Respect my name!  <br/>
My fire is red my heart is gold-  <br/>
Thy dreams can be!  <br/>
Believe in me!  <br/>
If you but let my wings unfold!"*<br/>
