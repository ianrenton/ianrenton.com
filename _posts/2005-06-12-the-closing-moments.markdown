It's perhaps a bit odd that the thing that makes me realise how little time I've got left here is a BitTorrent client, but nevertheless that's the case.  One of my torrents is estimated to take a further 8 days to complete - whereas once I'd have dismissed that as "it'll finish eventually" and just waited until it did, now...  Now I don't *have* eight days.  That torrent will never finish.  

Only seven days, now, until I lose my beloved ADSL for three months...  Ten days until the party, Eleven days until I leave Southampton, thirteen days until Spain...  I'm running out of time, fast.
