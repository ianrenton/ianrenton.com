As a child, I remember, Christmas was a wondrous time full of happiness and joy.  Even as a teenager, although it had lost some of its wonder, I still remember looking forward to it.  Over time, though, our approach to Christmas was changing.  I guess the first thing it lost for me was a religious significance, then maybe when we got a fake tree, then when we started decorating half-heartedly, when my parents started hating having to cook Christmas dinner (yet would never let me help), when snow was only something from memories...  Gradually, I guess, Christmas lost its magic.  Now it's Christmas Eve and I'm not even vaguely excited.  I had no advent calendar to finish today, and my room's not decorated.  Slowly but surely, I think I'm learning what it means to be an adult.
