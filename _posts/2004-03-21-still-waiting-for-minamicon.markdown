I go home in less than two hours, back to 56k pay-per-minute dialup, and I'm still waiting for the Minamicon 11 website to appear... argh, this is going to be annoying!  

Also, I missed my alarm this morning, so I now have about an hour to get showered, dressed, have breakfast, pack up all my clothes, take apart my computer, put everything into boxes and get ready to leave...  Eeek!
