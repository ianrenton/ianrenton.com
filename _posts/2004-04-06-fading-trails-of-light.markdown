And now, truly the last day.  I got into town about a minute too late to see ER off at the station (sorry!)...  then, lots of Shakeaway, Maplins and Pump fun later, Char and MoFo left too.  

And so it was just the four of us Bournemouth people, heading our own ways from the station, into the evening light...  

This really has been one of the most awesome weekends of my life.  Thank you to everyone!!
