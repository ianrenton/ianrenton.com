It's been a really quiet day.  Downloaded some anime (Fullmetal Alchemist, Onegai Twins) this afternoon, spent this evening playing UT2k4 and watching more anime (Tales of Eternia).  

Also, I'm a lazy bastard.  I woke up at 2, and was really hungry.  Instead of getting lunch, I sat and stuffed my face with chocolate until 10pm, when I finally realised it would be a good idea to get some proper food.  But guess what, I couldn't be bothered ^_^;  So I got a sandwich.  That's the most substantial food I've had for about 30 hours now.
