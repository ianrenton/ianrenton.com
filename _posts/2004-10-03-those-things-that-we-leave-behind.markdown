The light slowly filters in through my condensation-covered windows, shedding a dull and depressing light over the room which is to become my home for the next nine months.  Somehow, despite sitting in a bright orange room, this seems like a place of greys, and of sleep.  Maybe that's just because Winter's coming, though...  

As I unpack al my stuff, I can't help but reminisce about years gone by, all the things I've done, and all the people I've met.  It seems that the past is ever an idyllic existence for my mind, a place saturated with emotion that I subconsciously escape to whenever the present is unemotional.  

Then again, perhaps the past really is a better place than the future.  The new University year ahead is quite scary when I realise just how much of last year's work I've forgotten...  

Right now I've got three days before Uni things start, but I don't think I'm starting off on the right foot.  I meant to wake up early this morning, spend a couple of hours cleaning the kitchen, then look through some recipe books for ideas before going shopping.  Instead, two hours have passed since I woke up and all I've done is unpacked some of my stuff, and stared into space listening to sad music...
