So, today has been weird.  

My first day at work, and thus back to the trivial level of human contact that it provides.  The previous week, I had more (barely-)human interaction with 4chan /b/ than with anyone else, which put me in a very strange mood for work.  

Now I'm back home, and pretty much straight into roleplaying online, at the expense of talking to Eric on the phone or being around my parents.  

I feel horribly detached.  This has historically meant that something really weird is about to happen.  Or, it could be a result of my banality 1,000,000 office.  Either way, feeling damn weird this evening =S
