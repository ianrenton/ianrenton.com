Ladies and gentlemen of the blogosphere, I am proud to announce the release of a new website.  This is what I have been winding up most of my Twitter followers for the last two months by referring to it only as "Super Secret Project #1".  Its name is [Westminster Hubble](http://www.westminsterhubble.com).

A joint venture between [myself](/) and [Chris Cox](http://recampaign.blogspot.com/2010/01/about-me.html), Westminster Hubble helps you stay in touch with your representatives in Parliament.

Each MP has their own page, which you can navigate to by searching by name, constituency or postcode, or by selecting from a map of the UK or a list of everybody in the database.  Here's an example for one of Westminster's most tech-savvy, [Tom Watson](http://www.westminsterhubble.com/Tom%20Watson).

On each MP's page, each item of their online presence is listed: their website, blog, Twitter account, Facebook page, and so on.  These are all editable, so that MPs or benevolent users can help keep their page up to date.  MP's profiles on TheyWorkForYou, the UK Parliament website and the Telegraph newspaper are all automatically linked to as well, and if they're on record, the pages also list MPs' constituency addresses and phone numbers.

Each of the online items is routinely checked for updates by Westminster Hubble, and from them a feed is created.  This feed forms the body of each MP's page, and is a filterable list of all that MP's activity on all the websites we know about.

Of course, you can subscribe to an RSS feed for an MP too (or even a single feed for all 650 of them, if you're that way inclined).  Just click the "Subscribe" button at the top of any feed.

So if you want a single feed of your MP's speeches in Parliament, blog posts, tweets and YouTube videos, [Westminster Hubble](http://www.westminsterhubble.com) is a new site that will give you just that.  If you want a single page that'll give you quick access to all their profiles across the internet, we do that too.

Please, spread the word!
