Freshly back from a work trip to Bremen at the end of May, they sent me off again for two weeks in Belgium at the start of June, to the exciting seaside destination that is [Zeebruges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeebrugge)&mdash;a town famous for its commercial port, its 1980s ferry disaster, and very little else. By and large our days there were long and consisted of "hotel, naval base, pub, hotel, repeat", but the event turned out a great success.

Most of my photos are singularly unexciting shots of grey boats trundling up and down in straight lines. But this one below I'm particularly fond of, not for its exciting subject matter (not so) or composition (likewise), but simply because it's the most *Photoshopped-looking* photo I've ever taken.

Between sea trials and industry days we did get a massive *four hours* to do the tourist thing and explore the nearby city of Bruges. In contrast to Zeebruges, a town that seems to exist solely to support its harbour, Bruges is an ancient city full of historic buildings and riverside restaurants.

To lead out, here's some of the better photos from the evening.
