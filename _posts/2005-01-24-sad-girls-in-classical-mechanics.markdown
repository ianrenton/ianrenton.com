I have a Classical Mechanics exam in an hour's time.  Revision?  No, that would be sensible.  Instead, I'm playing Kanon.  I guess, after all, I'm fairly confident about the exam now.  A productive half-hour yesterday reduced the entire book into one A4 sheet of formulae, which I think I now know all of.  So hopefully, the exam should be okay.  But in the same way that I didn't feel like anything important was happening in the build-up to Christmas, somehow I don't seem to feel that the exams are that important, either...
