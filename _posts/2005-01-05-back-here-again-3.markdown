I'm back in Southampton now, four days earlier than planned.  It's kinda' lonely here with no-one else around, but internet stuff seems to be taking up 100% of my time today.  Oh yeah, and I have tons of coursework to do.  Writing up lab papers for experiments I did three months ago, for a deadline I can't remember.  Joy.
