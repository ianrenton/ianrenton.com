Ladies and Gentlemen, today is a most rare occasion, one which I hope you will all in later years be proud to have experienced.  Yes, for the first time in no less than eight months...  

...I AM NOT DOWNLOADING ANYTHING.  

Yes, that's right folks!  No downloads for me!  My torrent queue is empty!  I am not leeching anything from eDonkey!  Even the Eternal Torrent (16.5GB of Maison Ikkoku) finished earlier this afternoon.  

I suspect this situation, rare and fantastical that it is, will last until approximately...  Two hours' time =p  

<i>11.18pm Edit: Whoops, I'd forgotten to download this week's Doctor Who.  Ah well, I lasted nearly ten hours!</i>
