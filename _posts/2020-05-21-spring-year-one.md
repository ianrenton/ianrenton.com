Spring, Year One. A new house, a new start, and our first ever garden of our own. We have survived the incredible stress of moving in the middle of a pandemic, and now at last I can put some of that time stuck at home to good use.

The previous owner left a garden full of weeds and a shed full of rusty old tools. Time to enjoy the Stardew Valley vibes then, while sat on a pallet drinking cider as the sun sets.
