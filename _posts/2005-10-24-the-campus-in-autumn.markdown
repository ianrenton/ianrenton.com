Years ago - four years, in fact, it seems a strangely long time - I had a feeling of what University life might be like.  Warm and comfortable, studying books or taking notes, while outside rain fell and cold winds blew leaves from the trees.  

It turns out that, now in the final autumn of my time here, I might have been right.  For a while, today, that was just how the world was.  

In the end, though, an existence that is just like that all the time would be lonely.  I'm so very, very glad that along with that kind of moment, the rest of my life is full of wonderful people and wonderful things.
