Today, Joseph has been mostly asking for metal things, so that he can test their ferromagnetic properties.  With a magnetic giraffe.  He has already discovered that things the giraffe attaches to are always metal, but that there are some metals to which it will not attach.

To put it another way:

**My son is doing the science.**  There are the beginnings of real, actual scientific method there.

This is the same kid that has previously tried to teach me about gravity and the water cycle.

I'm not sure if I've ever been this proud.
