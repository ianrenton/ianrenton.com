I'm glad, so very glad, that times like this exist.  Should I ever forget how wonderful my friends are and what a fantastic time I'm capable of having, all I need to do is remember days like today.  

I've decided now, I think, what life means; what's worth striving for.  Happiness.  That's it, it doesn't need to be any more complicated than that.  My happiness, other people's happiness, it's one and the same.  Today, everyone was happy.  And tomorrow will be the same inasmuch as I have a hand in it.  

<i>223 days remain.</i>
