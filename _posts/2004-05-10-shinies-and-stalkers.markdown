Okay, so... weekend.  I went back to bournemouth to see my parents, since I coudn't see them actually on my birthday.  I have much shiny stuff!  I have a USB keyring flash disk, which is quite awesome, and also a new optical mouse which should stop me breaking normal mice.  I have a *shock* legitimate copy of UT2k4, and a huge stack of CDRs that'll let me reclaim some hard disk space from the hordes of anime.  Also two new books (one of which I'm 3/4 of the way though already ^_^;) and some clothes.  And money too!  

We went out for a Chinese on Saturday, and went sailing on Sunday, so the weekend was really good and I didn't really get bored.  

Tonight, about half an hour after arriving back in Southampton, I went off to the Hobbit for the evening, which was pretty fun although we didn't get to spend very long there.  

Also, Flat 9 are beginning to worry me more and more ;;_;;  I can't leave or enter the building anymore without them shouting out my name and me going over to talk to them, it seems.  I don't know why it worries and kinda' scares me - really, I don't think it should do.  I guess... because they're unfamiliar people, and talking to all of them together is kinda' intense...
