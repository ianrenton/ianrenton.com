Exams so far:  

Optics, last Thursday: Very easy, expected 80%.  

Medical, today: Almost trivial, expected 80-90%.  

This is going well! ^_^  Shame the next two will be, I suspect, harder.  

Also, what is it with me, exams and dating sims?  I remember spending most of January playing Kanon instead of revising, and now I spent yesterday playing the new english translation of the HaniHani Operation Sanctuary demo.  *Curses his easily-distracted mind*
