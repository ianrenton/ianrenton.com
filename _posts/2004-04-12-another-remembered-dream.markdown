Last night's dream...  I've dreamt the same thing before.  Some kind of huge battle in the great hall of a castle, in medieval times, then going to sleep and waking up to find myself in modern times, with the castle a ruin and the central part of some kind of theme park.  Eager to get back to the castle, all the people (including me) who came forward in time break into this theme park together, but they soon disappear, leaving me on my own to dodge security guards in the forested ruins...  

I wonder if it's supposed to mean something...
