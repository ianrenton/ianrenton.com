For the attention of Racheet, Rhiannon and others with similar taste:  

I have found a new contender for the gayest anime series ever - yea, verily mayhap even gayer than Cluster edge and Meine Liebe.  It's at least a lot less subtle =S  

<a href="http://www.animesuki.com/series.php/790.html">Gakuen Heaven, aka "Boy's Love Scramble"</a>  

Unfortunately at least one other person may be required to watch this, since I don't think I can bear to watch it alone =S
