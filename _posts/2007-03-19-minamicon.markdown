Another year, another three days of <strike>anime faggotry</strike> alcoholism.  And now, despite being thoroughly knackered, I have to go to work and pretend to be conscious.  

Also, with estate agents coming on Wednesday morning, we now have two days to make the flat presentable - a feat I have not so far achieved on any of my days off.  Eric has the entire week off, which means... I'll probably end up doing all the cleaning myself in the evenings anyway.
