Vaccinations over and done with!  I am now resistant to:

  * Polio
  * Tetanus
  * Diptheria
  * Typhoid
  * Hepatitis A
  * Meningitis A, C, W & Y
  * AIDS
  * Cancer
  * Fire
  * Zombies
  * Acts of God.

Unfortunately, I still appear to be weak to:

  * Wind
  * Rain
  * Caffeine
  * People shoving sharp things into random bits of me.
