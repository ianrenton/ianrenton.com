So much work... and I'm just writing in my blog while my books are open on my lap, just finding something to pass my time rather than work...  I know that's bad, but.. my mind wanders like nothing else...  I've got tonight and tomorrow night to finish this lot, and I *will* manage it, even if I have to chain myself to the problem paper...  

Sigh...
