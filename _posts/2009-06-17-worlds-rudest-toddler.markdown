We appear to have unintentionally produced the world's rudest toddler.  His favourite words at the moment seem to be:

* "_a s√≠_", which he pronounces like "ass",  
* "cookie", which he pronounces like "cock",  
* and "_tete_", which alright is not exactly the dictionary word for "dummy", but is almost certainly ruder in English than Spanish.

Quite what the general public make of his pornographic babbling, I'm not sure...
