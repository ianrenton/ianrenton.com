More and more, recently, I've been seeing dawn from the other side.  4am no longer seems a late time to go to bed; in fact it's long since passed four and I'm not even tired.  

Just the same as last year, it's the sign that it's summer at last, and for everyone there's a feeling of relaxation in the air.  Everyone seems to care about the toils of life just a tiny bit less at this time of year, and I feel the hard-work gloom lift from over the city.  

The beat of my Heartsong quickens, its melody becomes more lively.  Unto the summer we go.
