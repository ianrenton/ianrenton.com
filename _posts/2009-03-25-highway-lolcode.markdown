Thus far, I have discerned the following differences between driving in the UK and Saudi Arabia.  They are presented here for your edification.

**Britain**

**Saudi Arabia**

Turning left(right) at a red light is...

Dangerous and illegal

Dangerous, legal and actively encouraged

Flashing your headlights means...

I am here

Get out of my fucking lane, bitch!

Speed bumps mean that you should...

Slow down

Try to ramp off the top of them at high speed

Driving without a licence is...

A criminal offense

Meh

Undertaking is...

Illegal unless in slow traffic or approaching a junction

Essential in order to get anywhere

Mobile phones to be used while driving

Zero

Two or more

U-turns on motorways are...

Illegal and usually impossible

An essential skill

...if you're in an articulated lorry...

Insane

+20 points

...with no side or rear lights...

OH HOLY FUCK

+30 points

Men's general approach to women drivers...

Wish they were banned

Wish they were legalised
