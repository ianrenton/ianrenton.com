This afternoon, we signed the tenancy agreement for the house! \o/  Also I have a new keyboard, so I can finally actually use my computer again!  

...and I've added Racheet, Rhiannon and Jodi to my LJ friends list, which I hope is okay and doesn't make me seem like a crazy stalker or something... ;;_;;  To round off today, one of those "small world" moments - Jodi and Ilphi seem to know each other (on LiveJournal, at least)...
