So, today I'm packing up my stuff...  Everything that I don't physically need for the next week.  Well, I say "physically need", but that list does include my computer.  ^_^;  Anyway, it feels really odd - no matter how many times I've moved over the last few years, I still don't really get used to this.  

Also, I find myself in the odd position of being a DeviantArt beta tester for the next week.  Can I find any new features to test?  Nope.  Is the deviation I submitted 10 minutes ago showing up yet?  Nope.  Can I re-submit it?  Nope.  Argh...
