I have now been up for over 24 hours, of which I've spent about 23 of them in the company of one individual.  My brain is melting.  I decided to go for a swim with Mark, but it only cleared my mind while I was there...  Now I'm back to the hayfevery sauna of the rest of the world, I have a headache and sore eyes again.  

Also, I am the least fit person ever.  I had to pause after every two lengths, and my heart rate was hitting 150.  Breast stroke.  Slow lane.  

All this sparring practice I've been doing has proved I still have the skill and agility I had a few years ago, but I think this afternoon's proved that I lack the strength and stamina.  More daily exercise for me, I think.
