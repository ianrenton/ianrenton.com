Today has been a silly day.  I present:

[Why LARPers should not have children.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tsuki_chama/3173944657/)

In related news, [why roleplayers should not watch pre-school television shows](/rpgs/darkness-falls-in-the-night-garden).  I will run this game one day, mark my words!
