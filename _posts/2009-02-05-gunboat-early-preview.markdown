As part of my irrational desire to teach myself OpenGL programming, I'm making a game that's (currently at least) called Gunboat.  It's a fairly slow-paced 2D shooter that has the player in command of a ship, protecting a harbour from an attacking fleet.

There's not that much of a game there at the moment (nothing happens if you beat all the enemies, nothing happens if you die...) but you can move around and shoot a few waves of enemies.

If anyone would like to play around with it, [you can get it from here](/software/gunboat).  Some degree of geek-fu is required to get it running, as there isn't an easy-to-use installer yet.
