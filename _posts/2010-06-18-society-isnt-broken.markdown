From Tory plans for communities to [create their own schools](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10345302.stm) to Guardian hacks [begging for alternative currencies](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/20/george-monbiot-recession-currencies), ex-Soviet [strategies for social collapse](http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2009/02/social-collapse-best-practices.html) to [alarmist talk](http://www.boingboing.net/2010/06/15/john-robb-interview.html) of counter-insurgency on American soil, there has been a lot of talk lately about the advantages of small, self-sufficient communities over the single one-size-fits-all approach of the nation state.  Half the world seems to think that, due to the economic downturn or by deliberate policy decision, the governments of the world won't be effective at ruling their nations anymore.

In the latter three cases, it reeks of scaremongering -- "The End is Nigh, prepare while you still can!"  But this kind of idea is infectious.  There's a secret thrill in imagining the downfall of society, and somehow a rose-tinted aura of romance around the idea of self-sufficiency.  There's something that feels good and honest about being part of a small community rather than just one citizen out of 60 million.

But there's a reason why, over the centuries, fiefdoms and tribal territories merged together into the nations we have today.  Being a small, self-sufficient community is _really hard_ and _you don't want to do it_.

Whatever scale of small community you pick, there are problems.

With a village, maybe you can be self-sufficient on food provided you have enough arable land and people to farm it.  But you'll all be getting by at the subsistence level, your quality of life will be poor.

With a group of villages working together, you can grow more things, your diet gets better and you get more resistant to crop shortages and disease.  But that's the kind of issues we're still talking about.  Economic doomsayers who suggest that this is the kind of community we should be working towards are suggesting we revert our massively successful first-world country to third-world near-poverty.

With towns working together, finally we see infrastructure, healthcare, education.  But we still can't afford to defend ourselves.  Effective police forces and militaries, and with them the public's confidence that they can go about their daily business with little risk of assault or invasion, only really become possible at the level of the nations we live in today.

Splitting up into self-sufficient communities becomes even more difficult because the infrastructure we've built up over thousands of years of _being_ a country doesn't lend itself well to being split up again.  Case in point: I live in a conurbation, a fusion of three towns that's home to around 400,000 people.  How much farmland do we have within the boundaries of this conurbation?  Oh, _none_.  How would we feed that many people?  Well, we'd have to absorb the rest of Dorset (population 700,000) into our community.  Suddenly it's not small and romantic anymore.  We might as well call it Wessex and find someone called Alfred to be king of it for about 5 years until Athelstan 2 turns up.

To top it all, _we ourselves_ have, through thousands of years of moving away from this lifestyle, become incompatible with subsistence-level communities.  They're not going to have a lot of demand for autonomous vehicles, or for warship combat system designers, or even (god forbid) bloggers.  What if -- and I know this is going to come as a shock -- the hairdressers and management consultants and advertising executives that live on my street turn out to _not be very good at farming_?

No, it's not going to work.  Nations are what we have, and nations are what we have to stick with for the foreseeable future.  If the econopocalypse brings down governments, makes them inefficient, so be it.  What we have to do, and luckily what happens naturally, is try our best to fix them.

As a country and a collective body of people, all we ever do is the bare minimum to ensure that life carries on as normal.  And for once, that's not a bad thing.  When our society breaks in little ways, we need to find little ways of patching it up.  If the Tories' "free schools" work, then great -- it's a little patch to a problem which is tiny, if it exists at all.

But politicians telling us that "Britain is broken!" and bloggers telling us to prepare for a life of subsistence farming just aren't helpful.
