They reckon it'll hit 28 degrees C today.  Summer's truly here, at last, and I don't feel that it's possible for me to be unhappy anymore.  Many things begin and end at these times, when it feels like the sun's heat ignites my wings with light.  Despite the endings, we've got no choice but to go out on a high note, and that's the way things always should be.
