As I stand here at dawn, I am reminded that a wonderful life has only just started, and every new day is filled with hope...  

As I walk here in the day, each step reminds me of the happiest things I have done...  

And as I stand here at dusk, with the wind blowing through my hair and rain on my face, I think how all those happy things... were when I was a child... And now all I'm doing is standing on top of a windy hill and dreaming. Does that mean... I'm not a child... any more?
