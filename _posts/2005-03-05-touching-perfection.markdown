I'm not sure why tonight seemed so oddly perfect, but... it just did.  Nothing particularly special happened, but perhaps that was part of what made it perfect - simply that everyone was there, and everything was just as my imagination would suggest that it should be.  One of the many days that will forever define the memories of my friends.
