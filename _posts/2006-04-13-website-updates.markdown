This evening I spent n hours (where n is too many) redesigning my site a bit due to an idea I had earlier in the day.  Behold its shiny shiny glory!  

<a href="http://ianrenton.com/">http://ianrenton.com/</a>  

Probably goes against every web style "rule" ever written, but what the heck.  Certainly suits the site more than the previous two versions.  

But look!  It uses CSS *almost* properly!  And it looks vaguely similar in Firefox and IE too!  It's a breakthrough!
