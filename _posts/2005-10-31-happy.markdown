Happy Hallowe'en / Samhain / Overly Americanised Autumn Festival to you all!  

Today I mostly spent recovering from the weekend - by forgetting to set my alarm, skipping two lectures and completing a problem sheet in a rush.  Still, I'm feeling better now.  So yay, on with life!  

Tonight I thought I'd write something for Hallowe'en.  I'm not particularly fond of it, but I guess it's not bad for a story that took me two hours from first idea to completion.  It's called "The Faeries' Adventure", and it can be found at:  

/fiction/the-faeries-adventure 

Enjoy!  Comments and criticism appreciated, as always!  

<i>EDIT: Actually, that really sucks.  Expect a rewrite sometime soon.</i>  

This may be a not-particularly-comparable writing task to make up for the fact that I'm not doing NaNoWriMo.  I just don't have the time...  ;;_;;
