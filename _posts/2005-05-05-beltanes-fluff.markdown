Yet again, dandelion seeds blow in the wind and the sun beats down from a brilliant blue sky.  I'm so glad to celebrate at this time of year, when the world glitters so wonderfully...  

*Side note:  If you've used microsoft.com or windowsupdate.com recently, you'll probably realise that they now check for a valid Windows licence before allowing you to do anything.  I assume you need a copy of Windows that's been properly registered with a serial number that isn't one of the ones passed around with cracked copies.  However, um...  WINE running under Linux validates just fine.  I profess myself a little confused ^_^;*
