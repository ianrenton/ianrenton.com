There's a feeling, or perhaps it's more like a lack of a certain feeling.  Everything in life seems lighter, happier, more easily dealt with.  I think, for the very first time in a long time, I'm not angsting.  

I'd forgotten how good it felt.  

Last week's problems seem now... skipped over, if not actually dealt with, but the effect is much the same.  The problem with running the game on Saturday vanished along with Saturday, and I have at least a little confidence in my ability to run it now.  

And then there's Angst Cause #1.  Now that I think about it, though, there's little to angst about.  I've made a decision, everyone who knows supports my decision, so it's time to go ahead and try.  Now it's just a matter of courage and cowardice, of nervousness and resolve.  But not angst, not angst anymore.  For now, anyway.  

For now, all I have to do is...  make opportunities.  And use them.
