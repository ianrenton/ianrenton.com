So... another weekend wasted.  I should have done more work, I shouldn't have spent the whole of this afternoon in the pub, and I certainly shouldn't have spent as much money as I have done.  Somehow, before Thursday morning, I have to do 11 hours of lectures, go shopping, do my laundry, visit the estate agents', play Exalted, play Mage, *and* do three problem sheets, two of which actually require re-learning the material since I wasn't awake enough in lectures to actually pay attention.  This week is gonna suck.
