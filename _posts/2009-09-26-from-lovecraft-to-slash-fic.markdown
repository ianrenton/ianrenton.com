So, as Joseph's tastes in kids' TV shows changes, so does the range of programmes I have to complain about, comment on, and generally be weirded out by.  Thus I have probably posted the last of my "Night Garden = Ry'leh" brainfarts on this blog.  On we go to the next thing he's exposing me to non-stop.

Right, in Thomas the Tank Engine, is it just me or are Rheneas and Skarloey totally gay for each other?

That is all.
