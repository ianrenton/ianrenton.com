Okay, my sleep cycle is now almost amusingly screwed.  I'm just about having time to do the work I need to do, although I have presentation doom in a week's time, but I'm just not getting up in time for any of my lectures...  I really need to get properly into motivated mode, even if it means going to bed before midnight most days.  

Also, my hard disk diead again on Tuesday.  Ah well, at least that's 120GB less distractions.
