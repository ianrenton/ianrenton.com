About 8 this evening, we debated what to have for dinner.  It was decided that there should be roast potatoes...  a while later, chicken was theorised...  then a bunch of other vegetables...  

Two hours later, there was roast dinner.  Chicken roasted with garlic oil and herbs; along with potatoes, carrots and onions, roasted in honey and ginger dressing; and stuffing.  I feel rather proud, it turned out pretty well.  It's not helping me revise Thermal Physics, though.  The exam's tomorrow afternoon, and revision for it is ridiculous - so many formulae to learn, and forgetting even one of them could screw up the paper completely...  

Ah well, gotta' look on the bright side.  Everything'll turn out for the best in the end, it always does.
