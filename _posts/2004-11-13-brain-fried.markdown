This afternoon I had the Physics Lab session from hell.  This evening, I spent most of my time playing Kerplunk as a drinking game.  I haven't slept for 40 hours now.  And, I have to get up in 6 hours' time to go to London.  

I feel extremely weird, although I'm at the same time ecstatically happy.  I have no idea why...  

(Apologies for the randomness of this post.)
