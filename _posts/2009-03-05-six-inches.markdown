Six inches of snow this morning!  Settled!  In March!  In *Bournemouth*!  That just... doesn't happen.

This morning was convoluted.  Went to my normal spot to be picked up, car pool had got the train instead.  Got drenched.  Caught bus into town, bought umbrella.  Waited 15 minutes.  Got bus to station, bought coffee, caught train.  Waded through snow for 35 minutes.  Finally rolled up at work at... 10:15.  Woohoo!
