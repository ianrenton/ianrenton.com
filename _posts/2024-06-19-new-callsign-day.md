I'm happy to say that for the third, and possibly final time, it's New Ham Radio Callsign day for me!

Over the weekend I finally got around to sitting my Full amateur radio licence exam, thanks to the great help I received from the [Online Amateur Radio Community (OARC)](https://www.oarc.uk/).

In the UK we have callsigns based on our licence level, so out with my old 2EØUXV callsign, and in with my new one, MØTRT.

I would like to say it means something, but in reality I wrote some code to calculate all the unassigned MØ calls based on [Ofcom's list of assigned ones](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/manage-your-licence/amateur/amateur-callsigns.csv) (CSV), remove all the ones with sequences & letters I didn't like, then picked the one with the smallest, most satisfying Morse code form.

If anyone who isn't a massive nerd asks, it stands for "mo' trout". Everyone needs mo' trout in their life.

See you on the air!
