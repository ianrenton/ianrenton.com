The weather, like the best of muses, is capricious and arbitrary.

Yesterday I had no problem at all catching buses and trains to get from our home to Guildford, a good hundred miles away.  Guildford was under 3-4 inches of snow, complete with the requisite ice underneath, so using the pushchair was a challenge -- but we made it.

This morning, an inch fell on Bournemouth.  And paralysed it.

The photo below is Queens Road this morning, which naturally, the council have not gritted.  Of course not, I mean, it's only a 1-in-5 hill on a bus route.  Why would they want to grit _that_?

With my carpool absent, rail services reduced and no buses going my direction as far as I could tell, I gave up and for lack of anything better to do, started gritting Queens Road myself.  See that non-snowy bit? That's a productive morning right there.

So, no work for me today, and since my laptop is also at work, I can't pretend to be working from home.  On the other hand, a lot of drivers looked pretty happy -- and the falling snow has been replaced by rain, so hopefully the town will have resumed normal service again tomorrow.
