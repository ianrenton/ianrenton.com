Good News:  I have another short story lined up after I (hopefully imminently) finish the two I'm currently working on, and - this is a new thing for me - it WON'T BE ANGSTY.  Got that?  Beat me with haddock if I even verge on making it the slightest bit angsty.  

Bad News:  I want the main character to be called Caramel.  I don't know why.  Feel free to comment telling me how dumb a name that is.
