*"Can you still see your dreams in the distant, starry sky?<br/>
Are they more vivid than they were when you were little?<br/>
When one forgets to put the emotions that overflow in her heart to rest, they burn the color of passion.<br/>
I used to believe without a doubt that I could reach my dreams, no matter how far off they were.<br/>
But that me from long ago now sleeps inside my heart.<br/>
Dreams are more fragile and fleeting than a glass rose,<br/>
so then why are we destined to dream?"*<br/>
&mdash; "Scarlet", opening song from Ayashi no Ceres

For years I've dreamed my dream, and always shall I dream it...

It always used to inspire me, full of hope and burning desire for the future. But now, the time I dreamt of has passed, and now I'm left feeling as if my time is running out... I've got years of life planned ahead of me, and there seems to be no time for the adventure I still yearn for...

Is this the fate of all people born in modern times, to have their adventures confined to dreams, and never more real than a whisper of thought...?

*"And the Dreamer shall break loose the chains of Fate,<br/>
and the Light shall guide him unto his Dream."*<br/>
&mdash; From the Prophecy Of The Dreamer
