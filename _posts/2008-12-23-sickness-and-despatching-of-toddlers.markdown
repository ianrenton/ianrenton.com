Today's the third day that Joseph's spent off around the place without Eric or I, and for once I feel kind of guilty.  The previous two days he was kind of a pain, but so far today he's been soppy and cuddly, but I still have to give him away.  Unfair! D=  Still, I'm not exactly feeling great this morning, so going back to bed is a remarkably appealing idea.

I wish I was more constant in my feelings for Joseph, really.  On a calm, cuddly day I don't want to see him go, but on an annoying screamy day he can't get out of here fast enough!

Anyway, to bed.  Or Rock Band 2.  There is that...
