Right, I'm off to see my mum for her birthday.  I'll be back tomorrow afternoon for the other two birthdays this weekend!  

A lot of people I think have wanted to borrow stuff of mine that's at my parents' house, so now is a good time for me to go and get these things.  Unfortunately, I'm stupid and have forgotten most of them.  I remember Eric was after Discworld books, but aside from that I can't remember any.  

I won't have 'net access from about 15 minutes' time, so if you want stuff calling or texting is the way to go.  See you all tomorrow!
