Earlier this year, Green Day announced a number of special releases to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their album Dookie. My first reaction was, of course, *"oh god what no, it's not thirty... of fuck, please stop reminding me that I am middle-aged!"*

Once I got over the shock, I checked out [Dookie Demastered](https://www.dookiedemastered.com/)&mdash;a version of the album where each track is available in very limited quantities on one of a number of odd 90s media choices.

And oh shit, one of them is a Billy Bass!

Now the problem with the *Demastered* collection is that each item was released as a raffle, and for the Billy Bass that sings Basket Case, it was $79 a ticket *just to enter*. You know what's also about $79? [The BOM cost of making your own.](https://ianrenton.com/projects/big-mouth-phatt-bass/bom/)

And since I already have my own modded Billy Bass, of course I taught it to sing Basket Case.

You can check out Green Day's version [here](https://www.dookiedemastered.com/), and see who did it better! (It's them, of course it's them. They probably paid someone actual money for it, and it took them more than half an hour.)

My version only does the first 45 seconds, the rest is left as an exercise for the reader if you wanna risk being sued by Green Day or something. Have fun!
