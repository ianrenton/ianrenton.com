The costume shop down the road has the <b>MOST AWESOME FROCK COAT EVER</b> in the window...  It's my size and everything, and it's really well-lined and comfy and it's purple and black with frilly bits on the cuffs and everything and ohhhh, how I want it...  

But it's Â£15 to hire for just two days, and they're not selling it...  

Curses!  ;;_;;
