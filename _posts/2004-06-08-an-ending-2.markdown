Staring out of the window this afternoon, it seems like hardly any time at all since we arrived here.  And in so short a time, we made this place our own, and now all of a sudden we're leaving again...  So I guess that means a third of my time at University is done.  Only two years left.  I guess I'm being childish when I say I wish it could last forever - but I do, I really do.  Every day here is full of wonderful feelings and wonderful people...  When I think of some of the adults I know - how rarely they see their friends, and how lacking in emotion and adventure their lives are...  Why?  Why would people want to be like that?  I want to always live like I do now...  

But then, I guess that's nothing but a childish thought as well.  In time, I suppose, I'll think differently.  

*"Never thought  <br/>
This day would come so soon  <br/>
We had no time to say goodbye  <br/>
How can the world just carry on?  <br/>
I feel so lost when you are not by my side  <br/>
But there's nothing but silence now  <br/>
Around the one I loved  <br/>
Is this our farewell?  <br/>
So sorry your world is tumbling down  <br/>
I will watch you through these nights  <br/>
Rest your head and go to sleep  <br/>
Because my child, this not our farewell.  <br/>
This is not our farewell."  *<br/>
 ~ Within Temptation - Our Farewell
