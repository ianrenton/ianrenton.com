Eric and I went swimming yesterday, and encountered another pregnant lady - cue half-hour impromptu womens' meeting!  I guess pregnancy is top of the list of "things that you can have in common with strangers that you can strike up conversations about".  Anyway, the end result of the meeting is that Eric now has detail for a antenatal fitness class, which might not be a bad idea.  

Today, I failed to make brownies and instead played Disgaea 2.  I am irredemably lazy.  Tonight, roast pork!  It's cooking away now, and the potatoes are taking ages.  (I suspect this may be a curse of mine; every roast dinner I cook in any oven, the potatoes always take longer than I expect...)
