My life is full of really rather doomful work at the moment, and my blog may have to suffer for a while.  Sorry!  

My final report deadline is in 12 days now, and the project isn't even in a condition where it can be tried out to see if it has a chance of working.  Also problem sheets, exam revision, and the fact I'm extremely broke, and that Eric's no longer here.  Much stress and doom.
