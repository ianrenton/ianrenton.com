Since I got my eeePC, I've been experimenting with streaming music from the 'net rather than from the hard disk of my desktop.  I've come to the conclusion that my music collection has been somewhat surpassed by Last.fm.  

I've been scrobbling for probably a year or so now, to the point that listening to Last.fm's recommended tracks and Neighbour Radio is a lot like listening to my actual music, only more varied, more interesting, and - as now - interspersed with random German filk.  

Clearly I have taught it both what I like, and what I find oddly amusing =p
