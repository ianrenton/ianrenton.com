It's been so long, you know, since I first came here.  Back then, I was so unsure of myself, and so - in a way - scared of those around me.  I think, back then, innocence was the one thing in the world I prized the most.  So much so that it was something I strived to keep as much as possible, and so much so that my easily-breakable nature that appeared as a by-product created a hobby for my friends.  

It's been nearly three years, three years of learning and three years of change for all of us.  

In my first year, I learned a bit about what life is.  

In my second year, I learned a lot about what friends are.  

And now, in my third and final year here, I'm coming to learn who I am.  

I guess, in more ways than one, I'm not so innocent anymore.  It's been a gradual process, but I'm not quite so breakable now.  It really brought it home a few weeks ago when I managed to disturb Zane - a feat I'm not sure anyone else appears to have managed.  All I said was one word, but in front of someone who didn't believe me capable of uttering such a word...  It's all in the timing, it really  

is.  Even if the timing involves two and a half years of waiting.  

More and more, these days, I'm becoming fully myself.  And I only have my friends to thank for it, so...   Thank you!
