Nearly six months ago, I [sketched out some ideas](/blog/daily-promise-design-sketches) for a site then called "healthi.ly", since renamed to [Daily Promise](http://dp.onlydreaming.net).  In time I coded it up, made it public, and made the same commitment I have to other sites in the past -- [20 active users](/blog/announcing-daily-promise) gets it its own domain and investment of time and effort.  Less than that, and it goes how it goes.

It never did make it to 20 users.  Its height was around 10, and has since fallen to just two.  Today, it falls to one.

I am leaving _Daily Promise_.

It remains where it is, costing me nothing, ready for use by anyone should they so wish.  Its [source code](https://github.com/ianrenton/dailypromise) is still public, for anyone to grab and build upon.

I'm leaving simply because it doesn't, after all, help me keep my promises -- it merely helps me monitor them.  I never found myself striving to beat my record, never felt a pang of guilt as I ticked a row of "no" boxes.  I merely carried on as normal, not changing my lifestyle, just monitoring my behaviour as a set of green and red boxes that were at first fun, then over time became a chore.

Two apologies are due before I lay it finally to rest:

  * Firstly to [@HolyHaddock](http://twitter.com/HolyHaddock), who submitted a patch that would allow _Daily Promise_ to allow "do this x times per week" promises -- a requirement for his use case.  Unfortunately it broke the way _I_ used it, and I never worked up the enthusiasm to merge the two properly.  So my apologies for your wasted effort.
  * Secondly to [@telli_vision](http://twitter.com/telli_vision), who outlasts me as the only remaining user of _Daily Promise_.  My apologies for leaving you on your own, and I hope that the site remains useful for you.

And of course, thank you to all the users, everyone who offered their comments during the design phase and everyone who submitted bug reports since.

_Daily Promise_ belongs to the world's ever-increasing body of free software.  If you like it, use it.  If you don't like something about it, take it, build on it, and make it yours.  I'd love to hear from you.
