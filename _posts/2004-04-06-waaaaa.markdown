At various points in my life I've had dreams that seem to be pretty much a part of the Dreaming Awake storyline... but this morning...  this morning I dreamed of DA's finale.  Golden spears and magic swords and everything.  Complete with the uber-headfuck moments too.  Yay for messed-up-ness.  

Also, I *tried* to start taking my antibiotics this morning.  Looks like, even at 18 years old, I still can't swallow pills...  I win the prize, TBH...
