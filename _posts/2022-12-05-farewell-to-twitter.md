It seems strange to say now, in the closing days of 2022, but once upon a time... Twitter was cool. Initially called "twttr", it was a new and exciting thing&mdash;"micro-blogging", they called it. Messages were limited to 140 characters because you could post them via SMS; no retweets, no "likes", and no hashtags, which hadn't been invented yet.

I joined in February of 2008, with an ensuing flurry of pointless posts and over-sharing which would come to define most of our times there.

In a few years, it grew and expanded into one of the darlings of "web 2.0", with open APIs that allowed anyone with some programming knowledge to interact with it. I wrote my own client, ["SuccessWhale"](https://github.com/ianrenton/SuccessWhale/) (its name a pun on Twitter's "fail whale" error screens).

But before long, things took a turn for the worse. With an understandable increasing drive to get eyeballs on adverts and make a profit, Twitter became increasingly hostile to third-party clients that allowed users to interact with the platform sans ads. And on the social rather than technological side, it began to gain a reputation for *somewhat fraught* discourse, and worse, becoming the "hell site" we lovingly knew it as.

And that more-or-less brings us up to 2022. Earlier in the year, when Elon Musk was rumoured to be buying the plaform, I thought the idea of abandoning Twitter when he took over was needless overreaction&mdash;the service would carry on, who cares who's at the top really? But over the last month, the reality has been much worse than expected. From the [shameful way in which staff were sacked en masse](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/technology/elon-musk-twitter-fired-criticism.html), to the [crumbling infrastructure](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/08/1062886/heres-how-a-twitter-engineer-says-it-will-break-in-the-coming-weeks/) that's resulted, and now to the [re-instatement of right-wing accounts](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/29/banned-british-far-right-figures-return-to-twitter-within-hours-of-takeover) and [banning of left-wing activists](https://www.businessinsider.com/left-wing-activists-banned-from-twitter-after-false-report-2022-11?r=US&IR=T), it's clear that Twitter is moving in a direction that I don't care to be a part of.

My Twitter account has been cleaned out now, 14 years of crap washed away, replaced by a mere placeholder to give my reasons and my forwarding address at Mastodon. (It's [@ianrenton@mastodon.lol](https://mastodon.lol/@ianrenton), if you'd like to [make the jump](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/confused-by-twitter-replacement-mastodon-heres-how-to-get-started/) with me.)

See you, hell site. I won't miss you.
