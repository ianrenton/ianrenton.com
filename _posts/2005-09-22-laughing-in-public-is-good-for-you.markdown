Two moments of public lollage today, much to my embarassment.  

The first, at the train station...  

Rammstein (in headphones): "Let me see you stripped..."  

*guy next to me starts taking off his jacket*  

And secondly, on the billboard advertising today's Echo headlines...  

"Accident shears off bus roof!  

414 jobs inside."  

With hindsight, I'm not sure why I found either of them that funny, but still.  Ah well, have a meme.  

  

Nine days to go.
