For the third time in two days, it's snowing outside...  That thick, fairytale-like snow that blows around on the breeze as it drifts towards the ground - that kind of snow that barely looks real, it looks like the only place it belongs is in the props department for a movie company.  It's the kind of snow I feel blessed to have seen.
