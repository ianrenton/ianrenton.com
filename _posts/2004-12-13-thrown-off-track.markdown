I guess I shouldn't be surprised...  When they advised us that we should do the Data Handling problem sheets every week during the term, it looks like they were right.  Doing the remaining five by lunchtime tomorrow is *not* happening.  

The whole "new housemate" thing has thrown me completely off-track, and I've spent much more time in the last two days cleaning the house than doing Uni work.  Thankfully, Data Handling is only 2% of the overall grade in two modules, and if I manage to do one more DH problem sheet tonight or tomorrow then I'll only have dropped 1%.  

When compared to the horribly low mark that I might be on course for in Photonics, that's hardly anything.  

Current odds on getting a First this year: Pfft. Don't make me laugh.
