The full Bill of Materials for the Plane/Sailing project is as follows. I have updated the costs as of July 2021.

If you're recreating the build for yourself, you have some options:

1. I found the Raspberry Pi starter kit to be a convenient and cost-effective way of getting a Pi, case, power supply and SD card all in one package, but if you have some of those already lying around, you can of course break this line out and buy components individually.
2. A lot of the cost here is in SDR dongles, so for example if you were only interested in AIS and ADS-B, not APRS, you could save at least Â£30 by skipping one RTL-SDR and the cable splitter.
