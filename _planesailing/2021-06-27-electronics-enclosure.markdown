With a pi, three RTL-SDRs, a separate pre-amp for AIS and miscellaneous other clutter on my desk, it's no surprise that the Plane/Sailing build was getting rather messy...

As well as just looking bad, the SDRs had a minor overheating problem, with them all packed close together, and also a stability problem&mdash;an accidental wobble on an antenna cable meant loss of USB connectivity, from which the connected application does not always recover.

I have updated the [bill of materials](/hardware/planesailing/bill-of-materials/) with a list of the components used to build an enclosure for the project that will keep it neat and tidy, plus offer some extra heat sinking capability for the Pi and SDRs.

### Build Steps

My first step was to mount the Pi in a metal "heat sink" case that should provide more heat dissipation than a normal Pi case (this is actually visible already in the photo above). It comes with small adhesive pads to thermally connect the major components on the board to the metal heat sink.
