Having put together the [antennas, receivers](./antenna-and-receiver/), [Raspberry Pis and processing software](./raspberry-pis-and-processing-software/), the finishing touch for the Plane/Sailing project is the web interface by which the data is displayed to the end user.

Luckily, I had already done most of the hard work in [UMID1090](https://github.com/ianrenton/umid1090), the predecessor to this project:

*UMID1090 Interface*

For Plane/Sailing, I decided to drop some of the more complex options for configuring the software, and instead go for a full-screen map with only a few options hidden inside pop-out panels. I used the dark map background, blue highlights and [Exo font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo) from my [Career Explorer](https://careerexplorer.ianrenton.com/) to give it a more futuristic feel. It's not just an unnecessary military interface, it's an unnecessary *Hollywood military interface*.

Version 1 provided a more limited set of options and no track table:

Version 2 re-added UMID1090's track table, and brought across a few extra configuration options.

And that's it&mdash;job done! ‚úà‚õµüéâüç∫
