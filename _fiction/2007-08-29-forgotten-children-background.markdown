<p>This page lists some of the important political events during the past of Forgotten Children, showing how their society came about as the result of a chain of events beginning with Earth as it is today.</p>
<p><b>2359</b><br />
Thanks to its skilful political manipulation amidst the break-up and demise of the most powerful nation-states, the UN completes its century-long rise to become a global government, removing individual nations' rights to declare their own laws or maintain a standing armed force.</p>
<p><b>2387</b><br />
The UN launches an initiative to vastly improve the Mars colonies. It is suspected that the population of Mars will reach a billion by 2400.</p>
<p><b>2402</b><br />
Disgruntled with the UN's socialist and anti-business policy-making, many of the solar system's top 50 companies join together to found the United Corporate Initiative.</p>
<p><b>2412</b><br />
With the UN's economic power waning, it is forced to enter talks with the UCI and agree a co-operative path ahead for humanity.</p>
<p><b>2477</b><br />
With colonial opinions slowly turning against Earth due to the UN's repeated Earth-first lawmaking, the UCI begins construction of a giant space station at Lagrange point L4.</p>
<p><b>2500</b><br />
As the new century dawns, the Free City is unveiled to the Solar System. Over the next twenty years, almost all of the UCI's member companies relocate to Free City.</p>
<p><b>2604</b><br />
After over a hundred years of mounting economic pressure, the UN becomes the last power to abandon its own financial system in favour of the Free City credit system.</p>
<p><b>2651</b><br />
Political tensions between the Martian Republic and the UN come to a head, and war is declared. With the bias- and conscience-free UCI selling arms and information to both sides, the war is to last nearly a decade.</p>
<p><b>2659</b><br />
Emerging the victors, the Martians set about rebuilding their damaged economy with generous help from the UCI. Faced with a ravaged planet and a failing ecosystem, the remnants of the UN take out a huge loan from the UCI to enable the majority of Earth's population to evacuate and begin new lives on the Lunar colonies. Crippled by debt, they never truly recover.</p>
<p><b>2718</b><br />
The Europa colony disappears, along with the moon Europa itself, in a mysterious incident that claims the lives of all 32000 scientists and engineers working there. Despite a news blackout, rumours swirl and unrest grows until those responsible are named and imprisoned. The precise cause is never made public.</p>
<p><b>2836</b><br />
High on the wealth of the Solar System's increasingly exploited resources, the UCI establishes the Explorer Federation, an initiative to depart the Solar System in search of new pastures to colonise.</p>
<p><b>2891</b><br />
The Celestial Fleet, EFS Sun Dancer, Star Valkyrie and Moon Seraph, leave Free City, their inhabitants becoming the first extrasolar travelers on an 8-light-year journey to a habitable exoplanet.</p>
