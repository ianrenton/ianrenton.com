The photo below shows my current "shack" setup. The left-hand monitor here is displaying my aircraft, ship and APRS tracker called ["Plane/Sailing"](/hardware/planesailing), while the right is showing a prototype of an 80s-style interface for WSPRnet.

Under the monitors from left-to-right are a Yaesu FT-840 HF transciever, MFJ 949C antenna tuner, Nevada PS23SWI power supply, Yaesu FT-7800 dual-band FM radio, and the box that contains the Plane/Sailing hardware. Largely invisible in the tangle of wires in the background are my two handhelds, a Yaesu FT-60 and a Baofeng UV-82.

Outside, the largest antenna at the top is a Diamond X-50 antenna for 2m-70cm, which is split between my SDRs and my transciever using an MFJ-1708B-SDR splitter that prevents power going into the RTL-SDR when transmitting through the mobile radio. In the middle, between that and the TV antenna, is a Pimoroni 1090MHz antenna for ADS-B.

Not pictured is my LW-10-DX antenna for HF.
