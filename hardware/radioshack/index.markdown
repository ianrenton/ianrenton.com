The photo below shows my current "shack" setup. The left-hand monitor here is displaying ["Plane/Sailing"](/hardware/planesailing), while the right is showing a spectrum across the 70cm band in SDRSharp.

Under the monitor stand from left-to-right are a Nevada PS23SWI power supply, Yaesu FT-7800 dual-band FM radio, two Raspberry Pis with RTL-SDR v3 dongles, a HackRF One with Portapack, and the obligatory Baofeng handheld.

Outside, the largest antenna at the top is a Diamond X-50 antenna for 2m-70cm, which is split between my SDRs and my transciever using an MFJ-1708B-SDR splitter that prevents power going into the RTL-SDR when transmitting through the mobile radio. In the middle, between that and the TV antenna, is a Pimoroni 1090MHz antenna for ADS-B.

When time and money allows, I'm hoping to extend this equipment with an HF rig for DXing on SSB voice and digital modes such as FT8, and a suitable antenna such as a horizontal dipole down the length of the garden.
