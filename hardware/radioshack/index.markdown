The photo below shows my current "shack" setup, set up for FT-8. On the left monitor is WSJT-X and N1MM+, and on the right monitor is GridTracker.

To the left of the monitors are my Yaesu FT-840 HF transceiver, MFJ 949C antenna tuner, and Signalink USB sound card. Underneath the left monitor is my Nevada PS23SWI power supply and Yaesu FT-7800 VHF/UHF transceiver. Largely invisible in the background are my two handhelds, a Yaesu FT-60 and a Baofeng UV-82, and the Plane/Sailing hardware.

Outside, the largest antenna at the top is a Diamond X-50 antenna for 2m-70cm, which is split between my SDRs and my transciever using an MFJ-1708B-SDR splitter that prevents power going into the RTL-SDR when transmitting through the mobile radio. In the middle, between that and the TV antenna, is a Pimoroni 1090MHz antenna for ADS-B. By the back of the TV antenna, with wire going off to the left, is my LW-10-DX antenna for HF.
