USV-01 "Harry Paye" is based on the [HobbyKing "Scott Free" Offshore Racing](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=81594) remote control boat.

The hull comes relatively complete, with ESC and motors mounted internally, dedicated slots for the batteries, and all the through-hull components in place. The interior is not particularly spacious, but should be enough for our purposes.

The stern of the vessel is only missing the propeller and rudder assembly:

The prop is simply attached with a 7mm spanner, or in my case a big adjustable wrench, although care needs to be taken when gripping the prop to tighten it.

A couple of bolts attach the rudder assembly behind it:

The rudder is then connected to the servo with a wire, and the water cooling intake connected to the rudder assembly.

The hull is now ready for connecting the batteries and receiver.
