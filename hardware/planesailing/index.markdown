"Plane/Sailing" is the name given to my home aircraft and ship tracker. It receives ADS-B and AIS signals via antennas on my house, processes them to share with popular tracking websites, and displays the combined results on a website for the world to see.

If you’d like to see what I’m currently tracking, check out <a href="https://planesailing.ianrenton.com">https://planesailing.ianrenton.com</a>!

The links below are to the design & build information in case you are interested or would like to build a similar setup for yourself! All the software is open source, and all the hardware chosen to be as inexpensive as possible.
