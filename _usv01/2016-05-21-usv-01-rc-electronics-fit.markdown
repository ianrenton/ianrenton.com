With the [propulsion hardware fitted](../usv-01-hull-assembly), it's time to fit a set of electronics to enable remote control of the vehicle.

The batteries in general are difficult to fit. In particular, on the port side the battery access is blocked by the ESC. The port battery must therefore be pushed forward on the starboard side, then brought around the front of the motor. This is not especially easy either.

The starboard battery can then be fitted too, and velco straps&mdash;again with some difficulty&mdash;used to hold them in place.

The RC receiver is attached to the throttle ESC and rudder servo by the trailing servo leads.

The schematic for the installed electronics now looks like this (click for PDF):

The boat is now ready to be tested on the water&mdash;initially, in the bath.

Here's a video of the first out-of-water and in-water propulsion tests:
