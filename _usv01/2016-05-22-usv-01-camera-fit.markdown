For test purposes, a GoPro clone was fitted. Because we may want to remove this in future, for example to fit a Raspberry Pi camera instead, a mounting bracket was fixed to the hull using strong adhesive tape rather than a through-hull screw mount.

The camera is then affixed to this when in use. The camera was fitted quite far forward in order to maintain a good centre of gravity. In testing, these boats tend to pitch up significantly when travelling at speed, so keeping the centre of gravity as far forward as possible will help keep the boat stable.

The USV now looks rather top-heavy, although the camera is light for its size, and the majority of the boat's mass still belongs to the batteries and motor that sit on or below the water line.
