Moving House Checklist
----------------------

I discovered this list of "things to remember when moving house" languishing unpublished, so I figured I'd strip out any personal information (seeing as it used to contain my address and a list of all my credit cards, etc...) and publish it just in case it's useful to anyone.

  * **Addresses** - write down new address (I may have forgotten the postcode several times in the past...)
  * **Route** - work out the best way of getting from old to new
  * **Solicitors** - organise, pay
  * **Mortgage**
  * **Completion, Key Exchange**
  * **Removal van**

  * **Landline Phone** - can take up to 2 weeks and Â£125 to connect a new BT line if there isn't already one active
  * **Internet** - advise them in advance, but can't move you until 24 hours after BT switch you over, may still take up to 2 weeks to start working
  * **Mobile Phones**
  * **Electricity** - Call a month in advance to warn, then send them final / first readings for old/new houses
