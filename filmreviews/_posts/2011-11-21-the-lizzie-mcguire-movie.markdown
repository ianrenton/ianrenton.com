Fun fact of the day: The guy who plays the hotel receptionist also plays Dr Zarkov in the Flash Gordon TV series.

Fun fact of the year: There was a Flash Gordon TV series.  It looks FUCKING AWFUL.  The Pirate Bay has [all 21 episodes](http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4242415/Flash_Gordon_Season_S1E1-21_Full) - plus an ["Episode 22", only in Spanish](http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4729851/Flash_Gordon_1x22_DVB_Spanish_Final), which [IMDB doesn't believe exists](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0959086/episodes).  **LET'S.  DO.  THIS.**
