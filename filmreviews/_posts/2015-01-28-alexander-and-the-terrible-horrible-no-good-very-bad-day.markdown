## Synopsis

ALEXANDER, a GENERIC DISNEY MOVIE KID, lives with this GENERIC DISNEY MOVIE FAMILY in GENERIC DISNEY MOVIE SUBURBIA. Everything is going OK until ALEXANDER curses them to an ETERNITY OF TORMENT where they begin to FAIL at EVER MORE BASIC TASKS until they are reduced to GIBBERING, INSANE SHADOWS OF THEIR FORMER SELVES.

Well that's what I'm hoping for in the Director's Cut, anyway.

## By the Numbers
