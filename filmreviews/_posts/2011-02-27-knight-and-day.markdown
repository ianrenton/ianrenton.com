## Synopsis

PEOPLE FROM THE FBI describe TOM CRUISE as a dangerous, deluded, crazy individual.  Which, you know, SEEMS PRETTY REASONABLE TO ME.

Oh, some RANDOM ACTION-MOVIE PLOT involving a SUPER SECRET PERPETUAL ENERGY SOURCE, GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACIES, ARMS DEALERS, CRAZY RUSSIANS and so on.  Might as well be XENU to be honest.

## By the Numbers

  * Tom Cruise: 1
  * Everyone else on the plane: 0
  * People that care that June was on the crashed flight: 2
  * People that care that June denies there being a crash: 0
  * People that care that Tom Cruise is car-surfing: 0
  * Methods of transport used: 7
  * Tom Cruise creepiness: 1533
  * Minutes June is capable of being angry for: 2
  * Minutes June is capable of being competent for: 3
  * Missiles fired by super secret bizzarro-plane: 12
  * Warhead size of each missile: negligible
