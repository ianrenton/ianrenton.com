## Synopsis:

A WEIRD FISH-THING escapes from a WEIRD HUMAN-THING, comes ashore and falls in love with an ACTUAL HUMAN.  WEIRD FISH-THING is then re-captured by WEIRD HUMAN-THING, but escapes, and returns to reclaim her love by LAYING WASTE TO HALF A CITY and AN ENTIRE SHIPPING FLEET with a GIANT ALL-CONQUERING FISH TSUNAMI, then alters EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD to DESTROY THE WORLD by crashing the MOON into it.

So basically she's FRIEZA, but also a FISH that's in LOVE with a FIVE-YEAR-OLD.

Oh, MIYAZAKI.
