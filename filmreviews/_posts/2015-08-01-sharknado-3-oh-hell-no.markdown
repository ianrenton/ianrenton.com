## Synopsis

A "TOTALLY UNEXPECTED" SHARKNADO ravages the EXACT STRETCH OF THE COUNTRY between where IAN ZIERING is and where TARA REID is. COINCIDENCE... OR CONSPIRACY?!

Anywhay, they team up with MAD MAXINE and THE HOFF and consume the UNHOLY POWER OF JEDWARD to battle SHARKS with INCREASINGLY ODD VARIANTS OF CHAINSAWS. This would have been enough for such *traditional*, *mundane* films as "Sharknado 2".

So now of course there is also a SPACE SHUTTLE and SPACE JETPACKS and SPACE LASERS and LASER CHAINSAWS because APPARENTLY WE JUST ACCEPT THIS SHIT NOW.
