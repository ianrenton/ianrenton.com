## Synopsis

SHARPE and a GINGER DUDE are secretly GREEK GODS, come to EARTH to bitch about someone stealing a LIGHTNING BOLT.  Meanwhile, JAMES BOND has really let himself go, and now sports a BEARD, a WHEELCHAIR and A HORSE'S ARSE.  PERCY JACKSON, a FAIL in human form, discovers he's the SON of GINGER DUDE, goes away to GIANT EGO CAMP to learn how to prove his INNOCENCE by BEATING THE SHIT OUT OF PEOPLE and falling in love with the BITCHIEST PERSON AT CAMP.

The BITCH then becomes kinda' WHINY as they gallivant all over America looking for three conveniently-located PEARLS, guarded by TRINITY, the PARKS AND RECREATION AUTHORITY, and CAKES made of LSD and LADY GAGA.

Then they visit the FINAL LEVEL, defeat the FIRST END-BOSS, recover the DEUS EX MACHINA, unleash the MAIN CHARACTER'S PREVIOUSLY-SEALED SUPERFLANGE to defeat the SECOND END-BOSS, return the DEUS EX MACHINA to SHARPE, resolve the MAIN CHARACTER'S OUTSTANDING DADDY ISSUES, and win the GAME.

Incidentally, these kids look about twelve, how come they can drive and are allowed into casinos?
