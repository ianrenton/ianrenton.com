> A guest review by Ian‭ “‬Devo‭” ‬Montgomery

## Synopsis

PAUL W.S.‭ ‬ANDERSON’S WIFE stars in PAUL W.S.‭ ‬ANDERSON’S slightly-more-faithful adaptation of the POPULAR VIDEO GAME SEQUEL.

In response to a MAN-MADE PLAGUE leaking out in their underground lab from the first film,‭ ‬the Umbrella Corporation think it's a good idea to RE-OPEN THE DOORS and see what happened down there.‭ ‬Naturally,‭ ‬ALL THE ZOMBIES HAPPEN and an entire city goes to hell.‭ ‬COPS,‭ ‬COMMANDOS and PAUL W.S.‭ ‬ANDERSON'S WIFE‭ (‬oh myyy‭!) ‬fight against the undead hordes whilst looking for a lost child while being chased by a mutant super-soldier.
