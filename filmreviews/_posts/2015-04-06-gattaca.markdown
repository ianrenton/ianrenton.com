## Synopsis

It's the vaguely not too distant, Esperanto speaking FUTURE, where a GENETIC CASTE SYSTEM dashes the hopes of the WEAK. Hopelessly romantic IMPOSTER-ONAUT who looks like EDWARD SNOWDEN if you have HIS EYESIGHT is nearly framed by his OWN EYELASH for murder, but gets away with RISKING HIS BROTHER'S LIFE because HONOUR.
