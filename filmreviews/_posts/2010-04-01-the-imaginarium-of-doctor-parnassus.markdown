## Synopsis

DOCTOR PARNASSUS runs a TRAVELLING MAGIC SHOW with his daughter, a CUTE REDHEAD, a NOT-A-MIDGET and an OVERUSER OF THE WORD 'MATE'.  DOCTOR PARNASSUS uses his SUPER PSYCHIC POWERS to suck people through a mirror and into a strange WORLD INSIDE THEIR HEAD where they have to make a choice between their SOUL going to him or to THE DEVIL.  Or something.  Either way, TERRY GILLIAM rapes your BRAIN.
