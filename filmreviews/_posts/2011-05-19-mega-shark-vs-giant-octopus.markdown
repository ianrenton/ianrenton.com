### Synopsis

A MILITARY SONAR TEST unexpectedly unleashes the CHEESIEST FILM IN HISTORY.

### By the Numbers

  * Whale meat closeups, in kilotons: 27
  * WHAT'S GOING ON: 1
  * Bottles of J2O drunk out of paper bags: 2
  * Shark jump height, in metres: 5000

  * Screw it, [all of this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1350498/goofs). I'm going to stop commenting on the tech before I explode.  This film was clearly not written by anyone who has ever been on a ship, a submarine, or possibly even seen the sea.
