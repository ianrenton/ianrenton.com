> A guest review by Danfox Davies. He took one for the team.

## Synopsis

It's the DIFFICULT SECOND FILM in a sugar-powered e-number engine's progress to HASBRO'S DOMINATION of not only EQUESTRIA, which it handily BOUGHT, but also EARTH, which it's clearly still working on.

Three BITCHES try to hijack the magical powers of a FICTIONAL REALM to their own NEFARIOUS ENDS in THIS REALM. And inevitably, a MORAL about ENEMIES being given ANOTHER CHANCE once they've been DE-EVILLED. Because *have a heart, you bastards*.
