<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Ilandra and Cain rose late and breakfasted substantially, all the<br />
better to put off their inevitable encounter with Duchess Regara Poppy.</p>
<p>"I suppose", said Cain between slices of toast, "that we shouldn&#039;t <i>really</i> be worried.  I mean, she&#039;ll be happy, right?  Just... happy in her unique and explosive way.  It can&#039;t go <i>too</i> badly."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Do you reckon it&#039;s worth dropping by an armoury and requisitioning<br />
some armour?" Ilandra asked, looking contemplatively into her mug of<br />
cream.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, you know, it might... give the wrong impression."</p>
<p>Cain thought for a minute, considering his mother&#039;s range of possible responses.</p>
<p>"No, you&#039;re right.  Armour it is.  Possibly also shields, some kind of magical protection, and earplugs."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra drained her cup and stood.<br />
"I don&#039;t know if I have any armour... but I&#039;m fairly sure I have a<br />
shield somewhere... Magical protection might be a little tricky and as<br />
for ear plugs, well, I think we might have some of those as well..."<br />
she said, walking towards the door.</p>
<p>She wandered down the corridor and entered a room with an unassuming<br />
door, emerging a few minutes later wearing a suit of chain mail and<br />
dragging a 6 foot shield behind her.</p>
<p>"This is pretty much all the stuff that&#039;s not rotten or broken..." she<br />
told him, looking slightly guilty. "There didn&#039;t seem much point in<br />
taking care of the armour so... it&#039;s not in very good condition..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Um," said Cain.  "Um."</p>
<p>It took a good fifteen seconds or so for him to recover his composure.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said.  "I&#039;m sure that&#039;ll duly protect us, if not exactly<br />
give the right impression.  Shall we be going, then?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Yeah, might as well..." she said, picking the shield up and carrying<br />
it out the room having to make several attempts to get it through the<br />
door. Once through she looked back sheepishly, as if to admit that<br />
she&#039;d almost forgotten about the shield in her hand as she tried to go<br />
through the door. "Shall I walk beside Hawthorn? The armour and shield<br />
might be too much to carry as well as the two of us..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Hawthorn?" asked Cain?  "You have <i>seen</i> him, right?  Somehow, I think he&#039;ll manage."</p>
<p>Ilandra and Cain walked out to the stables, passing hastily through<br />
them at Ilandra&#039;s request in case of any terrifying non-Hawthorn<br />
examples of the species, and before long reached Cain&#039;s horse.</p>
<p>Hawthorn turned to look at them, and snorted.  Cain made skin-to-skin contact, brushing his mane.</p>
<p>"So, since when did Honeysuckle stop being neutral?" asked the horse.</p>
<p>"They still are," said Cain with a sigh.  "We&#039;re going to see my mother."</p>
<p>Hawthorn snorted again.  "Ah.  Well, so long as she doesn&#039;t<br />
wear anything obviously white, you&#039;ll be okay.  That shield&#039;s<br />
coming with us?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Cain.</p>
<p>"Well, we&#039;ll have to have somewhere to hang it.  You might want to<br />
go and stand with her, she&#039;s probably not going to like this."</p>
<p>Cain walked back to Ilandra, and gripped her shoulder tightly.<br />
"You might want to brace yourself for this bit, if you don&#039;t like<br />
horses."</p>
<p>Hawthorn lowered his head, then with a loud neigh reared up as high as<br />
the stable roof would allow.  As he did so, a unicorn-horned<br />
helmet of gold and brass materialised in bands and plates about his<br />
head, before stretching down into a single gold plate that covered his<br />
chest, then back in gold and silver bands all along his body.<br />
They clanked into place with a solid thump, each inch-thick armour<br />
plate slotting neatly into its neighbours.  His saddle also<br />
transformed from a flimsy leather affair into a hefty metallic harness,<br />
complete with - as originally intended - a shield-hook.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>After a few seconds of stunned silence, Ilandra grinned and excitedly<br />
babbled. "THAT WAS AMAZING! Can any other horses do it or is it just<br />
Hawthorn? Ooooh, Hawthorn... does it hurt to put armour on?"</p>
<p>She ran up to the horse and hooked the shield on to the armour, taking an extra minute or so to look the armour over.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"You&#039;ve not seen a battle up close, have you?" asked Cain.  "The<br />
armour varies a bit from horse to horse, but plenty of them can do<br />
it.  The officers of heavy cavalry regiments tend to have horses<br />
with that kind of glamour."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Oh." Ilandra said, looking slightly embarrassed. "Fair enough.... so shall we get moving?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Before long, thanks to House Honeysuckle&#039;s still unnerving ability to<br />
be just where it wanted to be, Ilandra and Cain arrived at Castle<br />
Poppy.  They received sharp salutes as they entered through the<br />
main gates, but the sounds of the guards&#039; whispered confusion were not<br />
far behind.  A scuttling sound heading around inside the walls<br />
suggested that one of the guards may have gone to check with his<br />
superiors whether or not they were at war again.</p>
<p>Hawthorn clanked his way into the stables and, as Ilandra lifted the<br />
shield from him, his armour evaporated into the air as if it had been<br />
no more solid than the morning mist.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Right, you stay behind me and I&#039;ll keep the shield up so that any<br />
damage is minimal..." she told Cain, leading the way into the castle.<br />
"mostly because I&#039;m more protected than you..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Together Ilandra and Cain snuck up to the throne room, dodging the confused looks of servants on the way.</p>
<p>The guards outside the heavy double doors of the throne room looked<br />
like they&#039;d cause trouble for a moment, but a brief flicker of Cain&#039;s<br />
eyes conveyed perfectly that it would be best for them to stay<br />
quiet.  And so with little commotion Ilandra, dressed head to toe<br />
in armour and with shield before her, pushed open the doors and came<br />
into the presence of the Duchess.</p>
<p>"Guards!" shouted Regara as she stood in indignant rage.  "Gua- wait."  Double-take.  "Wait, what?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra cautiously poked her head around the side of the shield. Taking a deep breath she blurted out<br />
"We have a date for you... it&#039;s next Wednesday"<br />
before ducking her head back behind the shield where she tried to hide her fear.</p>
<p><i>Please don&#039;t kill me... please don&#039;t kill me... oh god, speaking to the rose dukes was easier than this...</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Wednesday?  A d-"  Regara&#039;s eyes virtually boggled.<br />
"What, for the wedding?  Bloody hell.  Well, that&#039;s one less<br />
thing to nag you about."</p>
<p>The Duchess sagged back into her chair, her day&#039;s supply of energy having depleted.  "Now, second question.  Armour?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"It may have been suggested that you were likely to kill us for doing<br />
this to you..." Ilandra said, stepping slightly to the side. "After<br />
all, I completely forgot to bring any chocolate..."</p>
