<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>For Ilandra, Nyano and their fellow travellers, the afternoon passed<br />
mostly in quietness.  For a while a light drizzle descended,<br />
overlaying the hush with a kind of understated irritation.</p>
<p>It cleared up before dusk, and as the light began to drain from the<br />
clearing sky, the main group came across their scout sitting in a<br />
clearing by the side of the track idly sharpening twigs with a knife.</p>
<p>"Here will do for tonight," he said, his eyes scanning the rest of the<br />
group as if daring them to disagree.  "Pitch the tents while it&#039;s<br />
still light.  I&#039;ll take one of you with me to gather firewood."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked across at the little raccoon then at Cain. By her<br />
reasoning, it&#039;d be unfair to expect the raccoon to want to be<br />
collecting firewood with all that had happened and besides, she really<br />
wanted to know more about the shiny eyes.</p>
<p>"I&#039;ll go with you, unless anyone else want to...?" she said, standing<br />
up. She looked at Cain. "Take care of Nyano, he doesn&#039;t look like his<br />
normal happy self..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Being back on the road and in the familiar environment of a night time<br />
camp, Nyano found himself slipping back into his old habits.</p>
<p>Without much ado, he looked up at Caine and said.</p>
<p>"I&#039;ll just have a quick scout around the perimiter, you never know what&#039;s out there."</p>
<p>Then he slinked off into the trees.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As Jebodiah and the young warrior prepared the camp, the former showing<br />
almost sprightly enthusiasm despite his age.  At one side of the<br />
clearing Ilandra followed the other man out into the darkness, whilst<br />
at the other Nyano scampered off into the undergrowth, leaving Cain<br />
looking about the place and fretting that he was completely unsuited to<br />
follow him.</p>
<p>They spread out, their eyes gradually adjusting to the increasing<br />
darkness.  By the time the groups were both thinking of returning<br />
to camp for the night, it was nearly pitch black and beginning to get<br />
cold.</p>
<p><font color="red">Rolling Perception 4 + Alertness 3 for Nyano, difficulty 7: 1 success</font></p>
<p>Just as the raccoon was turning to head back he thought he heard a twig<br />
snap, deep in the forest.  Not that there was anything unusual<br />
about that; animals frequently stepped on fallen twigs.  But very<br />
rarely was such a sound followed by a harsh "Ssssh!"...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>At the sound of a voice, Nyano dived carefully into a nearby bush and grabbed his boomerang.</p>
<p>Feeling comforted by its reassuring weight in his hands, he started to creep towards the noise he heard.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p><font color="red">Nyano rolls Dex + Stealth, difficulty 6.  2 successes!</font></p>
<p>Nyano edged slowly and quietly through the bushes, his small size<br />
helping him pass by obstacles any larger creature would have had to<br />
brush through.</p>
<p>The voices ahead continued in a harsh whisper.  Clearly their<br />
owners had a different idea of stealth from the soldiers Nyano was used<br />
to.</p>
<p>"Shut up!" hissed one of them.  "Someone&#039;ll hear you, shushing like that!"</p>
<p>"Speak for yourself!  Besides, there&#039;s no-one out there!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but you can never be too sure!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>With little more than a whisper of sound Nyano climbed up a nearby tree so that he could get a better view of the interlopers.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>In the distance, shadows tried unsuccessfully to stay still and<br />
silent.  It was hard to tell in the dark quite how many of them<br />
there were, but at least three had spoken and the shadows suggested<br />
perhaps twice that number.  For the moment, while they argued and<br />
hushed each other, it didn&#039;t look like they were going anywhere.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Having worked out roughly how many there are, it hadn&#039;t taken Nyano a<br />
long time to realise that making a loud noise would have been a really<br />
bad idea.</p>
<p>Instead, he scampered back down the tree and went in search of Caine. It didn&#039;t take him long to locate the errant prince.</p>
<p>He tugged on the edge of Caine&#039;s and whispered quietly.</p>
<p>"There&#039;s a squad of about 10 people out there. I don&#039;t think they&#039;re proper soldiers, they sound kinda stupid."</p>
<p>[<font>Private to GM: I<br />
couldn&#039;t mkae out from previous posts whether or not Caine went into<br />
the woods. I&#039;m writing this on the assumption he didn&#039;t, since that&#039;s<br />
the optimum result for me. Please edit it with sufficient spot checks<br />
if he&#039;s actually sneaking about somewhere.</font>]</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Oh," said Cain.  "Gosh.  Er, even if they&#039;re not proper<br />
soldiers, that&#039;s probably bad news.  Do you think they were<br />
following us?"</p>
<p>Just then, the foliage on the other side of the clearing parted as<br />
Ilandra and the burly man pushed though them, each carrying armfuls of<br />
sticks and branches.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looked up at him.</p>
<p>"Well whoever they are, they&#039;re clearly not going to be able to hurt <i>you</i>.  Would you mind going and asking them what they want?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p><font color="red">Nyano rolls Cha + nothing much, difficulty 6.  5 successes.  Raccoon SMASH!</font></p>
<p>"I, er...  You&#039;re probably right.  I should be... taking<br />
charge of the situation!  Yes.  Right," he said, heading<br />
toward the forest with temporary cute-induced vigour.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"What&#039;s going on? Hold on! Wait for me!!!" Ilandra raced after Cain.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano just catches up with Illandra as she runs off, and tries his best cute expression.</p>
<p>"He&#039;s going to check on some people in the woods. You probably don&#039;t want to go after him"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"But... if he gets hurt..." she shook her head as to shake away the<br />
sadness. "I can&#039;t let him get hurt... he&#039;s all I have. Let&#039;s at least<br />
follow him to make sure he&#039;s ok."</p>
<p>She carried on after him, only this time in cat form.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Looking a little startled at the sudden cat, Nyano bounds after the pair of them.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Full of confidence and sure in his own abilities, Cain stalked out into<br />
the forest.  Bushes were struck aside and twigs trampled<br />
underfoot, easily drowning out the noise that would&#039;ve been made by the<br />
intruders if they hadn&#039;t gone suddenly very quiet.  In fact,<br />
heading out blindly into the night, Cain was in danger of walking right<br />
into them...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Still trailed by his two furry companions, Cain walked directly up to<br />
where Nyano had pointed out that the interlopers had been.  They<br />
were silent now, all but invisible shadows barely visible amongst<br />
bushes and trees, though Cain must have seen something.  He<br />
stopped just short of the nearest shadow, figuring that walking into<br />
their midst would be a bad idea, stood up to his full height, and<br />
glared out into the darkness.</p>
<p>"Who goes there?" he asked into the night, almost timidly.</p>
<p>There was no reply.</p>
<p>"No," he thought to himself.  "Must take charge of the situation.  Right."</p>
<p>"My name is Cain, Crown Prince of House Poppy!" he almost bellowed.  "You will identify yourselves!"</p>
<p><font color="red">Cain rolls Charisma (4) + Leadership (3), difficulty 8.  1 success!</font></p>
<p>Shadows stirred nervously in the darkness.</p>
<p>"Er...  Sarge?" said one of them.  "Shouldn&#039;t we..."</p>
<p>"No, you dolt!" came the reply.  "Shut up and stay still!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Behind Cain, a little cat-shaped mass was face-palming.<br />
<i>I guess I&#039;d better help out...</i></p>
<p>She moved to just behind one of the men and morphed back to her fae form, gripping his throat in her hand.<br />
She whispered in his ear in a very sing-song way.</p>
<p>"You might just want to identify yourself, you know? Cos I&#039;d hate for anything to happen to you..."</p>
<p>Then she chuckled quietly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The sergeant stiffened in Ilandra&#039;s grasp.  <font color="red">(There must be a euphemism in there somewhere.)</font></p>
<p>"Er... lads?" he choked.  "Gotta bit of a problem &#039;ere..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>A thought bubbled up in Ilandra&#039;s head.<br />
<i> I&#039;m completely outnumbered aren&#039;t I? Damn.</i></p>
<p>"Now lads, I would just identify myself if I were you and then I&#039;ll let<br />
go of the nice man..." she said, sweetly. "After all, it&#039;s a bit rude<br />
not to introduce yourself when meeting new people... and he&#039;s already<br />
introduced himself."</p>
<p>An afterthought wormed it&#039;s way in.</p>
<p>"I also wouldn&#039;t try anything stupid, I have this man&#039;s throat."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"We&#039;re...  We&#039;re no-one, really," piped up one of the other men.</p>
<p>"Leastways, we were not so long ago," said still another.  The sergeant deflated.  "&#039;Afore the war..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra let go of their sergeant like she&#039;d promised and melted back<br />
into her cat form, retreating to the relative safety of a nearby tree<br />
in order to allow Cain to do whatever he was planning.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Right then," said Cain, avoiding looking at Ilandra.  "And who are you now?"</p>
<p>"We&#039;re soldiers," said a young and sad voice.</p>
<p>"With which army?"</p>
<p>"Hy-" began the young voice, before the sergeant cut in.</p>
<p>"We ain&#039;t, anymore.  We don&#039;t fight for no-one.  We&#039;re deserters, right?" he said, glaring at Cain.</p>
<p>"We&#039;s &#039;ad &#039;nuf," another one said.  "We din&#039; soign up f&#039; this shi&#039;<br />
- &#039;ell, we din&#039; soign up! - an&#039; now e&#039;rythin&#039;s gone ta&#039; hell, we&#039;s<br />
goin&#039; &#039;ome &#039;gain."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"And your home is...?" asked Cain.</p>
<p>"South," said one of the men.  "South, &#039;most a&#039;far a&#039; ye can go &#039;afore it become But&#039;cup land."</p>
<p>Cain allowed himself to relax a little, knowing that - at least as far<br />
as he could trust that the soldiers were telling the truth - they<br />
weren&#039;t heading towards the castle as well.</p>
<p>"Now then," said Cain, "I think we&#039;re just about done.  One more<br />
thing - you&#039;ve come from the front lines, right?  Where&#039;s the<br />
fighting?  Who&#039;s winning?"</p>
<p>The sergeant&#039;s face turned from relieved to stony.</p>
<p>"Why should we tell you?  We&#039;ve &#039;ad enough&#039;a this war, and so&#039;a<br />
our mates.  We don&#039; need anyone like you keepin&#039; it goin&#039;."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Believe me, we&#039;re just as keen as you to get away from the<br />
fighting..." Ilandra said from her perch on a low branch. "He&#039;s just<br />
curious. Please tell us..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Oi don&#039; trust a noble when they say tha&#039; no more," said the sergeant.  "We bin&#039; burned too many toimes by all thi&#039;.</p>
<p>"We&#039;ll be on our way."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Oh come on! What&#039;s wrong with curiosity?" she moaned, jumping down<br />
from the branch and transforming back in mid-air. "Flowers alive! You&#039;d<br />
almost think he was demanding you pick up arms and fight for him... I<br />
promise you, and I swear this by the flowers blooming on my land, that<br />
I have no intention of joining the war. I don&#039;t like fighting anyway..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"You, roight.  An&#039; &#039;im?" he said, jerking his thumb in the direction of Cain.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Not if he wants to stay on my good side, he won&#039;t.. or at least I hope not..." she said, looking at Cain. "Will you dearest?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain looked from Ilandra to the sergeant, and sighed.</p>
<p>"Look, it doesn&#039;t matter," he said.  "It&#039;s not as if we&#039;re going<br />
wherever the front is, anyway.  We&#039;ll get going our way, you go<br />
yours.  And no more sneaking around near our camp."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra took a moment to process what Cain had just said before she did anything.</p>
<p>"Well, I&#039;m curious now..." she mumbled. "Are we already going back?"</p>
<p>She tried her best to hide the fear and sadness that was creeping in.</p>
<p><i> he&#039;s still thinking of going off to war. and then where will that leave me? or is he?</i></p>
<p>"Just one thing," she asked Cain before she moved anywhere. "You&#039;re not planning on going off to fight are you?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Of course I&#039;m not," Cain said once they had parted ways with the<br />
soldiers.  "We&#039;ve lost most of our army and spent two years in<br />
exile; our involvement with the war is pretty much over.  But the<br />
more we can find out about how it&#039;s going, well...  If the tide<br />
turned, the whites are still pretty close to Poppy land.  My<br />
mother would want as much notice as possible if we had to run again.</p>
<p>"No, like we told Jebodiah, we&#039;re going with him to the castle.  I<br />
trust that man about as well as...  Well, I don&#039;t trust him.<br />
But if we can use him to sort out the Hyacinth problem the easy way,<br />
it&#039;ll save a lot of unnecessary fighting."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"OK, sorry... I just... Well..." Ilandra wasn&#039;t enjoying being lost for<br />
words again. "I don&#039;t like war. But I will help you as much as I can...<br />
I don&#039;t know..."</p>
<p>She shook her head to dispel the confusion then grabbed his hand.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As they approached the clearing, the old scout who had joined them at<br />
Wheat Down dropped silently out of a tree behind them and followed them<br />
back.</p>
<p>"So," said Jebodiah to the nobles as they arrived back and stood before<br />
the fire that he was coaxing into life.  "What were all that<br />
&#039;bout, eh?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra shrugged.</p>
<p>"Just some deserters going home from the battle... they seemed pretty sick of fighting..." she said, nonchalantly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Oi&#039;m not suproised," said Jebodiah.  "&#039;S&#039;all bin goin&#039; on far too<br />
long, if ya ask me.  But then, you know &#039;at anyroad.  Where<br />
was they fram?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"down south just before you hit buttercup... apparently. They were reluctant to tell us anything else..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Oi&#039;m almost glad they ain&#039; talkin&#039; ta nobles, ta be honest.  Tho&#039;<br />
it sounds &#039;bit harsh in this comp&#039;ny.  Well, we bin through this<br />
before.  Mebbe things is different where you comes from, but in<br />
this kingdom i&#039;s &#039;bout time our class realise they don&#039; &#039;ave ta be<br />
ordered &#039;round."</p>
