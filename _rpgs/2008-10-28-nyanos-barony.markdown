<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Jebodiah&#039;s eyes, no longer golden but hazel-brown, looked older and more tired than they ever had.</p>
<p>"So," he said to the assembled nobles.  "Shall we talk?  Tho&#039;<br />
we&#039;re free&#039;a th&#039; Duke&#039;s incompetent rule, now we&#039;re subject ta<br />
yours.  How ya gonna reassure the ordinary folk that their lives<br />
are gonna be better?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Well I&#039;m going not going to murder people and make the castle disappear for a start!"</p>
<p>Nyano paced as he thought.</p>
<p>"The first thing I&#039;m going to do is ask duchess Regara for help, she&#039;s<br />
been doing this a long time, she knows how to look after people. Then I<br />
suppose I&#039;d better makes sure that everyone is fed. Actually, before I<br />
do that, I better find out what is actually going on.</p>
<p>Can you tell me?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Wha&#039;s goin&#039; on," said Jebodiah, "is tha&#039; the people&#039;a this country are<br />
fed up&#039;a th&#039;nobility pamperin&#039; themselves an&#039; neglectin&#039; th&#039; people who<br />
do all th&#039; work!  The general feelin&#039; is that th&#039; peasants could<br />
do th&#039; job better &#039;emselves.  So, if ye&#039;s gonna keep control&#039;a<br />
this place, you might wanna convince th&#039; people that not only&#039;a you<br />
better than the Hy&#039;cinths, you&#039;re better &#039;an <i>us</i>."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano finally begins to understand Jebodiah&#039;s issue. He narrows his eyes as he looks at the older man</p>
<p>"That shouldn&#039;t be too hard. Can you even read and write?</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Jebodiah&#039;s eyes narrowed to match.</p>
<p>"Yes Oi can.  An&#039; Oi&#039;d wager a fair sum Oi know more &#039;bout this lan&#039; an&#039; it&#039;s people than you.  Yer point bein&#039;?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Then if you can prove to me that you had good reason to kill that man,<br />
and you&#039;re willing to be a vassal of house poppy, then you can be one<br />
of my advisors."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"He wouldn&#039;a given up &#039;is &#039;ouse willin&#039;ly, an&#039; if Oi&#039;d taken it an&#039;<br />
left &#039;im alive, he&#039;d&#039;a killed &#039;imself anyway.  Man&#039;s a coward.</p>
<p>"&#039;Sides," continued Jebodiah, "&#039;is bad decisions&#039;a led ta the deaths of<br />
thousands&#039;a Hy&#039;cinth peasants.  No matter &#039;ow much ya&#039; might not<br />
loike it, people loike revenge.  Leavin&#039; &#039;im &#039;live would&#039;a made me<br />
look weak, loike Oi didn&#039; rep&#039;sent the will&#039;a th&#039; people."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"So now he&#039;s dead you don&#039;t need to worry about representing the<br />
people..." Ilandra said, sitting up. "What happened with your eyes?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano watches Jebodiah carefully, waiting for his answer.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Tha&#039;s not it at all," said Jebodiah.  "Oi still care &#039;bout the<br />
people, more&#039;n any Hy&#039;cinth noble e&#039;er did.  Oi still rep&#039;sent th&#039;<br />
will&#039;a th&#039; people as best Oi can.</p>
<p>"My eyes?  Th&#039; curse were lifted.  That were me other reason<br />
fer seein&#039; off th&#039; Duke, but it ain&#039;t one anyone else cares &#039;bout."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"So THAT&#039;S what that thread was..." she mused. "That explains a lot..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"I care about the people too. I don&#039;t want anybody to be unhappy and<br />
for things to be badly governed. If Duke Hyacinth was so bad, that he<br />
made the peasants think they could do a better job by themselves then<br />
you probably just did a very brave thing."</p>
<p>Nyano looks deep into Jebodiah&#039;s eyes.</p>
<p>"But I didn&#039;t like the way you did it. You didn&#039;t challenge him or tell<br />
him what he&#039;d done wrong, you just murdered him. That&#039;s why I&#039;m glad<br />
you&#039;re not in charge. You&#039;re right, I don&#039;t know anything about this<br />
barony, but I&#039;m going to learn, and I&#039;m not going to murder anyone. If<br />
you really care for these people, you should agree to help me."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"He knew wha&#039; &#039;e&#039;d done wrong.  Oi&#039;d told &#039;im &#039;afore, not so ver&#039; long ago, the day &#039;e gave me them eyes.</p>
<p>"Now, I din&#039; say I wouldn&#039;t help ya&#039;.  &#039;avin&#039; me aroun&#039; is the<br />
only way you&#039;s gonna &#039;ave the respect o&#039; the people, and &#039;avin&#039; you<br />
aroun&#039; is the only way oi&#039;s gonna get the respect o&#039; anyone else.</p>
<p>"You an&#039; Oi, we think diff&#039;ly and we do thin&#039;s diff&#039;ly.  But<br />
t&#039;gether, we moight jus&#039; &#039;ave a chance&#039;a gettin&#039; this ta work."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Well I&#039;m glad we&#039;ve got that worked out." Nyano says to Jebodiah.</p>
<p>He turns to his father. "Dad, did you think I&#039;m doing everything ok?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I don&#039;t. I think we ought to give Jebodiah elocution lessons otherwise<br />
the others will just laugh the two of you out of anywhere..." she said.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"We do? I thought it would just show that I listen to my peasants. I<br />
thought I was the one who&#039;s going to be talking to anyone important.<br />
Besides, I don&#039;t think he&#039;ll want elocution lessons, the other peasants<br />
will think he&#039;s silly."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Other nobles think me talking normally instead of like hyacinth did is<br />
too close to my people..." Ilandra pointed out. "Nobles are weird<br />
creatures that don&#039;t always think peasants are people too..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Well if they don&#039;t like how I talk, then they can go and answer to<br />
Duchess Regara. I bet she won&#039;t be happy if they go and bother her with<br />
rubbish like that!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra buried her face in her hands.</p>
<p>"Oh gods, I&#039;d completely forgotten about Regara..." she moaned. She<br />
looked up at Nyano, "You know, nobody&#039;s dumb enough to annoy her so it<br />
looks like all your problems are more or less sorted really."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Regara, now tha&#039;d be Duchess Poppy, roight?  Mister... Nyano,<br />
were it?  Oi think we should probably &#039;ave a word wi&#039; &#039;er.</p>
<p>"&#039;Landra, Cain?  Tho&#039; it din&#039;t turn out quoite wha&#039; Oi had in<br />
moind, Oi thank ye fer comin&#039; this far wi&#039; me.  Wha&#039;ll ye be doin&#039;<br />
wi&#039; yerselves now?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Might as well come with you to face the music..." Ilandra said.<br />
"...unless we could trust all of you not to let her know we were here."</p>
<p>She looked around.</p>
<p>"Probably not. OK, well we&#039;ll go with you to see her." she finished.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"We better go and see her then..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m not sure that will tax you too much," said Regara.</p>
<p>Those stood around the table turned to see Regara, flanked by a Captain<br />
and a Sergeant of the Poppy army, standing in the centre of the<br />
room.  From the surprised looks on the formerly-Hyacinth guards&#039;<br />
faces, it was clear that they had not used the door.</p>
<p>The soldiers, noting the presence of Cain, Serendil and Nyano, saluted.</p>
<p>"Cain, Cain, Cain," said the Duchess with a sigh.  "What have you-"</p>
<p>She paused, having sensed the residual glamour in the air.</p>
<p>"Wait, not Cain, Nyano.  Nyano?!"  Her eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
<p>"I think you&#039;d all better start explaining what went on here.  But first, get me a chair!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra hoped she hadn&#039;t been noticed, melted quietly into cat form and<br />
ran up Cain&#039;s trouser leg into his coat pocket where she hid.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Without thinking Nyano headed right over to a big chair in the corner<br />
of the room. After a couple of seconds of pulling and pushing he<br />
realised this wasn&#039;t going to work.</p>
<p>Luckily, some of the others took pity on him, and the room was rapidly arranged so that Regara could sit.</p>
<p>The easy task having been performed, Nyano began the hard part:<br />
explaining himself. He marched out in front of the improvised throne<br />
and began to speak.</p>
<p>"I only came here looking for my father, it was a quest you see, and<br />
then I met Caine and his friend, and they were with that guy."</p>
<p>He pauses to point at Jebodiah.</p>
<p>"Who&#039;s called Jebodiah I think. Anyway I knew that dad was in here<br />
somewhere, so we came here. I think Jebodiah wanted to come here as<br />
well, and he had those friends, who were kinda handy."</p>
<p>He sweeps a paw across An Hero and company. Magnanimously including them in the proceedings.</p>
<p>"When we got here, there were some armies outside and it was raining<br />
rocks, so I figured I had to get Dad out of here really quickly, before<br />
he got hit by one of the rocks. So we sneaked in the castle after<br />
asking the guys on the gate for advice."</p>
<p>He strokes his nose in contemplation.</p>
<p>"Maybe we shouldn&#039;t have done that. But anyway we sneaked in here, and<br />
Caine&#039;s friend and I sneaked past some other guards. I think it was<br />
those two."</p>
<p>Nyano sweeps his other paw over the hapless guards, still laid out on the floor from Serendil&#039;s pacifist boomerang.</p>
<p>"but I&#039;m not really sure. Anyway, we get in here and that guy"</p>
<p>he jerks his head over to Duke Hyacinth&#039;s corpse</p>
<p>"was really rude to us, I don&#039;t really remember why. I think he tried<br />
to poison Caine&#039;s friend with tea. The butler over there probably knows<br />
more."</p>
<p>Nyano aims a kick in the butlers direction.</p>
<p>"Anyway it all got a bit confusing after people got poisoned, but<br />
anyway, Jebodiah here shoved the dead guy onto Caine&#039;s sword, then he<br />
grabbed his ring and tried to put it on. Then things got really<br />
confusing and the castle started disappearing and I was really mad at<br />
him for murdering someone, so I grabbed the ring. Since murders don&#039;t<br />
deserve to be in the nobility."</p>
<p>He pauses for a second to get the next part right in his head before he says it.</p>
<p>"Well then I saw that the floor was disappearing, and we&#039;re really<br />
quite high up, and Caine&#039;s friend was still unconcious and I&#039;m only a<br />
little raccoon and not very good at falling. And well... I kinda put<br />
the ring on. Besides, it felt really <i>wrong</i> when Jebodiah put the ring on, and I didn&#039;t have much time to think and stuff."</p>
<p>Nyano puts on his best cute face.</p>
<p>"and then things kinda worked out, and people didn&#039;t seem to be poisoned anymore. which is good, right?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>From Cain&#039;s coat pocket came Ilandra&#039;s voice.</p>
<p>"Cain&#039;s friend, by the way, was totally not Ilandra. And Ilandra had<br />
absolutely nothing to do with any of all this, honest! Indeed, Ilandra<br />
is currently at home waiting for Cain to go visit her..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Regara coughed.</p>
<p>"Right.  First of all, Ilandra, come out here please.  You&#039;re<br />
not fooling me, and you&#039;re also not in any trouble, so I&#039;d at least<br />
like to see you.</p>
<p>"You, peasant.  Jebodiah, was that your name?  What you did<br />
was thoroughly irresponsible, and if it weren&#039;t for Nyano&#039;s quick<br />
thinking you would all be dead.  I could very well have you<br />
hanged!  However, rightly or wrongly, your actions have resulted<br />
in an advantageous situation for my House.</p>
<p>"I have been informed that you command considerable respect among the<br />
people of the former Hyacinth duchy.  I am prepared to suggest<br />
something of a... special relationship between yourself and whomever<br />
governs these lands on my behalf."</p>
<p>She turned to the young raccoon, putting on a much friendlier face.</p>
<p>"The question is, Nyano - is that person you?  The land is yours<br />
by right.  House Poppy has men and women up to the task should you<br />
decline, though of course few of them have even heard of the gentleman<br />
here," she said, indicating Jebodiah.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Tentatively, Ilandra emerged from the pocket.</p>
<p>"Just for the record, we weren&#039;t running off... we merely got lost on<br />
the way back to mine..." she said. "And I should be in trouble<br />
really..." her voice sounded sad. "Anyway, please don&#039;t punish<br />
Jebodiah! He really did have everyone&#039;s best interest at heart and<br />
peasants are people too!! The previous Duke had forgotten that."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looked up from where he&#039;d been thinking and replied to the Duchess, a very serious expression on his face.</p>
<p>"I&#039;ve always been told that nobles should be responsible for their<br />
actions. The previous ruler here wasn&#039;t very responsible for his, so<br />
that means the next one ought to be.</p>
<p>It was my decision that made all this happen, so it&#039;s my responsibility<br />
to look after everything. I don&#039;t want this new barony to start with<br />
somebody ignoring their responsibilities.</p>
<p>If you&#039;ll let me, I&#039;ll look after these people."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Regara smiled.  "Well then, it&#039;s decided.  Baron<br />
Nyano-Sgiathatch of House Poppy, I hereby name you as governor of the<br />
lands formerly belonging to House Hyacinth.  I trust you will take<br />
as many advisors as necessary, and I think I see two likely candidates<br />
standing right here.</p>
<p>"Much as I hate to have to concern myself with such things, there is a<br />
certain amount of paperwork to take care of.  You need not concern<br />
yourself with it for now, you may refer any diplomats with whom you<br />
cannot deal to me.</p>
<p>"Before I return, Serendil - with circumstances as they were, I was not<br />
able to do this sooner, and for that I apologise.  On behalf of<br />
the House, I thank you for your actions two years past, and I hope that<br />
with all good luck it will not be necessary again.</p>
<p>"Jebodiah, I am sure that becoming a subject of House Poppy was not<br />
quite what you had planned.  However, I am sure that under Nyano&#039;s<br />
governance your people will be treated with much more respect than<br />
under Hyacinth&#039;s.  If either of you have any issues, you are<br />
welcome to call on me.</p>
<p>"Elaine, I...  Elaine?"</p>
<p>All eyes turned back to the table again, where a remarkably familiar figure was staring down at Duke Hyacinth&#039;s body.</p>
<p>"Interesing," she said.  "Killed by a peasant, but with a noble&#039;s sword.  Looks like you all had a lot of fun."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra tugged Cain&#039;s sleeve.</p>
<p>"What&#039;s she doing here?" she asked him quietly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain shrugged.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s the way I&#039;d have put it," said Regara, addressing<br />
the newcomer.  "So, besides making sarcastic remarks, why are you<br />
here?"</p>
<p>"Reconnaissance," replied Elaine.  "This one is the peasant Jebodiah, correct?" she asked, gesturing at him.</p>
<p>"Oi-" the old man began.</p>
<p>"Yes, that&#039;ll do," said Elaine.  "And the one with the highest<br />
density of residual glamour effets...  Nyano.  Regara, Poppy<br />
Duchess.  Ilandra, Honeysuckle Duchess.  Cain, Poppy<br />
Prince.  And..."  She cast her eyes about the room.<br />
"Sundry other nobles and peasants."</p>
<p>"Thank you for your time," Elaine said and in a flash she was gone,<br />
leaving nothing behind but a few black petals drifting slowly to the<br />
ground.</p>
<p>There were a few moments of silence.</p>
<p>"I have to say," said Regara, "that girl is really starting to annoy me."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I still don&#039;t like her." Ilandra said petulantly. "And what was that all about?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano turned to Jebodiah.</p>
<p>"Don&#039;t take it personally, she seems to be like that with everyone."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Who knows?" Regara said to Ilandra.  "Whatever business she&#039;s<br />
involved with, I can&#039;t help but get the feeling that she&#039;s got no-one&#039;s<br />
best interests at heart but her own - or those of whoever she<br />
represents.</p>
<p>"Well, with Elaine having disappeared again, that just leaves the two<br />
of you," she continued, her gaze flicking forth between Ilandra and<br />
Cain.  "What do you plan to do now?  Is there perchance a<br />
date I should be looking forward to yet?"</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>"Roight..." said Jebodiah.  "An&#039; who were she, &#039;xactly?  She seemed ta know an orful lot for someone who w&#039;ant &#039;ere!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra gulped. She looked towards the window, they were awfully high<br />
up. However, if she braced herself she could hit the ground gently<br />
enough not to break her legs and keep running... She particularly<br />
didn&#039;t like the way Regara was looking at them.<br />
She decided to stall the other duchess and answer Jebodiah&#039;s question.</p>
<p>"Elaine&#039;s, well... I don&#039;t think anyone really knows what she is... but<br />
she&#039;s creepy." she said, sidling closer to the window as she spoke. She<br />
gave Cain a meaningful look, undoing the catch and getting onto the<br />
windowsill. "As to a date, Regara... well, whenever I return... I<br />
suppose."</p>
<p>Flinging the window open, she concentrated and jumped out.</p>
<p><font color="red"> Please do the rolls for me.</font></p>
<hr />

<p>Outside, Ilandra touched the ground with cat-like grace despite the four-storey drop.</p>
<p>Cain looked at his mother, an embarrassed glow coming readily to his<br />
cheeks.  "Sorry," he said.  "We&#039;ll let you know!"  And<br />
with that, he flipped backwards out of the window to join his fiancÈ.</p>

<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked over at Cain.<br />
"Right, I&#039;ve arranged a pickup five minutes away..." she told him. "So, where next?"</p>
<p>Grabbing Cain&#039;s hand they ran to Hawthorn and jumped on.</p>
<p>"Now quickly, before your mother sends out guards." she said, "And the pickup is about five minutes south of here..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Regara rushed to the window, and didn&#039;t quite manage to suppress her<br />
sign of relief to see Cain and Ilandra galloping off into the poppy<br />
fields around the castle.</p>
<p>"When will they ever learn?" she muttered to herself.  And then, slightly quieter still: "Oh, to be young again..."</p>
<p>Chiding herself for those thoughts, she returned her attention to the rest of the room.</p>
<p>"Well then," she said, "unless anybody else needs me, I will be<br />
returning to Castle Poppy.  I&#039;m sure before very long I shall have<br />
to entertain important guests with questions to ask, and so on."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Have a safe trip!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Thank you," said Regara, smiling.</p>
<p>As the mists of glamour folded about her and she returned with her<br />
guards to Castle Poppy, Nyano almost thought he saw her wink and mouth<br />
the words &#039;well done&#039;...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looks at Jebodiah and his father.</p>
<p>"I guess we better start then."</p>
<p>Then he turns to the butler.</p>
<p>"Could you fetch the head of the army and the head of the castle servants for me?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The servant staggered to his feet, and scuttled off into the depths of the castle.</p>
<p>A few minutes later he returned, following two nobles.  One<br />
matched the servant rather closely in attire, though his bearing marked<br />
him out as clearly noble.  The other, in some semblance of an army<br />
uniform, supported himself on crutches as he made his way into the room.</p>
<p>Having delivered them as required, the butler bowed to Nyano and stepped backward towards the door.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Hello, I am Nyano-Sgiatatch of house Poppy, and this is my Father<br />
Serendil. What are your names?"  Nyano asked the two nobles after<br />
they&#039;d come in.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The two of them flicked their gazes rapidly across those present, dwelling particularly on the body of their former Duke.</p>
<p>"Geoffrey," said the head of the household staff simply, avoiding Nyano&#039;s gaze.</p>
<p>The other man remained polite, but only barely.  His eyes glinted<br />
with malice.  "Harvey.  Field Marshal Harvey.  Sir," he<br />
added, sarcasm dripping from every word.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"I know you don&#039;t like me very much right now, but please at least give me a chance."</p>
<p><font color="red">I&#039;d like to make a charisma + leadership test to out cute them at this point...</font></p>
<p>He turns to the sarcastic one first.</p>
<p>"What do you think about the current state of the barony?"</p>
<hr />

<p>"The Barony?"</p>
<p>The Field Marshall was clearly having trouble getting used to the concept.</p>
<p>"Right.  Well, you can imagine, can&#039;t you?  The place is torn<br />
up.  We&#039;ve lost 95 percent of our army due to some abysmal<br />
strategic decisions on behalf of our former allies, who now seem to<br />
have deserted us, and I would estimate approximately one third of the<br />
peasantry have lost their livelihoods or their lives."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Well do you want to make it better, or are you just going to sit around being angry?"</p>
<p>Nyano stops for a second.</p>
<p>"No wait, I&#039;m being mean. I&#039;m sorry." He looks apologetic, clutching<br />
one of his paws in another in front of him, "I want this place to be<br />
healthy and prosperous as much as you do, and to do that I could really<br />
do with your help."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"If I can put this place back on its feet again, I will," said the<br />
Field Marshal.  "But how?  No amount of strategic prowess is<br />
going to bring farmers back."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"I suppose it&#039;s lucky then that I don&#039;t have any amount of strategic<br />
prowess. Whatever that is. What I do have, is an advisor who<br />
understands what the farmers want."</p>
<p>Nyano looks over at Jebodiah</p>
<p>"What is it exactly that would make the farmers go back to their fields?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"You mean &#039;em not bein&#039; dead?  Tha&#039;d be a start.  Bu&#039; since<br />
tha&#039; ain&#039;t gonna happen, the ones that are as left moight want the<br />
reassur&#039;nce tha&#039; they&#039;s safe enough ta&#039; start rebuildin&#039;.<br />
No-one&#039;s gonna&#039; want to get ba&#039; ta normal if they think they&#039;re gonna&#039;<br />
have ta go to war again nex&#039; week!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Right, well that&#039;s easy enough. House Poppy doesn&#039;t have much of an<br />
army left. No one is going to expect us to go to war any time soon.</p>
<p>"Do you think we could invite some of the friendlier ones up to the castle and talk to them about it?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Moight be a good plan," said Jebodiah.  "Mister &#039;arvey, who&#039;s in charge&#039;a th&#039; reds out there?"</p>
<p>Field Marshal Harvey scowled, clearly not appreciating a peasant<br />
calling him "Mister" anything.  "Duke Cherry.  Frederick, I<br />
believe.  Shall I send some men to fetch him?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Please do that Field Marshal."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The Field Marshal nodded to the butler, who scuttled off into the<br />
depths of the castle to find a reasonably inoffensive-looking unit and<br />
replace their white trim with red.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, he returned leading a retinue of five<br />
soldiers.  The most imposing of them, and the most heavily<br />
armoured, was a dashing oriental-looking young man.  He took off<br />
his sword-belt and handed it to one of his soldiers, then nodded<br />
shallow bows to Nyano, Serendil and Harvey.</p>
<p>Another of his soldiers furnished the simple introduction.  "Duke Cherry, Baron Nyano-Sgiathatch Poppy."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"It&#039;s a bit late, but House Poppy would like to welcome you to our lands your grace."</p>
<p>Nyano tries his best to look small and harmless. Being a raccoon, his best is pretty effective.</p>
<p>"I&#039;ve been put in charge of this Barony, and it&#039;s suddenly become my<br />
job to make sure that the farmers go back to the fields and the people<br />
don&#039;t starve. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s going to happen if there&#039;s any more<br />
fighting around here.</p>
<p>"Could you tell me how likely that&#039;s going to be?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well," said Cherry, "the Whites having retreated as far as we know -"<br />
he flashed an almost apologetic smile at the Field Marshal "- from<br />
these lands, you should be reasonably secure here.  Buttercup to<br />
the South and Poppy to the East are back in Red hands.  To the<br />
West, Azalea was a Red ally, so I would not imagine the Whites holding<br />
on to it for too long.  To the North are Daisy, which should fall<br />
quickly, and the rather larger Duchy of Foxglove, which will be our big<br />
push after Daisy.</p>
<p>"However," he continued, "the Whites are very much on the run in this<br />
area.  We are expecting a two-front attack on Foxglove with my<br />
forces advancing from the South and another sizeable detachment from<br />
the West.</p>
<p>Duke Cherry coughed.  "My apologies, I seem to have gotten a<br />
little carried away.  What I mean to say, Baron, is that as our<br />
advance is going so well, we do hope that the front will never again be<br />
this far back.  Even if the tide of the war does turn back, the<br />
former Hyacinth land&#039;s terrain makes it difficult to attack.  Of<br />
all the smaller Duchies, this is one of the least vulnerable."</p>
