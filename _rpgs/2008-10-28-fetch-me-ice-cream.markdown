<p>"Nya!" the Duchess cries, attempting to go from sitting on her<br />
newly-dusted throne to hugging a two-foot-high raccoon in one<br />
motion.  The technique was, she reflects from her new position on<br />
the floor in front of you, probably best left to those who have concave<br />
rather than convex waistlines.</p>
<p>The woman tries to look as graceful as possible as she turns her<br />
face-fault into a kneel, and gives you a more sensibly unathletic hug.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s great to be back, isn&#039;t it!" she exclaims.  "Make sure your<br />
scouty lads check out the whole place before the party tonight,<br />
though.  Gotta&#039; make sure there aren&#039;t any more nasty enemies<br />
around!</p>
<p>"Oh, and, while you&#039;re there...  I&#039;ve got an even better use for<br />
your special skills!  On your way down to the barracks, you<br />
couldn&#039;t... stop by the kitchens, could you?  I&#039;m sure there&#039;ll be<br />
some ice cream in the ice-house.  You can help yourself - it&#039;s a<br />
party today!  But be a good boy and bring some up here for me,<br />
would you?  Thank you!!!"</p>
<p>With that explosive punctuation - and by some miracle the woman does<br />
seem capable of pronouncing all three exclamation marks - Duchess<br />
Regara hugs you even tighter for a moment before sending you on your<br />
way.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano stretches himself to his full height of 2 foot 3 inches before<br />
giving the Duchess a salute that would have made a four year old proud.</p>
<p>"I humbly accept your mission my Lady, the first Ice Cream procurement brigade is ready to march!"</p>
<p>With that he turns on his heels and steps boldly outwards towards the<br />
doors of the great hall. The entire procedure would have been flawless<br />
except that in his haste Nyano forgot he was holding a 6 foot long pike.</p>
<p>Eventually the small ball of raccoon, pike and bright green tunic<br />
managed to get themselves to the doorway, though the action was more<br />
akin to rolling than walking through court.</p>
<p>Before he leaves Nyano stops to brush himself down and grace the room<br />
with a bow, it&#039;s extravagance matched only by its enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Getting out to the corridor Nyano found himself greeted by a lone figure cloaked in a cloak made entirely of shaped smoke.</p>
<p>"I&#039;ve already had the men patrol the area sir, but if the Duchess ordered it, we&#039;ll do another sweep."</p>
<p>The raccoon looked up at his assistant scout-master with thanks in his<br />
eyes, "I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d do without you Andreas, you always manage<br />
to get stuff done before I think about it"</p>
<p>"Well what&#039;d I say to your father if I didn&#039;t deliver you back to him in one piece?"</p>
<p>The raccoon looked like it was about to cry "Do we have to talk about my father?"</p>
<p>"I&#039;m sure he&#039;s fine lad, besides don&#039;t you have a mission from the Duchess"</p>
<p>"oh yeah, ICE CREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"<br />
Wiping the tear from his cheek Nyano marches off towards the kitchen.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Nyano marches down the three flights of stairs to the kitchens, noting<br />
the increased tension amongst the servants with each floor he<br />
descends.  Upon his arrival, the entire kitchen is in<br />
uproar.  Not only the chefs, but all the serving staff and several<br />
other servants are dashing around like headless chickens trying to make<br />
jobs for themselves when in truth there is little they can do.</p>
<p>Apart from the mammoth mountain of washing-up that is being slowly<br />
devoured and ejected clean by a bunch of servants in the far corner of<br />
the room, it&#039;s apparent that little useful work is being done.<br />
The stoves aren&#039;t lit, and the cupboards are bare.</p>
<p>Most disturbingly of all, so is the freezer room.</p>
<p>No ice-cream.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano marches directly towards the freezer, his wearing his very best "I&#039;m on an important mission" expression.</p>
<p>"ICE CREAM FOR THE DUCHESS, THE DUCHESS DEMANDS HER ICE CREAM!"</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the freezer the shock is too much for his little mind<br />
to take, so he operates on instinct and goes directly for the honey<br />
pot. Finding that bare also he turns to the nearest servant with his<br />
huge eyes brimming.</p>
<p>"Why is there no ice cream?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The servant remains staring fixedly over Nyano&#039;s shoulder - not too<br />
difficult a feat - desipte the dairy-related interrogation.  After<br />
a few seconds, her voice seems to return to her just enough that she<br />
stutters "p... po... potato..." before passing out.</p>
<p>A cry of "follow that vegetable!" resounds from the kitchen staff, and<br />
several of the more athletic servants dash after the potato that is now<br />
running for the kitchen door.</p>
<p>An elderly noble who in all the confusion has ended up standing next to<br />
Nyano looks confused for a moment before seeming to hit upon an<br />
idea.  He kneels down next to the raccoon and whispers.</p>
<p>"Hey, you know what?  You can make potatoes into <i>really</i><br />
nice ice cream.  If only there was someone to catch it for us -<br />
it&#039;s very fast, and since it&#039;s so small us big folk might not be able<br />
to follow it..."</p>
