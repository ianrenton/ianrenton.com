<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>None of the six who spent that night in the clearing slept much,<br />
whether through sentry duty or the thought that it would not be twelve<br />
hours before they reached Hyacinth Castle, and whatever was to be<br />
decided there.</p>
<p>They awoke, or at least saw in the daylight, to an overcast sky that<br />
threatened rain.  Dew lay damply on the ground, soaking through<br />
their clothes and making the preparations to break camp a decidedly<br />
unpleasant experience.</p>
<p>Before long, though, their effort had shaken the water from them and they set off on their way northward towards the castle.</p>
<p>"Only &#039;few hours t&#039;go," said Jebodiah as once again the old scout moved<br />
ahead of the rest of the group.  "We&#039;ll be there &#039;afore noon."</p>
<p>Hawthorn snorted and shook his mane, spraying out droplets of<br />
water.  Cain moved over to him and placed his hand on the horse&#039;s<br />
neck.  If they shared their thoughts, Cain made no effort to<br />
enlighten the rest of the group.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Grumbling irritably at the dampness around her, Ilandra ran to catch up with Cain and Hawthorn.</p>
<p>"Ugh, I&#039;m still damp!" she grumbled to herself. "Morning, Hawthorn."<br />
she hesitated a few seconds before holding Cain&#039;s free hand. "Looks<br />
like it&#039;s not long now before you don&#039;t have to carry so much stuff<br />
like this..." the forced cheeriness in her voice didn&#039;t quite manage to<br />
hide the (incredibly ill-concealed) irritation at still being damp.<br />
"Also, where&#039;s Nyano?"</p>
<p>(OC: have you ever got a cat wet? easiest way to get a homicidal creature in less than 5 seconds...)</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano pops his suprisingly dry head out from amongst the packs on Hawthornes back, then drops himself neatly onto the ground.</p>
<p>"Here I am! Are we going now?"</p>
<p>He chews absentmindedly on the back of one of his paws.</p>
<p>"I hope we get their soon, I think my father might be there."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra did a brief double-take at the sudden appearance of the raccoon then looked up at Cain, tugging on his sleeve.</p>
<p>"How come I&#039;m not allowed to ride in Hawthorn&#039;s saddle bags?" she asked, in a small voice. "And he&#039;s dry!"</p>
<p>She sniffled a little.</p>
<p>"I need a hug!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I, er," spluttered Cain.  "I suppose you can, if you like.<br />
Ride in the saddlebags, that is.  There&#039;s enough space.<br />
Though, er..."  He quietened his voice to a whisper.  "But<br />
the other two don&#039;t know yet, do they?  You know, about you<br />
changing shape.  They might sort of freak out..."</p>
<p>He thought for a second, then realised what he had forgotten, and hugged Ilandra.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;d rather have a piggyback..." Ilandra murmured, winding her fingers in Cain&#039;s hair.  "Or ride in your pockets..."</p>
<p>She kissed his cheek.</p>
<p>"You&#039;re right, they probably would freak out... though Jebodiah already<br />
knows... I don&#039;t think very much gets past him. To be honest, I wasn&#039;t<br />
surprised that he didn&#039;t seem to mind Nyano&#039;s sudden appearance." She<br />
looked down at Nyano. "What if your father&#039;s not at Hyacinth Castle? Do<br />
you want us to help you find him?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Well if he&#039;s not there, I bet we&#039;ll find a clue! I&#039;m on a quest,<br />
that&#039;s how things work, or at least thats what Prince Abel told me<br />
once, and he knows EVERYTHING."</p>
<p>He pauses to think for a minute.</p>
<p>"Nobody told me if I was allowed to have people helping me on my quest,<br />
but you&#039;re older than me, you probably know how it works better than I<br />
do. If it&#039;s ok, could you help me? I&#039;m only a little raccoon, and this<br />
is a big quest."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I can&#039;t see why not... it might even be on the way to where we&#039;re<br />
going..." Ilandra said. "I don&#039;t know about being allowed help on<br />
quests, though I&#039;ve never heard of anyone not being allowed help on<br />
quests... so we might as well help you." She looked at Cain. "Unless<br />
you have something else in mind..."</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we&#039;ll help. Though I need to have a word with you."</p>
<p><font color="red">OOC: Just to clarify, the last sentence was spoken by<br />
Ilandra to Nyano... sorry, I re-read this after a few days and it<br />
didn&#039;t seem clear to me so I figured I&#039;d clarify for just in case<br />
anyone else gets confused... </font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looked relieved, he straightened his little raccoon shoulders and met Illandra&#039;s eyes.</p>
<p>"Thank you. I should admit that I was a little afraid of doing such a big quest all by myself."</p>
<p>He checked to see that no one who wasn&#039;t a Hyacynth, a Poppy or a<br />
horse  was nearby. When he was certain they weren&#039;t being spied<br />
upon he turned back to Illandra.</p>
<p>"What is it you want to talk to me about?"</p>
<hr />

Cain: Poppy, noble<br />
Jebodiah: Hyacinth (barely), peasant<br />
Solid Snape: Hyacinth, peasant<br />
An Hero: Hyacinth, peasant<br />
Hawthorn: Absolutely a real horse.</p>
<p>Jebodiah&#039;s eyes seem to shine even brighter now that you&#039;re looking for<br />
traces of glamour.  They are clearly magical, but it&#039;s not a<br />
result of any cantrip you know of.  It also feels somewhat alien<br />
to the body in which it resides - it doesn&#039;t look like the golden eyes<br />
are intrinsically Jebodiah&#039;s.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well my cousin bumped into us recently... and she erm..." Ilandra<br />
looked a little sheepish. "Can I just ask that you don&#039;t use Cain as<br />
bait? I don&#039;t mind anyone using me as bait, but... it just bugs me."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"What?" Nyano looks confused. He takes a second to think. "Oh, you mean<br />
the plan! I wasn&#039;t going to use anybody as anything without asking<br />
them. It was just an idea. Besides, your cousin must have been<br />
confused, it didn&#039;t involve using either of you as bait separately. It<br />
was just a way to make your wedding more secure."</p>
<p>He pauses for breath.</p>
<p>"You are going to get married, aren&#039;t you? They sent an assasin to one<br />
of our big parties, I bet they&#039;ll send another one when you get<br />
married. It doesn&#039;t really have anything to do with bait. The plan was<br />
to send the entire party to Mortalia once everyone had arrived, but<br />
without telling the servants. So that the assasin gets left in a castle<br />
full of guards with no guests, and Hugh arranges a big party for you in<br />
Mortalia."</p>
<p>Nyano wrings his hands.</p>
<p>"I didn&#039;t really want anyone to get hurt."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked stunned.</p>
<p>"Oh." she managed after a few seconds. "Well, in that case... may I<br />
offer our sincere apologies... I mean mine and Akane&#039;s. I&#039;ll see that<br />
her wires get uncrossed again the next time I see her..."<br />
She jumped down from her perch in Cain&#039;s arms and bowed to Nyano.</p>
<p>"I am so incredibly sorry for this misunderstanding... It was very<br />
sweet of you to take our safety into account like that." she dropped<br />
her voice. "Would you mind being a page boy?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Do I get to wear a big white tabard, and a hat with a feather in it?"</p>
<p>Nyano&#039;s eyes sparkle at his imagined finery.</p>
<p>"I&#039;d do anything for a hat with a feather in it."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Of course! And you&#039;d get to carry a velvet cushion and everything!" she said.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Ahead of them the three peasants had stopped at the crest of the hill and were staring at what lay over it in silence.</p>
<p>As the nobles reached the top, they saw why.</p>
<p>The forest finished abruptly in a line stretching far into the east and<br />
the west.  In front of them lay a bowl-like valley almost as big<br />
as the entirety of Poppy kingdom, with not a tree in sight.  It<br />
looked like every square inch of it had once been carpeted with<br />
hyacinth flowers, barring the occasional rock and the magnificent<br />
gleaming spires of the town and castle set exactly at its centre.</p>
<p>No longer, however.  The castle&#039;s fairytale spires were battered<br />
and crumbling, showing gaping holes and smashed stone where once the<br />
walls were bright and gleaming marble.  Its defensive walls,<br />
insubstantial though they would have been in the first place, lay in<br />
pieces.  The surrounding town hadn&#039;t fared any better - scuttling<br />
figures could just about be seen rushing to and from several burning<br />
buildings.  Where once bloomed flowers as far as the eye could<br />
see, now there were but wilting stems and patches of blackened ash.</p>
<p>Taking up a good quarter of the valley, though, were two massed<br />
armies.  Thousands; tens of thousands of soldiers stood in rank<br />
and file, facing their opponents over a few hundred yards of flat<br />
land.  Their pennants, variously in red and white, left no doubt<br />
about what was going on.</p>
<p>Toward the farther side of the valley, Red forces from several houses<br />
stood together in protection of a row of giant siege engines that even<br />
now rained stones upon Hyacinth castle.  Nearer to the watchers<br />
stood the Whites, looking to outnumber the Reds slightly.</p>
<p>In the middle of the expanse that separated the armies, several mounted<br />
nobles with opposing flags stood presumably in heated conversation<br />
prior to the battle.  Though almost five miles distant from Nyano<br />
and Ilandra, the sense of tension was apparent even to them.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra surveyed the chaos before her.</p>
<p>"I think I might still be able to get us to the castle... but I don&#039;t<br />
know how much soldiers care about diplomatic immunity..." she said,<br />
doubtfully. "Mind you, we&#039;re not a big group so we might get by..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looked at the spectacle before him. His soul slowly turning numb at the sheer number of faeries in the field.</p>
<p>"My father&#039;s down there" he muttered to himself quietly. Then he came back to himself and looked up to Illandra.</p>
<p>"Do we even want to go to the castle now? Maybe we should ask the man with the strange eyes."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked across at Jebodiah.</p>
<p>"We still going to the castle?" she asked. "Cos that&#039;s an awful lot of soldiers..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Weeeehl," said Jebodiah, who didn&#039;t look like he&#039;d expected a<br />
battlefield either.  "It does look a bit unfriendly down &#039;ere,<br />
don&#039; it?  It ain&#039;t the armies Oi&#039;m worried &#039;bout, they ain&#039;t<br />
loikely ta notice us.  But tha castle&#039;s still bein&#039; shot at by<br />
them tre...bur...things."</p>
<p>He stood in silence for a few seconds.</p>
<p>"Still," he said, stepping forward then turning to face the<br />
others.  "You&#039;s all free ta&#039; make &#039;yer own decisions.  Me,<br />
oi&#039;m carryin&#039; on.  Oi&#039;ve come too far, an&#039; made too many prom&#039;ses<br />
ta back out now."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano ducks back into Hawthorne&#039;s saddlebag, obviously figuring that he&#039;ll let the horse make the scary decisions.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"We made a promise to Nyano that we&#039;d help him on his quest and he said<br />
he had a lead that would take him to the castle." Ilandra said. "I<br />
don&#039;t like the fact there&#039;s trebuchets... but we could try asking the<br />
generals to back down if it&#039;s too much of a problem... alternatively we<br />
could just get moving and see how it goes..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Sloight problem there, miss," said Jebodiah.  "Though we don&#039;<br />
&#039;ave ta go through th&#039; armies ta get ta the castle, Oi think we moight<br />
to get ta their war m&#039;chines.  &#039;Course, we could always wait &#039;til<br />
the battle&#039;s over.  Whoever wins, Oi&#039;m sure the tre...things&#039;ll<br />
stop."</p>
<p>He thought in silence again.</p>
<p>"Though Oi&#039;m sure there&#039;ll be Hy&#039;cinth soldiers out there.  If Oi<br />
can stop them - if Oi can stop any&#039;a th&#039; peasant folk bein&#039; killed for<br />
this damn war, Oi&#039;m goin&#039; to!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Oh for the love of..." Ilandra grabbed the older guy&#039;s arm and started<br />
marching towards the castle. "We are going to sort this mess out. Right<br />
now!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Jebodiah shot Ilandra an unnerving golden glare and removed his arm<br />
from her grip.  With a hand signal he waved the two other peasants<br />
into position at the front of the group, while Cain and Hawthorn -<br />
still with Nyano in his saddlebags - following on behind.</p>
<p>The six of them headed down the gently sloping side of the<br />
valley.  Though the sun shone brightly overhead, what it shone on<br />
would not have been pretty in any light.  Either side of the wide<br />
track on which they travelled, wilted hyacinth plants sulked on every<br />
available patch of soil.  Now and again, swathes of trampled or<br />
burnt plants marked the marches and skirmishes of some army or another.</p>
<p>The path curved slowly to the right before heading directly to the<br />
castle, taking them further from the massed troops.  Though they<br />
passed several small houses on the way, there was no-one in<br />
sight.  Once or twice, a flick of a shadow behind a rock or a<br />
rustling in a patch of taller vegetation may have been an army&#039;s scout<br />
patrol, or then again it could have been their own scout.  Either<br />
way, nobody approached them or demanded to know who they were.</p>
<p>After nearly an hour, their path led them through the streets of the<br />
town that surrounded Hyacinth Castle.  The buildings that had been<br />
burning earlier had been extinguished and no new ones appeared to be<br />
alight, though the destruction around them was near total.  As<br />
many houses lay in ruins as still stood intact, each of the latter full<br />
to bursting point with displaced peasants.  The six of them<br />
received no shortage of angry, sad and questioning looks as they picked<br />
their way through fallen timber and chunks of stone towards the castle.</p>
<p>The first set of gates, those in the utterly ineffective defensive<br />
wall, somehow still stood - and not only that, they were still<br />
guarded!  Two men, clearly nobles and so presumably low-ranking<br />
officers, stood either side of the closed wooden gates.  Their<br />
uniforms featured white details alongside the traditional Hyacinth<br />
uniform.</p>
<p>The group paused for a moment fifty yards or so from the gates -<br />
Jebodiah in front, flanked by the other two peasants, Ilandra close<br />
behind, then Cain and Hawthorn with Nyano poking his head out of the<br />
saddlebags - as half a ton of rock fell screaming from the sky and<br />
smashed one of the castle&#039;s smaller towers into rubble.  Another<br />
plume of dust joined the many others in rising into the noonday sky.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra rolled her sleeves up, cracked her knuckles and took a step forward.</p>
<p>"Well, come on then!" she said, walking towards the main entrance. "What&#039;s the worst that could happen?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, ah..." said Cain, but it was clear that no-one was paying<br />
attention.  Ilandra was heading straight for the gate and the<br />
peasants, buoyed by her enthusiasm, were joining her.  He sighed,<br />
shared a knowing glance with Hawthorn, and the two of them plus their<br />
rodent cargo followed on after the other four.</p>
<p>Closer in, they could see the expressions on the guards&#039; faces.<br />
&#039;Panicked&#039; was probably the word, though &#039;fretting&#039; would also do just<br />
fine.  It was abundantly clear that more than anything else they<br />
wanted to be anywhere but guarding the gate of a collapsed wall whilst<br />
rocks rained down around them.</p>
<p>Both of them made the effort to concentrate as the strange group approached.</p>
<p>"Halt!" said the larger of the two.  "Who goes there, and what&#039;s your business here?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m duchess Honeysuckle and I demand an audience and a cup of tea!"<br />
Ilandra told them, pushing past. "Oh and this is my retinue... run<br />
along and find your duke for me..."</p>
<p>She waved lazily towards the castle in a shooing motion, still walking towards the castle.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The smaller guard moved across to whisper to his colleague.</p>
<p>"That&#039;s a, er, pretty odd retinue you have there, Miss," he said once<br />
the whispering had finished.  "Er, your Grace.  If you really<br />
<i>are</i> a Duchess."</p>
<p>"Anyway," continued the larger, "even if you are, you can&#039;t have an<br />
audience with the Duke.  He&#039;s, er...  He&#039;s not here."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>[<font>Private<br />
to GM: Two nobles and a couple of peasants is an odd retinue for a<br />
duchess now? Also what is Nyano&#039;s actual rank. If you don&#039;t pick<br />
something, he&#039;s going to start refering to himself as an Earl when<br />
trying to impress commoners.</font>]</p>
<p>Nyano popped his head out of the saddlebag, twitching his snout at the guards.</p>
<p>"Not here?" He squeaked "What do you mean not here? This is his castle isn&#039;t it?"</p>
<p>He looked at the guards in procyon shock. "Do you mean to say he&#039;s refusing us hospitality. That&#039;s terribly bad manners."</p>
<p>He put on his most mournful expression as he appraised the guards, "I<br />
wouldn&#039;t want to be the poor gateguard responsible for refusing<br />
hospitality to a Duchess when it&#039;s raining giant rocks outside. I do<br />
hope she won&#039;t take it personally."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked at the guards, sadness emanating from her every pore.</p>
<p>"But... but... I really really wanted that cup of tea..." she said, her<br />
eyes brimming. "Couldn&#039;t you at least let me in? I am not lying! And<br />
besides, I&#039;m allowed any retinue I damned well want! It&#039;s the point of<br />
being me!"</p>
<p>She flashed Jebodiah an apologetic look.</p>
<p>"Can you not see the giant rocks raining down? Come on, My house is<br />
totally neutral, even if he was in I wouldn&#039;t hurt him!" she looked at<br />
the guard. "Pretty please?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>[<font>Private<br />
to Nyano-Sgiathatch: A man with eerie gold eyes and only one horse<br />
between the lot of them?  That is *fairly* odd...  Nyano&#039;s<br />
rank can be pretty much anything you like (below Duke, obviously).</font>]</p>
<p>The guards looked nervously at each other.</p>
<p>"Well, ah, the castle is rather the target of the rocks.  If you<br />
really must take shelter inside I suppose you&#039;re welcome, but,<br />
ah...  Outside might be a lot safer."</p>
<p>The guards whispered to each other again, not quite quietly enough.</p>
<p>"But the Duke said &#039;not even the King and Queen themselves!"</p>
<p>"Do you think he&#039;s really going to care anymore?</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Look, the siege isn&#039;t stopping, is it?  Any minute a rock could<br />
kill us, or him.  Does guarding the gate of some smashed-up wall<br />
even matter now?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Thankyou! Thankyou! Thankyou!" Ilandra gushed, bouncing up and hugging the first guard. "Now please let us in..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Wait, we didn&#039;t agree..." spluttered one of the guards.</p>
<p>The other sighed.  "Look," he said, "there&#039;s probably someone else<br />
watching the gates, and if we let you in they&#039;ll probably give us guard<br />
duty here until the Reds are at our throats.  Go that way," he<br />
pointed to the right along the wall.  "Two hundred yards.<br />
The wall&#039;s collapsed enough you can just walk right through.<br />
We&#039;ll be looking over here and whistling quite loudly.  Got<br />
it?  Er... your Grace?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>She leaned towards the guards<br />
"You know, if you like I can give you asylum on my land..." she said,<br />
in a low voice. "There&#039;s no sieges there cos we&#039;re neutral..."<br />
She hid this by hugging both guards again before skipping towards the hole in the wall that they&#039;d pointed out.</p>
<p>"Well come on then!" she called to the others.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>With varied shrugs and confused expressions, the others followed<br />
Ilandra south along the wall until they reached a likely-looking<br />
collapsed section.  The ground was strewn with enough rubble that<br />
walking across it was difficult, doubly so for Hawthorn.  After a<br />
few minutes, though, they had all made their way safely to the other<br />
side.</p>
<p>All around them were what would once have been gardens, though they had<br />
suffered even worse than the land outside the town.  Not only were<br />
withered patches of grass and smouldering black scars more commonplace<br />
than healthy-looking areas, but six or seven large rocks and their<br />
associated craters marred the once flat ground.</p>
<p>From inside the wall, the castle&#039;s state was even more apparent.<br />
As they watched, even though there had been no direct hits in a good<br />
five minutes, parapets and crenelations cracked off from the main body<br />
of the castle and fell to the ground in plumes of dust and shrapnel.</p>
<p>A side entrance to a reasonably intact-looking section of the castle<br />
stood not far from them.  It was unguarded - in fact, inside of<br />
the wall they had not seen a single living soul, in marked contrast to<br />
the packed houses and activity in the streets outside.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra wandered over to the door, looking back at the others.</p>
<p>"Let&#039;s see what&#039;s inside..."</p>
<p><font color="red"> Cut to the chase, Renton</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain left Hawthorn outside, trusting that he would look after himself<br />
and not get hit by anything.  Nyano jumped out from the saddlebags<br />
and headed inside with the rest of them.</p>
<p>Once inside the door, it became readily apparent where all the people<br />
they had been expecting were.  Though they could just about escape<br />
notice by standing just inside the door, and there seemed to have been<br />
no great alarm at the door opening, peeking around the corners revealed<br />
the place to be swarming with soldiers.</p>
<p>It was entirely possible that some quirk of fate had led them straight to the Hyacinths&#039; barracks.</p>
<p>At the far end of the room, a door led out into what presumably was the<br />
rest of the castle.  In the way, though, were various signs of an<br />
army in panic - soldiers rushing about the place, heavily-stacked<br />
weapons racks, piles of armour and shields, and so on.</p>
<p>"Roight," said Jebodiah.  "This weren&#039;t exactly &#039;ow Oi &#039;oped this bit&#039;d go.  Any oideas, people?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Sweet lover of..." Ilandra murmured under her breath. "I have a plan."</p>
<p>She turned to Cain.</p>
<p>"Don&#039;t panic... I&#039;ll try not to get hurt." She told him before melting into her cat shape and setting off down the hall.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looked after the duchess and figured that one raccoon wasn&#039;t<br />
going to be particularly noticeable in that mess. So he hurried off<br />
into the crowd after Illandra.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Wow!" exclaimed the young man with the swords.  "So she really <i>is</i> a Duchess!"</p>
<p>Slowly, deceptively slowly, the others turned to look at him.</p>
<p>"Oh, shit.  Whoops."</p>
<p>"Did you hear something?" came a soldier&#039;s voice from across the room?</p>
<p>"Yeah," said another.  "Must be someone arsing around.  Let&#039;s take a look."</p>
<p>The bandanna&#039;d man&#039;s eyes flicked back and forth in a panic before<br />
alighting on a set of cardboard boxes of varying sizes in the corner.</p>
<p>"Quick!" he whispered.  "Get inta&#039; the boxes!"</p>

<p>Leaving naught but clouds of cartoonish dust behind them, the four of<br />

<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra carried on down the hallway, mewing quietly whenever she<br />
thought she was being watched too closely, looking for a room that<br />
contained someone that looked like a duke.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Ilandra snuck through the door of the barracks, with Nyano following in<br />
the shadows close behind.  The corridor beyond opened out in each<br />
direction, with numerous doors leading off.  Upstairs and<br />
downstairs were both much the same, with occasional locked doors and<br />
destroyed sections forcing them to try other routes through the<br />
castle.  Passers-by paid them little heed, in the main having far<br />
more urgent things to occupy them than the ingress of local wildlife.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in the barracks, a sequence of mightily stupid soldiers<br />
had completely failed to notice the slow but steady progress of four<br />
large cardboard boxes across the floor.  They sat near the door<br />
for some time, unable to escape from the soldiers&#039; gaze since the door<br />
was visible from all over the room.</p>
<p>With luck, though, after a few minutes a call to muster came from<br />
outside and the majority of them kitted up and left.  Presumably,<br />
something was going on out on the battlefield...</p>
<p>Once outside the room Jebodiah and the old scout shared a hushed<br />
conversation, and the latter disappeared with haste down a corridor.</p>
<p>"What was that about?" Cain asked.</p>
<p>"Jus&#039; gonna foind sommat fer me," the old man replied.  "Pers&#039;nal business."</p>
<p>Cain pressed the point no further, and the three of them headed up through the castle in search of the Duke.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Two floors up from the barracks, Ilandra and Nyano had worked their way<br />
around to what they assumed from the carpets and the elaborate<br />
furnishings to be the nobles&#039; area of the castle.  Not a noble was<br />
in sight, though, and they passed by a few servants and guards.</p>
<p>It wasn&#039;t long before they reached a great marble staircase, its<br />
grandeur only slightly marred by the fact that it was missing several<br />
large chunks.  Downward it stretched to what must have been the<br />
main entrance, whilst up a floor the stairs ended abruptly with another<br />
door.</p>
<p>Just like the gate there were two guards here, also nobles.  They<br />
did not wear the military uniform that the soldiers wore, though -<br />
theirs was much more elaborate and featured more shades of blue and<br />
purple than any dress coat should have.  They looked determined to<br />
the others&#039; terrified, despite the fact that a missile had clearly<br />
removed several of the steps not twenty feet in front of them.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Bingo!" Ilandra muttered to herself, approaching the group.</p>
<p><i> Now to see which of these likely lads is gonna take me to Hyacinth </i></p>
<p>She morphed out of her cat form, still wandering over to them.</p>
<p>"Hi, I seem to be lost..." she fluttered her eyelashes at the two guards. "I was looking for a guy..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The guards eyed her warily.  "Looking for a guy?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Yeah, kinda tall-ish, attractive and slightly spineless... Know anyone matching those characteristics?" she asked.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Spineless?"</p>
<p>The two guards shared a knowing glance.</p>
<p>"That&#039;s not a very polite way of referring to His Grace, if indeed you<br />
were.  Besides, you&#039;re in the wrong place.  He&#039;s out on the<br />
battlefield with the army."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"He so isn&#039;t! I checked and the lovely gentlemen told me that he&#039;d be<br />
around here. Wasn&#039;t that nice of them?" she said, drawing herself up to<br />
her full height (of 5&#039;4"). "Come on, he&#039;ll totally want to see me! I&#039;ll<br />
make it worth your while?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I doubt you could make it worth our while, Miss.  Besides, if<br />
he&#039;s not with the army then we don&#039;t know where he is, so we can&#039;t take<br />
you to him anyway.</p>
<p>"Now, is there anything else we can help you with?  In case you<br />
hadn&#039;t noticed, it&#039;s not exactly safe for you to be around here."</p>

<p>"Hmm, so you won&#039;t mind if I look around?" she took a step towards them.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p><font color="red">While not 100% sure, you&#039;re pretty confident they&#039;re not quite telling the truth.</font></p>
<p>"Yes we will, I&#039;m afraid.  Regardless of where His Grace is, we still have orders not to let anyone beyond these doors."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"OK, OK... I&#039;ll back down..." she said, putting her hands up. "What<br />
could I do to help you change your minds? I&#039;m unarmed, as you can see<br />
so I&#039;m no threat and I have nothing to do with the war."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"We all having something to do with the war these days, Miss.  And there&#039;s very little you could do to convince us."</p>
<p>He straightened up a little taller than usual, pushing the seven foot mark.</p>
<p>"Our loyalty was the reason we were chosen for this position, you know."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>While they&#039;re distracted, Nyano attempts to sneak past.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Fine." she pouted for a second or two then took in a deep breath. "HEY<br />
YOUR GRACE! I KNOW YOU&#039;RE IN THERE, I WANNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER OF<br />
SANCTUARY!"</p>
<p>"Sorry guys, did I forget to mention I have a totally neutral house and<br />
a hospital and loads of vacancies for extra people?" she asked.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>There was a protracted silence, during which the guards looked somewhat nervous.</p>
<p>Nyano took the opportunity of the loud noise to sneak past the guards undetected, to stand between them and the door.</p>
<p>"You have a <i>house</i>?" asked one of the guards skeptically.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Erm, yeah. Don&#039;t you know who I am?" she asked, smiling mischievously.<br />
"I&#039;m from House Honeysuckle, sent on behalf of the duchess... will you<br />
let me in now?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well..." said the other.  "No.  We have our orders."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Couldn&#039;t one of you at least let him know I&#039;m here and want to help<br />
him live?" she asked. She was trying to make it clear she wouldn&#039;t<br />
leave unless she saw him.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Having accomplished his first trick, Nyano was about to try for his second.</p>
<p>Sadly he is a very small raccoon, and in front of him was a very big<br />
door. He could hear the guards talking to Illandra behind him, so he<br />
figured he had a couple of seconds before they looked around.</p>
<p>He took one quick step forward, then another, and finally with the<br />
third step made a flying raccoon leap towards the doorhandle...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Maybe we could if we knew where he-"</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Nyano, dangling a foot or so off the ground, swung open with the door.  The guards turned around in surprise...</p>
<p><font color="red">Ilandra, if you&#039;re about to do what you told me OC,<br />
do so.  Nyano, if you&#039;re about to do something other than drop off<br />
the doorhandle and look into the room, post that too.</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Bingo!" she said as she morphed back into a cat and ran into the room.</p>
<p>Once inside she looked around.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The guards paused for a second in shock, having thoroughly not expected to be outfoxed by unexpected wildlife.</p>
<p>Given their bare headstart, Nyano and Ilandra raced into the room beyond the doors.</p>
<p>The room was expansive and expensive in equal measure, all carpeted in<br />
a rich bluey-purple and wallpapered with similar shades.<br />
Portraits and hunting trophies took pride of place on the walls, though<br />
the room was dominated by a gigantic bay window perhaps thirty feet<br />
across.  It would doubtless have been magnificent when it let in<br />
the morning light, but now it let in the afternoon light and a hefty<br />
draft.</p>
<p>The reason for this was readily apparent, for not far from it a tangled<br />
mess of floorboards and a protruding rock marked the site of the latest<br />
impact.</p>
<p>And, in front of that rock and looking down at it with considerable<br />
irritation, stood a man blond of hair and blue of eye, pointed of ear<br />
and pointed of boots and seven feet between them.  He turned to<br />
face the intruders, golden buttons on his blue frock-coat glinting in<br />
the remains of light from the window.</p>
<p>His lips stayed untelling, though his eyes flashed with what might have been malice or might have been amusement.</p>
<p>"My, my," he said, his voice sugary-sweet and reeking of danger.  "And what have we here?"</p>
<p>Behind Nyano and Ilandra, the guards that had briefly tried to pursue<br />
them caught the look in Duke Hyacinth&#039;s eyes, and stood rooted to the<br />
spot.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Catching the dangerous look, Nyano defaulted to his natural cuteness.</p>
<p>Clutching one paw in another he turned to the tall man and asked:</p>
<p>"I&#039;m sorry to bother you sir. But I&#039;m on a Quest. Have you seen my father?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra morphed back into her fae form.</p>
<p><font color="red"> Man in uniform alert! Roll willpower!<br />

<p>"You&#039;re Duke Hyacinth?" she managed, walking slowly and (she hoped) seductively towards him.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Your father?" asked Hyacinth.  "Can&#039;t say one has, but then one tends not to associate with his..."</p>
<p>He faltered as he noticed Ilandra.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra shook her head a little, as though she was trying to clear her mind.</p>
<p>"Well, you&#039;re pretty and they said such bad things about you and it&#039;s surprising..." she burbled.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano was so caught up in his quest that he failed to notice the duke&#039;s distraction.</p>
<p>"But but you must have seen him. The messenger said he was here. His name is Serendil."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, one does try to keep up appearances," said Hyacinth, flicking<br />
back his hair, "but it has become somewhat more difficult of late.</p>
<p>"Now," he said, turning to Nyano, "if you are looking for a member of my staff, you had better ask my-"</p>
<p>He would have continued but for the sudden appearance of Jebodiah at<br />
the door.  The old man pushed his way past the stunned guards and<br />
into the room, waggling his walking stick at Duke Hyacinth.</p>
<p>"Duke Hyacinth!" he shouted, his voice carrying remarkable<br />
fervour.  "You have abused this country and its people long<br />
enough!  The people of the Duchy of Hyacinth demand your immediate<br />
abdication!"</p>
<p>The Duke just chuckled.  "So," he said, "one sees the curse has<br />
driven you mad after all!  One knew it could not have taken long."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"You cursed Jebodiah?" Ilandra tore her eyes from Duke Hyacinth and seemed slightly less distracted. "But why?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"It was his punishment, for wanting to know- Ouch!"</p>
<p>The Duke was interrupted mid-sentence, as was becoming the fashion, by<br />
a darkly clad figure vaulting in through the window with his bandanna<br />
trailing behind him.  The old scout landed virtually on top of<br />
Hyacinth, bowling him to the ground, the weight of him supplemented by<br />
the furry bundle he carried under one arm.</p>
<p>"Jebodiah, it&#039;s all set up," he said as his grappling hook retracted of its own accord.</p>
<p>"Oh, and... Nyano, was it?  Did you mean this guy?"</p>
<p>He dropped the furry bundle to the floor, from where it unfolded itself into a rather burly-looking adult raccoon.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"DAD!"</p>
<p>Nyano rushes over to his father.</p>
<p>"Are you hurt? Is everything ok?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Serendil grunted, and stepped forward to hug his son - standing heavily on Hyacinth&#039;s arm in the process.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m fine," he said, "but man, am I surprised to see you!  How did you even know where I was being held?"</p>
<p>With two people at once standing on his prone form, Duke Hyacinth finally exploded.</p>
<p>"Peasants!" he screamed.  "Get off me this instant!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"On come now, Dukey, they obviously haven&#039;t seen each other in a<br />
while... and neither of them are peasants." Ilandra said. "Least, I<br />
don&#039;t think they are..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"There was a messenger... Didn&#039;t you send him?"</p>
<p>Nyano looks confused for a moment. "Anyway, you&#039;re ok now. And we have our castle back and everything."</p>
<p>He fishes at his belt for something, and pulls out his boomerang.</p>
<p>"I know you say that violence is bad, but isn&#039;t this one of those special exceptions you don&#039;t like to talk about?"</p>
<p>He holds the boomerang out to his father.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"You know," said Serendil, "I think it might be."</p>
<p>Almost as if summoned by the prospect of extreme violence the youngest<br />
of the three peasants burst in, knocking the doors back on their hinges.</p>
<p>"You will pay for your crimes!" he shouted in Hyacinth&#039;s general<br />
direction, severely over-estimating how cool he sounded.  "Prepare<br />
to meet your doom!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"OK, see this is where politically it gets kinda tricky for me..."<br />
Ilandra said, looking at Nyano and the Duke. "Kinda hard to maintain<br />
neutrality in the middle of a fight."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Oh, One has had enough of this," said Hyacinth from the floor.  "Guards!"</p>
<p>The guards didn&#039;t move - not, this time, out of fear of their master,<br />
but rather out of fear of the poppy-red and summer-gold sabre held at<br />
their throats.  Around Cain, poppy petals still floated gently to<br />
the floor from where his sword had appeared.</p>
<p>"Right," said Hyacinth.  With one impressively swift motion he threw the scout and the raccoon off him and stood up.</p>
<p>"This is all getting unnecessary violent," he said.  "Does no-one here wish to talk sensibly about any of this?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Thank you! Yes, that is what I wanted to begin with and those loyal<br />
guards wouldn&#039;t let me..." Ilandra said, exasperation creeping into her<br />
voice. "Violence is not really the ideal way of sorting this out...<br />
let&#039;s sit down and talk and sort out the problem over some tea."</p>
<p>She placed emphasis on the word &#039;tea&#039; letting everyone present that it was a major hint.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain, assuming the threat from the guards to be over, moved across the room to join his fiancÈ.</p>
<p>"Right," said Hyacinth again, gesturing to a table that would<br />
comfortably seat them all.  "Is everyone going to be sensible<br />
about this, or is one still about to be attacked?"  He glared<br />
particularly at the man with the sword, who looked questioningly in<br />
Jebodiah&#039;s direction.</p>
<p>"We sit," said the old man.</p>
<p>"Nyano," said Cain, "your quest is nearly at an end, yet I&#039;m sure what<br />
happens next will be of utmost importance to our House.  Would you<br />
and your father care to join us?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Well if you ask, we can&#039;t really say no can we?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"It wasn&#039;t a command, Nyano," said Cain.  "You can do as you please!"</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Nyano and Serendil took their place next to Cain at the<br />
table.  Before sitting, the Duke pulled on a rope that set bells<br />
ringing in some far-off and possibly disintegrated part of the castle.</p>
<p>"Well then," he said as he took his seat at the head of the table, "I assume your... group all came here with a purpose?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Yes, we did." Ilandra said, fixing the duke with a very feline stare.<br />
"Basically, your people are unhappy with you and so are your<br />
neighbouring lands and we want to know what you plan to do about it."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"What one plans to do about it?  Surely you&#039;ve seen the view from<br />
the window?  What can one do when half one&#039;s land is occupied by<br />
one&#039;s enemies, the other half by one&#039;s allies, and one barely has a<br />
castle let alone an army?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, you could abdicate... I&#039;ll do you a deal, you abdicate and I&#039;ll<br />
let you live on my lands." She said. "Oh and drop that whole &#039;one&#039;<br />
stuff... what&#039;s your name anyway?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Abdicate?  Abdicate?!"  Duke Hyacinth practically exploded.  "I&#039;ve never been so insulted!  <i>Nobody</i> abdicates!  Name me one Duke who ever did!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"One who doesn&#039;t wanna get killed." she said, standing. "You&#039;ve been<br />
offered a free life in a way close to what you&#039;re accustomed to, take<br />
it or leave it... otherwise, it looks like you&#039;re pretty much gonna get<br />
killed."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Now, now.  Did you not wish to talk sensibly about things without resorting to violence, but a few minutes ago?"</p>
<p>He gestured to the doorway, in which stood a servant bearing a teapot and a stack of cups.</p>
<p>"Did you not want tea?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"TEA!!!" she cried, excitedly running over and hugging the Duke then<br />
running to the servant and relieving him of the teapot and a cup which<br />
she took back to the table and sipped at purring loudly. Seeing the<br />
looks the others gave her she poured them a cup each and returned to<br />
her own. "Besides, my hands are pretty much tied... I wouldn&#039;t get away<br />
with killing anybody even if I wanted to..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well then, now you have admitted your threats to be somewhat empty, do<br />
you have any other suggestions, or may one return to governing his<br />
country as best as he is able given the circumstances?"</p>
<p>As if to make the point, a loud crash of stone against stone echoed<br />
around the room, shaking fragments of plaster from the ceiling.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Oh but my friends here can, all I have to do is turn a blind eye or<br />
claim to be here against my will..." she said, looking at the ceiling.<br />
"The real question is, do you want to get out of here alive or not? Cos<br />
the way I see it you could stay behind or come with us... Unless Cain<br />
has any objection?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I suppose not," said Cain.  "Though I have no idea where we&#039;re<br />
supposed to be going when we leave here.  Wandering aimlessly with<br />
a dispossessed Duke could be a bad plan.  Er... Ilandra?  Are<br />

<p>Nyano finally snaps away from his horrid facination with the scene<br />
before him, he turns to his father and gestures subtly at the boomerang<br />
and whispers:</p>
<p>"Dad! The guards!"</p>

<p>In but a moment, the room virtually exploded with activity.</p>
<p><font color="red">Brace yourselves, this post is a la longcat.</font></p>

<p>Hyacinth&#039;s reputation amongst his allies was severely damaged.</p>
<p>Duke Hyacinth just about managed to gasp the word "Guards!" before his screaming continued anew.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Ilandra, the poison finally having taken its hold of her despite her<br />
strength of will, collapsed to the ground.  The shadow faded and<br />
evaporated around her, leaving her body slumped on the ground.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The guards, hearing screams, rushed into the room with sabres drawn.</p>
<p>"What&#039;s going on here?" shouted the taller of the two.  "Who&#039;s<br />
that man screaming?  And why are there two raccoons in here now?"</p>
<p>--</p>
<p><font color="red">An Hero rolls Stamina (3) + Survival (1), difficulty 6: 1 success!</font></p>
<p>At the other side of the table, almost unnoticed, the young man<br />
staggered slightly and grabbed hold of his chair, barely managing to<br />
stay upright.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Cain dropped to Ilandra&#039;s side, and shook her by the shoulders.  "Ilandra!" he shouted.  "Ilandra!"</p>
<p>He stood again in a shower of poppy petals, his sword once more at his side.  He turned, slowly, to face the Duke.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>"Right, son!" said Serendil.  "Stand back.  It&#039;s my duty to<br />
protect you from all these horrible violent people!  PACIFIST<br />
BOOMERANG!!"</p>
<p><font color="red">Serendil rolls Dex (3) + Something-like-Thrown (3) = 6, difficulty 5 + extra opponent = 6.<br />

<p>Serendil flung the boomerang in a wide arc, cutting across the two<br />
guards.  It struck against both their swords with a satisfying<br />
clanging sound, sending both of them flying backwards and sliding ten<br />
feet across the floor.</p>
<p>The raccoon caught the weapon as it returned perfectly to his hand.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Good job Dad! You&#039;re an example to us all, you didn&#039;t even hurt them!"</p>
<p>Nyano turns his eyes on the fallen guards.</p>
<p>"You two should be ashamed of yourself, rushing in here and swinging<br />
weapons about. People might get hurt! Put them away and give up, you&#039;re<br />
seriously outmatched."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"We only came in to see what the screaming was about!" said one of the guards, lifting his head slightly from the floor.</p>
<p>"The man over there in the frock coat, he was screaming.  I think<br />
he&#039;s whimpering now.  Is he some kind of friend of yours?  We<br />
didn&#039;t see him come in..."</p>
<p><font color="red">OC: You&#039;re about as clueless as the guards.<br />
Close inspection of his ring or sword would reveal him to be Duke<br />
Hyacinth, and you remember that the Hyacinths are on the opposite side<br />
of the war to the Poppies - but without that inspection, you don&#039;t<br />
remember who he is or why he&#039;s here.</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano turns to look at the strange pointy man, before responding to the guards.</p>
<p>"I haven&#039;t a clue, he&#039;s no friend of ours. Anyway we have everything<br />
under control here, shouldn&#039;t you be patrolling or something"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"It, er, doesn&#039;t look very under control to me.  There&#039;s people on the floor, and that man over there has his sword drawn!"</p>
<p>"Besides," continued the other guard.  "You can see this castle&#039;s<br />
under attack.  It&#039;s not safe to be here.  If everything truly<br />
is under control, I suggest you leave immediately."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cain was simmering gently.</p>
<p>"You," he said slowly to the semi-coherent Duke.  "You&#039;re responsible for the poisoned tea, aren&#039;t you?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"The tea was poisoned?"</p>
<p>Ignoring the still supine guards, Nyano turned quickly to his father.</p>
<p>"We shouldn&#039;t let the tea servant get away!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"What?" exclaimed the butler.  With a second&#039;s thought, he started<br />
to make a run for the door behind the guards.  For their part,<br />
they began cautiously to get to their feet, still nervous of<br />
rodent-launched projectiles.</p>
<p>Cain raised his sword, slowly but surely, to Duke Hyacinth&#039;s neck.</p>
<p>"What did you put in it?  What was the poison?!"  He paused and lowered his voice.  He&#039;d noticed the ring.</p>
<p>"You&#039;re Hyacinth, aren&#039;t you?  Duke Hyacinth."</p>
<p>The Duke stiffened noticeably, and looked up at Cain.  For the first time, he noticed the ring on Cain&#039;s finger too.</p>
<p>"Duke... No, you&#039;re too young.  I remember...  I don&#039;t remember.  Are you Duke Poppy?"</p>
<p>"Prince," said Cain.  "Well, that would make us on opposite sides,<br />
would it not?  And this would be my sword at your throat."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"PEACE AND LOVE ANKLE ATTACK!" shouted Serendil, flinging the boomerang<br />
and neatly taking out the servant&#039;s ankles.  He fell to the floor<br />
with a painful-sounding thud.</p>
<p>"Well," he said to Nyano.  "At least we didn&#039;t get around to having a cup of tea, eh?"</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>"I believe," said Cain, "that being the case, it would be normal for me<br />
to demand that your join our side or that I kill you.  However,<br />
bearing in mind how many times I recall the Hyacinths <i>switching sides</i> over the past three years, I&#039;m not sure the former is a good idea."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"And don&#039;t you go anywhere until all of this is over!"</p>
<p>Nyano shouts at the butler.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"T&#039; others may &#039;ave lost their mem&#039;ries," said Jebodiah, moving around<br />
behind the Duke and jabbing at him with his cane to make the point,<br />
"bu&#039; Oi &#039;member exac&#039;ly who y&#039;are and what ya&#039;ve done.  Yer<br />
death&#039;d not even begin ta make up fer it."</p>
<p>"One does not-" the Duke began, but a swift crack on the back of his<br />
ankles from Jebodiah brought his neck into contact with Cain&#039;s<br />
sword.  His eyes widened, and he seemed on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright, One... I... I give up.  What do you want from me?"</p>
<p>Jebodiah smiled.</p>
<p>"This."</p>
<p>With one swift motion unexpected of a man of his age, Jebodiah grabbed<br />
the signet ring on Duke Hyacinth&#039;s finger, spun him round so as to pull<br />
the ring off, and pushed him back against Cain&#039;s sword.</p>
<p>Cain stood, mouth agape, as his sword ran with Hyacinth&#039;s blood.</p>
<p>Slowly, inexorably, his smile widening with every step of the motion,<br />
Jebodiah slid Duke Hyacinth&#039;s signet ring onto his right index finger.</p>
<p>Out in the valley, the few Hyacinth flowers that had survived the fires<br />
of war died and shrivelled into blackened stumps.  The ground<br />
shook, even though the shelling had stopped, and the soldiers of the<br />
armies stopped mid-sword swing.  Something was wrong.  Very<br />
wrong.</p>
<p>And all around those who stood in the late Duke&#039;s reception room, the castle started to waver and fade...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"MURDERER!" Shouts Nyano as the castle dissapears around him.</p>
<p>He takes a great big raccoony leap towards Jebodiah trying to grab the finger that has the ring.</p>
<p>"You don&#039;t deserve to become a noble like that!"</p>

<p>Diving across the table, Nyano bowled Jebodiah over and swiped the ring from his finger almost as soon as he had put it on.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano tries to head back the relative safety of his father, but as the<br />
flagstones dissolve beneath his feet he notices their predicament.</p>
<p>Without any idea what else to do, and remembering that he is a proper noble, he puts the ring on.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Nyano slipped the ring onto one of his claws, it somehow managing to<br />
fit despite the biological differences.  For a moment, it felt<br />
strange and tingly.</p>
<p>Then it smashed.</p>
<p>The room flooded with red-tinged light, and in an instant not only were<br />
the walls and floor real again, but the smashed windows and crumbling<br />
stonework was as new.  Poppy-red pennants flew from every pristine<br />
and shining tower, and the repaired encircling wall was hung with Poppy<br />
banners.</p>
<p>In the valley, the stumps of Hyacinth flowers and even the boulders and<br />
scorch marks were scythed away as a wave of poppy flowers spread out<br />
from the castle across the land as far as eyes could see.</p>
<p>The Whites, to a man, turned and fled as they saw and felt that the<br />
land was no longer theirs.  Deep in the castle&#039;s basement, a<br />
strange device shattered and the barrier that once fenced Hyacinth land<br />
was gone.</p>
<p>Ilandra and the old man blinked and opened their eyes, their unconsciousness gone with the effects of the poison.</p>
<p>Days&#039; ride to the south, a strange look crossed Regara&#039;s face.<br />
Not joy, and not resignation, but something.  Something knowing.</p>
<p>Weeks&#039; ride to the north, in a tall and jagged tower like an obsidian<br />
tear cried from heaven, in a room so high all of Fairyland could be<br />
seen, a young man removed a small white token from a board to replace<br />
it with a red one.</p>
<p>Further away, a distance beyond distance, early Spring would never be the same again.</p>
<p>House Hyacinth was no more.</p>
<p>At the centre of it all stood a raccoon, swathed in red light and<br />
swirls of Glamour.  And he knew, just for that moment, that all<br />
was right with the world.</p>
