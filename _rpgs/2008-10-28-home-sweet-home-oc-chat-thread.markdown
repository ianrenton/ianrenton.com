<p><i>This is an out-of-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Behold the Out of Character chat thread.  Anything goes; have fun!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>CURRENT CHARACTER STATUS</p>
<p>Nyano: Ready to play.<br />
Hugh: Ready to play.<br />
Azimov: Ready to play.<br />
Gustaffsen: Ready to play.<br />
Ilandra: Ready to play.<br />
???: Currently waiting for a character concept (elegy_of_flames)</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Burn your eyes with colour!  A shiny list of the characters currently in the game can be found at:</p>
<p><a href="/rpgs/changeling-in-love-and-war/">/rpgs/changeling-in-love-and-war/</a></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Okay, while we wait for the rest of the characters to show up, I&#039;m<br />
starting some prologue threads.  Since they&#039;re just to kill time,<br />
I&#039;m not expecting anything major to happen in them - but feel free to<br />
come up with major stuff if you like!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Would have posted this yeasterday but due to a computer crash I lost the post halfway through. Soz.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>The potatos have a hacker division! Deploy the ice!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The potato slips on the black ice, careers into the wall, and takes 4 damage!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>I&#039;ll be away at Maelstrom<br />
between midday tomorrow and Tuesday night, so no posting from me during<br />
that time.  Similar, I guess, for Racheet and Andy.</p>
<p>Sorry!  And remember to catch some potatoes while I&#039;m gone!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Back now, as are Racheet and Andy.  Postpostpostpostpost!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Azimov</b></p>
<p>Woot! Woot! Woot!</p>
<p>Mayday festival! singing, dancing, costumes and all is rightr with the world for a few hours ^_^.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Okies just to let you know I&#039;ll be away from my computer till thursday<br />
next week due to stuff which you all know cause most of you will be<br />
there with me for some or all of it.  So I guess this is a really<br />
kinda pointless post :D</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Mmmmmmm pointlesspost.</p>
<p>Seconded! :D</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>I don&#039;t see how that is a valid excuse... I don&#039;t use a computer... (joke)</p>
<p>have fun at maelstrom folks!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Right everyone, I&#039;m sorry for the long delay.  Whatever the GM<br />
equivalent of writer&#039;s block is, it hit me hard.  I blame the<br />
exams!  Still, no more exams for me, so the game should continue<br />
at proper pace now!</p>
<p>Nyano hasn&#039;t been played for nearly two months now - much longer and<br />
he&#039;ll be NPCd until such time as Racheet starts to play again.</p>
<p>Domina&#039;s character is still non-existent.  Given her current<br />
situation, that&#039;s quite understandable.  But if you&#039;re reading<br />
this, Domina, you&#039;re still very welcome to play!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Right you &#039;orrible^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H lovely little bunch of slackers =p</p>
<p>Ilandra, Azimov, Nyano, and the Geordie all have things to be doing and<br />
posts to be making.  My apologies to Ilandra for the delay in my<br />
own post, but the other three - it&#039;s your turn!  Gogogogo!</p>
<p>(Please don&#039;t let this game die ;;_;;)</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Aaal reet, aaal reet, keep yor hair on!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Oh great mark, toss the Crossbow out the window why don&#039;t you.<br />
Now i&#039;m gonna have to come up with another method for opening that<br />
door.  I mean months of planning out the window...</p>
<p>*Sound of bass drum going boom boom*</p>
<p>Oh well I&#039;ve got a new one so all is ok :D</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>in case anyone is wondering about house honeysuckle&#039;s neutral status...<br />
the honeysuckle plant has many medicinal qualities so it acts as a<br />
field hospital to anyone who needs shelter...<br />

<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Welcome and welcome back to the game.  Please enjoy yourself, and have as much fun as you can.</p>
<p>Oh and watch out for the Verr¸ckte Armee der Kartoffeln, die um das<br />
Schlo? laufen und versuchen, Wirklichkeit zu zerstˆren, wie wir sie<br />
kennen.</p>
<p>Oh and one final reminder Bitte bet‰tigen nicht die grosse rote Taste. Danke.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>*blink, blink* "Watch out for the crazy army of potatoes that are<br />
running around the castle and seeking to destroy reality as we know<br />
it?" Wow, I wasn&#039;t aware that their goals were that far-reaching....</p>
<p>I imagine Akane will be heading to Chateau Honeysuckle first to<br />
angst...bugger. I didn&#039;t realize when I came up with her that running<br />
off before the war means she&#039;s now going to find out they all died. I<br />
wanted to avoid angst! Avoid, I say!</p>
<p>But when she runs into the potatoes, I&#039;ll be sure to look for signs that their plans include the obliteration of the universe ^^</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Surely that&#039;s why they&#039;ve gone for the weather control device?</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>They could be attempting to artificially induce growing season in<br />
Faerie so as to procure the best meteorological conditions for them to<br />
be fruitful and multiply and found an independent potato nation? :P</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Hah!</p>
<p>They&#039;re a race of potato people created by a knocker.  You think they think that clearly and normally.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Come to think of it, nooo.... But what&#039;s the point of destroying the<br />
world as we know if you&#039;re not around afterwards to laugh maniacally<br />
and poke the ruins with a big stick? :P</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>well... nocker inventions seem to be rather flawed (remember the<br />
watch?) so i&#039;d assume the potatoes wouldn&#039;t actually care if there were<br />
people left behind too much... and besides, you&#039;ll prove useful for<br />
ilandra&#039;s plan!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Hey dude,</p>
<p>Just wondering, is that the end of our thread or shall we carry<br />
on?  If so, do we want to do the telephone conversation? etc</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>I don&#039;t mind, it&#039;s up to you guys.  I was kind of hoping Akane<br />
would get a move on with some prologue, but everyone else&#039;s prologues<br />
are at a convenient ending, so we could, in theory, move on to the<br />
*actual game* and have her join in a bit later.<br />
Or we could draw out your prologue while we wait for her.  Do you have cool stuff in mind?</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>An explanation: Two types of IC threads!</p>
<p>Righty, now we&#039;re into the game proper - not that further<br />
potato-related hijinks are banned, or anything - I&#039;ll explain one thing<br />
in particular that I wanted to do.  Slowness is the death of<br />
online games, so I&#039;m splitting IC threads into two br />
Plot, and Event.</p>
<p>A plot thread will be for one or a few characters who are doing<br />
something quite specific that needs them to post regularly.  These<br />
won&#039;t do anything without the players posting, but since there&#039;ll only<br />
be a small number of players in the thread, this shouldn&#039;t be too much<br />
trouble.</p>
<p>An event thread (like the one that appeared today) is for any character<br />
who feels like being (and can feasibly be) present.  However, to<br />
avoid massive slow-down, these threads will advance <i>even if nobody is posting</i>.<br />
I&#039;ll keep my posts regular and spaced apart to allow characters to do<br />
plenty in between.  However, if you don&#039;t post, your character is<br />
just assumed not to be doing anything interesting.</p>
<p>(Thoughts on this way of doing things are much appreciated!)</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>wow!!!!  there are three honeysuckle bushes outside our<br />
flat...  I hadn&#039;t noticed them up until now, &#039;cos they&#039;ve only<br />
just started blooming and I rarely ever go that way.  That&#039;s so<br />
cool!!!!</p>
<hr />

<p>"Ian: Thread re-org, please don&#039;t post for a few minutes"</p>
<p>Rage against the machine!!!!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>In Soviet Russia, Machine rage against YOU!!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>I get the feeling that I&#039;m waiting for a reply to my threads and Ian&#039;s waiting for a reply on my threads.  IS this true :)</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>I was holding the V-team thread for a bit while everyone else catches<br />
up...  As for the Uber-tuber, I was still wondering what on earth<br />
to do for that thread =p  Do you have any suggestions as to where<br />
the Uber-tuber might go, or what he&#039;s capable of in his super-secret<br />
lair?  I know what he *does*, I just don&#039;t know where or at who<br />
you might want him to do it!</p>

<p>Congratulations everybody, "In Love and War" now officially has more posts than God!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>But fewer than the Royal Mail. Bad luck fairies.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>meh, could be worse</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall typed:</b>But fewer than the Royal Mail. Bad luck fairies.<br />
Yeah, but at least none of the Changeling players have gone on strike yet =p</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Right, we *finally* have an updated V-Team thread.  Sorry for the<br />
epic delay, I&#039;ve just had no ideas for the thread at all until now =S</p>
<p>At last everyone is on the same day as each other, which probably means<br />
intense pestering is going to put Ilandra and Nyano a day ahead *again*<br />
now, but hey.</p>
<p>Also, was bored the other day so there&#039;s a new info page up:  <a href="/rpgs/in-love-and-war/fairylands-tech-level">Fairyland&#039;s Tech Level</a></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Well, I wouldn&#039;t nag if my attention span hadn&#039;t significantly<br />
shortened as a side-effect of my mental illness and the drugs I take<br />
for said mental illness...</p>
<p>Least now we know that depression gives people insanely short attention spans so I have a good excuse for it...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Does this mean I turn into an ordinary Racoon upon arriving on earth, until we convince people otherwise?</p>
<p>That sounds a bit crap...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>That one&#039;s going to get complicated.  I can&#039;t really see it<br />
working that Nyano&#039;s personality gets scrubbed - he&#039;d still think like<br />
he always has.  But since the humans will think of him as a normal<br />
raccoon, doing non-raccoony things (like talking) will require<br />
overcoming their banality.</p>
<p>Sneak off and leave raccoony post-it notes for people? =p</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>They&#039;d be in French, I remember clarifying that he doesn&#039;t speak<br />
english during character gen. That would be strange and awesome.</p>
<p>Random French post it notes. The thing is, he&#039;d have to procure himself a sword like thing from somewhere and maybe a hat.</p>
<p>I&#039;m thinking maybe a fireplace poker and a colander with a feather in<br />
it. They&#039;d have to take me seriously if I had a sword and a hat! And<br />
when they do, I can speak French at them!</p>

<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>There!  Are we happy now?!?</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p><b>Saledenre typed:</b>There!  Are we happy now?!?<br />
Are we?  I don&#039;t know.  I am!</p>
<p>I think there&#039;s been more posts tonight than in the last month =p</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Oh I&#039;m never happy...</p>
<p>But thanks for the postage and sorry if i&#039;ve upset you...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>That&#039;s ok - I&#039;m sorry about being snappy; you just managed to catch me<br />
at a bad time (long, highly stressful week at work ending on a day<br />
where I didn&#039;t finish &#039;til just before 7pm), although that&#039;s no excuse,<br />
really, for me getting angry at you.</p>
<p>Please remember, though, that I can&#039;t whittle stuff off for Saledenre<br />
at the drop of a hat; I prefer to write stuff I&#039;m happy with and have<br />
thought through rather than just writing stuff for the sake of writing<br />
it.  It was a lucky thing that I&#039;d been considering what to write<br />
for that post for a few days.  It&#039;s just the way I write, hon, and<br />
I ask that you please respect that.</p>
<p>I will, of course, try to write as often as I can but a lot of the time<br />
I&#039;m so tired out by work that I find it difficult to formulate stuff<br />
and type it up - I mean, I haven&#039;t been able to write my own stuff for<br />
_months_ even though I have all the ideas in my head.</p>

<p>A fit of boredom hit me, and I decided to word-count the entire<br />
game.  We&#039;ve just passed the 1400 post mark, and have a total of<br />
almost 180,000 words of IC text.  That&#039;s 3.6 times long enough to<br />
be a standard novel.</p>
<p>It&#039;s also, incidentally, nearly a third the length of War and<br />
Peace.  Which, considering the larger volume spans eight years,<br />
and we&#039;re on day 4, is not bad going at all.</p>
