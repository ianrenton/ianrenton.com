Gavil, Ezekiel and Esqui need their levelups.

&nbsp;

Run time: 2h (how?!)

&nbsp;

IN THE THRONE ROOM

&nbsp;

Lord Granite has stepped back through the portal to his home, goading the characters while doing so. They now stand in his empty throne room, deciding how to proceed.

As they talk, the wall of fire that comprises the portal starts to flicker slightly, feeling a little less hot.

Keys on throne, open doors to treasure rooms &amp; wizard's chamber by touching the wall

After a few more minutes, Ailsa and Arken will arrive, noting that the lava pits seem to be cooling and that the Forestborn army is on its way. They will warn the characters of the dangers that await through the portal, but that they are survivable. A&amp;A will accompany characters if desired. Portal flickers more, dying out slowly. Last chance?

If the characters decide not to go through:

Storage rooms, equipment room for engineers etc.

&nbsp;

BACK AT THE FORESTBORN ENCLAVE

&nbsp;

Information relayed to the Queen. Queen worries that Granite may return with a greater army. Can the portal be re-opened from their side? Probably, though if the lava powered it then they would have to restart the pumps. Go back and break the pumps, waiting for the army?

End session.
