<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>It was approaching dawn by the time Nyano, spurred on by thoughts of<br />
his father to speeds unexpected of a raccoon, made it to the border<br />
between Poppy and Hyacinth lands.  At the crest of the hill that<br />
marked the boundary, two soldiers sat and drifted in and out of<br />
consciousness.  One was making a good show of keeping an eye on<br />
the Hyacinth side of the border, whilst the other idly poked at the<br />
smouldering embers of their fire.  Next to them, two tents from<br />
which copious snoring was emanating and the half-constructed shell of a<br />
watchtower, a project that looked to have been abandoned with the<br />
failing light the previous evening.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Taking stock of the situation, and remembering that he was a Racoon of<br />
stature in the military community, Nyano puffed out his chest, held his<br />
spear high and marched out into the camp.</p>
<p>He walked boldly up to the soldier by the fire and saluted smartly.</p>
<p>"What news from the border Jenkins?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The soldier looked around, startled.  It took a good few panicked<br />
back-and-forth flicks of his eyes before he realised that it was the<br />
raccoon that was speaking, and another few seconds to realise that the<br />
small squeaky-voiced creature was actually somebody he knew.</p>
<p>Once he did, however, he sprung to his feet and saluted.</p>
<p>"&#039;Morning, sir!" said Jenkins, standing to attention.  "Since we<br />
began the reconstruction of the tower yesterday evening, sir, only one<br />
person has passed us - Akane, of House Honeysuckle, shortly after we<br />
arrived ourselves.  Not seen hide nor hair of another since then,<br />
sir!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Very Good! Carry on" Nyano responded in his best general voice.</p>
<p>"I have business over the border, make sure you keep everything ship shape whilst I&#039;m gone"</p>
<p>With that the little raccoon continued on his way, striding purposefully towards the border.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Very good, sir!" said the soldier, saluting Nyano even as he turned away and headed for the border.</p>
<p>As he approached where he knew the dividing line between Poppy and<br />
Hyacinth lands to be, his fur prickled slightly, just before...</p>
<p>WHAM!</p>
<p>Something invisible and painful sent Nyano reeling.  After a few<br />
dazed moments, the young raccoon found himself on the Hyacinth side of<br />
the border, and unharmed besides a strange almost-numb feeling in his<br />
legs and a pounding headache.</p>
<p>Looking back at the Poppy side, he saw nothing out of the ordinary that<br />
could have caused the stunning pain - just, a way away at the top of<br />
the hill, the soldiers carrying on their business as if they had not<br />
noticed.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Clutching his head in an attempt to stop the spinning stars, Nyano turns to the guards and shouts</p>
<p>"Soldiers, get over here right now."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Y... yes sir!" shouted Jenkins, standing and saluting.  He kicked<br />
his less active fireside companion in the shins as encouragement, and<br />
the two of them rushed over.  Inside the tent, a series of muffled<br />
and disgruntled voices hastened to obeying Nyano&#039;s command whilst<br />
bemoaning their lack of sleep.</p>
<p>Jenkins and the other soldier approached and stood to attention at a<br />
respectful distance, in a spot that Nyano guessed to be a mere foot<br />
short of the border.  Whatever barrier it was that seemed to<br />
protect the border had no clues to indicate its presence.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Facing the men, Nyano began to march up and down, before addressing<br />
them in his best drill sergeant squeak. He narrowed his eyes at them as<br />
well for good measure.</p>
<p>"How did you not know that there was a magical barrier 20 feet from your camp?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Sir, we were ordered not to enter Hyacinth land, sir!" replied the more organised of the two.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Very good soldier." Nyano looks apologetic.</p>
<p>"Now I&#039;m ordering you to send a messenger back to castle poppy and tell<br />
them that there&#039;s some kind of barrier around Hyacynth lands. It makes<br />
you pass out and your head ache when you try to come in."</p>
<p>Nyano thinks for a second.</p>
<p>"Wait a moment, I&#039;m going to see if I can get out again"</p>
<p>Then tries to step back over the barrier into Poppy lands.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Nyano stepped forwards.</p>
<p>The wind gusted ever so slightly, making ripples in the grass.</p>
<p>He took another raccoon-step forwards, putting him close enough to the<br />
soldiers that he had to crane his neck up to look them in the<br />
eye.  By now he was sure he was over the border, but nothing<br />
untoward had happened.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Well that wasn&#039;t so bad, now&#039;s the hard part."</p>
<p>He looks back at the border, closes his eyes tightly against the pain and sprints back over it.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>WHAM.</p>
<p>Having braced for impact, Nyano stayed on his feet - but only<br />
just.  He swayed violently as if knocked sideways, and the world<br />
started hurting and spinning with renewed vigour.</p>
<p>"Sir!" shouted one of the guards as he stepped forwards to aid the raccoon.  He too, stepped through the barrier.</p>
<p>WHAM.</p>
<p>Though there was no sound, the force of the barrier coming into effect<br />
was nonetheless audible to Nyano&#039;s migraine.  The soldier sprawled<br />
backwards and lay still on the ground, his ears slowly trickling blood,<br />
whilst his junior looked back and forth between him and Nyano in<br />
terrified confusion.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looks quickly up at the still standing soldier</p>
<p>"Stay where you are. I am ordering you not to come over the border under any circumstances."</p>
<p>Then he runs quickly over to the stricken man and does his best to check if he&#039;s still alive.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The fallen man lay still; not breathing.  It didn&#039;t look good.</p>
<p>Beside them, the still-conscious soldier was fretting.</p>
<p>"S... Sir?  What&#039;s going on?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"It looks like there is a barrier here to kill Fae going into hyacynth<br />
lands. I guess whoever made it wasn&#039;t good enough to properly hurt<br />
Nobles."</p>
<p>Nyano does his best to carry the not-alive soldier over the border.</p>
<p>Once he&#039;s certain that they are well away from the pain field, and that<br />
the soldier  isn&#039;t going to get back up, he turns to the still<br />
living soldier.</p>
<p>"Do you have a shovel?"</p>
<p>and with that, he starts to cry. Great big raccoon sobs shake through<br />
his little body, and he curls up into a dejected heap next to the body.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>With haste the soldiers set about burying their comrade, though the<br />
shock at the suddenness of his death was still very much apparent on<br />
their faces. A deeply ingrained sense of respect for their superior was<br />
the only thing stopping them taking a break from digging to give the<br />
tiny raccoon a great big hug.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Eventually Nyano pulls himself back together.</p>
<p>He orders the men to send a full report back to the castle, and it is a<br />
very dejected raccoon that continues on his trek towards castle<br />
Hyacinth.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Nyano cut across from the main path into Hyacinth lands from the<br />
border, taking advantage of his size to head more directly toward the<br />
castle than most traffic would be able.</p>
<p>The morning passed slowly, the twin emotions of hope of finding his<br />
father and sadness at his soldier&#039;s death mixing in his mind and<br />
dragging out the travelling time to almost unbearably long.</p>
<p>It was only a clicking noise and heavy footfalls ahead of him that<br />
disturbed his reverie.  He stopped, keeping close to the<br />
ground.  It sounded like a group of people ahead - and a horse,<br />
but only one.  Something didn&#039;t quite fit.  Far too few<br />
faeries for an army unit, but no scout patrol would have a horse in<br />
tow...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>The wilderness surroundings combined with Nyano&#039;s own strange mood combined to make his natural instincts kick in.</p>
<p>He quickly climbed up a nearby tree in the path of the oncoming group.<br />
Then he made his way forward along a branch so he was hanging out above<br />
the pathway.</p>
<p>Ears swept back along his skull, and with his sharp raccoon teeth showing Nyano waiting for the party to come into view.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Off to one side of the path, a hundred yards or so ahead of the<br />
approaching footsteps, a rustling sound preceded the brief appearance<br />
of a man&#039;s head from the bushes.  He sported a green bandanna into<br />
which leaves had been haphazardly stuck, and his face was covered with<br />
green and brown.  He glanced around, then disappeared and rustled<br />
off into the foliage.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as he had gone, the cause of the footsteps appeared over<br />
a slight rise in the ground along the road, still sixty yards or so<br />
from Nyano&#039;s branch.</p>
<p>First came a young man sporting a spiky hairdo and an extravagant array<br />
of weaponry, walking alongside a rather frail-looking old man with a<br />
walking stick.</p>
<p>Ten yards or so behind them, another young man with a suspicious resemblance to...  No, it actually <i>was</i><br />
Prince Cain!  Travelling with that cat girl who used to hang<br />
around the castle, and what was almost certainly a Poppy war horse...</p>
