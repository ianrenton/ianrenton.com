<p>Ah, after such a long time on the road, it&#039;s going to be great to get<br />
back to the civilised life of your own kitchen; your own home.  Or<br />
so you&#039;d have thought.</p>
<p>Problem is, the castle&#039;s been more-or-less abandoned for two<br />
years.  The kitchens - your kitchens - have been used only by<br />
soldiers since you left, and soldiers aren&#039;t known for their exquisite<br />
culinary tastes.  Or for their love of washing up.</p>
<p>The sight that greets you isn&#039;t a pleasant one.  The larder is all<br />
but bare, and the only thing vaguely organic in the whole place is<br />
whatever it is that&#039;s growing in the sink.  Probably wise not to<br />
investigate too closely.</p>
<p>The kitchen staff pile into the room behind you, and look around the place as if mirroring your dismay.</p>
<p>Just as they are about to begin the long, slow process of restoring the<br />
kitchen to an approximation of its former glory, a servant bustles in.</p>
<p>"Her highness demands a five-course banquet, in celebration of our return.  For the whole castle.  Tonight."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>For one brief instant, he could feel the panic creeping through the<br />
back of his head. The sickening sensation that not only was he going to<br />
fail, someone was going to be really really pissed off about it. And<br />
then it was gone, swept away by the rush of adrenaline and the sheer<br />
greatness of his wonderous glory.</p>
<p>He span to face the staff, flying hair framing his head for a moment in<br />
a tangled halo of dirty brown. At the same time, he swept his hands up<br />
into an almighty clap, drawing the attention of everyone in the room.<br />
Then, the orders poured forth with the irresistable force of a raging<br />
river, bursting its banks and flooding the room with a cacophany of<br />
furious organisation.</p>
<p>"The gaggle over in that corner! I want an inventory of all the<br />
implements we&#039;ve got that&#039;s still servicable and then I want them<br />
sparkling! If I can&#039;t see my face in every single pot in the next hour,<br />
the main dish will be Roast Fae!"</p>
<p>"You&#039;re the messenger. Run as fast as those silly skinny little legs of<br />
yours&#039;ll take you, find the master of the hunt and politely - AND I<br />
MEAN POLITELY - ask him if he could spare us a moment."</p>
<p>"You three, over there! Grab a container and get as much of that green stuff you can scrape off the sink."</p>
<p>"ChefHat! Grab the slightly squashy tomato, half-eaten jar of<br />
mayonnaise and pair of smoked kippers from the back of the larder. I<br />
don&#039;t care if it looks empty, they&#039;ll be there. They&#039;re always there."</p>
<p>"As for the rest of you, the floor needs mopping, the ovens need<br />
scrubbing, the tables need ... well, burning from the look of it. But<br />
you&#039;ll have to do the best you can with a cloth and elbow grease."</p>
<p>"Well don&#039;t just stand there lollygagging, Get A Move On!!"</p>
<p>He watched for a moment, to make sure they all set to with the<br />
efficiency, speed and blind terror of a properly motivated kitchen<br />
staff and then murmered to himself.</p>
<p>"There&#039;ll be a banquet tonight, oh yes. Even if everything has to be done a la francais..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The assistant chefs glance at each other, sharing an expression halfway between guilt and foreboding.</p>
<p>"A la Francais.  Oh dear..."</p>
<p>True to form, though, the slightly squashy tomato, the half-eaten jar<br />
of mayonnaise and the pair of smoked kippers are produced from the<br />
cupboards.  Actually, when one looks harder, there&#039;s a fair bit<br />
more besides in there.  Food normally so inedible that the<br />
observer&#039;s eyes barely register their presence, but they&#039;re there.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes, the master of the hunt shows up, in full regalia<br />
minus the horse.  A whinny from the corridor suggests that the<br />
only reason he is not currently mounted may be the height of the<br />
kitchen door.  Certainly his dogs are busying themselves worrying<br />
the kitchen staff.</p>
<p>"What ho, Hugh!" the man booms.  "What can I do you for?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Dashing to the door, Hugh&#039;s features effervesce from his<br />
motivating-the-underlings scowl to his far more amiable I-need-a-favour<br />
grin.</p>
<p>"What ho! What ho! How&#039;s the old lady? Fine, splendid.</p>
<p>Listen old chap, I&#039;m in a bit of a spot - the grand D. wants the full<br />
five courses this evening and the cupboards are gaping. How much of the<br />
dead animalflesh can you lay on in the next few hours?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m sure we can come up with something for you, good man!  I&#039;ll<br />
be back here with a hundred dead and dying deer faster than you can say<br />
&#039;awful alliteration&#039;!  Tally ho!"</p>
<p>With that the man leaves the room at speed, eager to get back to the hunts that he&#039;d not been able to go on for so long.</p>
<p>"Awful alliter-" starts one of the servants with a wide grin on his<br />
face as the huntsman disappears down the corridor, but his facetious<br />
remark ends only in a scream.  As soon as his outburst subsides,<br />
he follows it up sharply with a "What the hell is that!?"</p>
<p>As you look across at him, you can see what looks remarkably like<br />
a...  A potato.  Scampering across the kitchen floor.<br />
On four tiny little legs.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b><br />
"By gum! A wild haggis! Quick, fetch my haggis-net!"</p>
<p>Observing the speed at which the thing is retreating, Hugh grabs the mans arm.</p>
<p>"Scratch that, grab the long handled tongs and follow me!"</p>
<p>And, demonstrating quite a burst of acceleration, he sets one hoof in<br />
front of the other and pursues the potato, around the ovens, kicking<br />
the great buckets of water and soap that are too bulky to get out of<br />
the way quickly all over the floor. The potato seems to have realise<br />
it&#039;s being chased and starts taking evasive action, weaving from side<br />
to side and then making a break under one of the large tables currently<br />
being used as a holding place for the inroads being made into the<br />
filthy dishes.</p>
<p>Without pause, Hugh vaults up, sending crockery flying to all corners<br />
of the room as he thumps across the table, landing on the other side<br />
just behind the potato. Whereupon the kitchen hands who&#039;d neatly<br />
positioned themselves for just this oppurtunity throw themselves down<br />
in an attempt to subdue the starchy savage. Which is, of course, far<br />
too nimble for them. Jumping up on their prone bodies, pausing only to<br />
deliver a few hefty kicks, it hurls itself across onto the marble<br />
preparation surfaces and, little legs flailing on the smooth newly<br />
polished surface, dives straight into the sinkfull of washing up.</p>
<p>Followed, a moment later, by Hugh shouting "Chocks Away!" at the top of<br />
his voice, sending a great spray of grey water, foamy suds and<br />
half-cleaned pots over the staff unfortunate enough to be standing<br />
nearby. The remainder of the contents of the sink soon follow as Hugh<br />
turfs them out in an attempt to find the wayward &#039;tater, all the while<br />
demanding his net. Eventually, one of the kitchen staff develops enough<br />
bravery to point out that the potato was clinging to the giant iron Wok<br />
that vigorously knocked out poor Ecclestone and is currently making its<br />
way out of the kitchen door.</p>
<p>Whereupon Hugh, long hair clumped into thick wet pseudodreadlocks, deep<br />
emerald shirt turned a vile swamp green, blinking the dishwater from<br />
his eyes charged from the room with a yell.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>With Hugh&#039;s yell, the huntsman&#039;s bugle call and a resounding cry of<br />
"follow that vegetable!" from the kitchen staff, the charge begins.</p>
<p>The potato twists and turned through corridor after corridor, bouncing<br />
between the floor and the walls is its skinny legs misjudge the turns<br />
and kicking up dust from the as yet uncleaned castle floors.</p>
<p>As it descends the stairs towards the back of the castle, tripping up<br />
two servants on the way, it takes a sharp right turn and dashes through<br />
the extensive laundry room.  The Charge of the Chef Brigade<br />
follows hot on its tail, and even hotter now they race through a room<br />
full almost entirely of steam.</p>
<p>Almost entirely.  As they burst out of the door on the other side<br />
of the landry, it&#039;s not just steam that they are accompanied by - Hugh<br />
now seems to be sporting some kind of silk robe on his head, the<br />
huntsman has somehow acquired a nightgown, and no less than three<br />
kitchen servants appear to be entangled in a pair of the Duchess&#039;<br />
bloomers.</p>
<p>Still the charge continues, with optional Benny Hill theme tune, until<br />
the potato leaps for a drainpipe in the wall.  The huntsman leaps<br />
after it, but unused to wearing a nightgown he slips and collides<br />
head-on with the wall.</p>
<p>The clanking noises from the drainpipe disappear up into the roof.</p>
<p>"You there," Hugh exclaims to attract a servant&#039;s attention.  "Where does that pipe go?"</p>
<p>"Upstairs, he replies.  One of the storage rooms I think!  Follow me!"</p>
<p>And with that, the charge is moving once more.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Up the stairs, through what felt like several miles of gaily decorated<br />
corridors and then straight through the ball room, picking up all the<br />
more easily distracted nobility (which&#039;d be all of it) on the way, then<br />
up the next set of stairs, down more miles of even brighter decorations<br />
and then into the myriad corridors that lead to the various storage<br />
rooms.</p>
<p>After a brief attempt at organisation, foiled again and again by the<br />
giggling nobles, Hugh simply starts picking doors at random, wrenching<br />
them open and searching the rooms beyond.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As Hugh, leading the now army-like mob of faerie nobles and servants,<br />
bursts though the door to one particular bedroom in the north-western<br />
tower, his eyes light up.  There it is!  Got you n...</p>
<p>...or not.</p>
<p>The potato has somehow affixed the other end of the rope that it holds<br />
in its hand onto the top of the tower, and as the mob watches it winks<br />
and jumps.</p>
<p>"Geronimoooooooo!"</p>
<p>Hugh rushes to the window in time to see the potato arc through the air<br />
and jump from its rope to land inside a window on the tower<br />
opposite.  As soon as it disappears, to more potatoes appear from<br />
that window, and point and aim what look an awful lot like potato-sized<br />
crossbows...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Well! If it was a war they wanted, no man, mouse nor tubery vegetable would find a Fearnley-Whittingstall wanting.</p>
<p>He turned to the mob and bellowed for silence until all that could be<br />
heard was the pepper of tiny crossbow-bolts on the stonework outside.<br />
Then, with a cold hard look at his "troops", he has another go at<br />
organising them. Picking the noble of greatest ... stature, he declares<br />
him captain of the Official Kitchen Archery platoon, assigns a bunch of<br />
random kitchen staff to him and tells them to keep a constant withering<br />
fire up.</p>
<p>He then turns to the rest of the men.</p>
<p>"All right men, I won&#039;t lie to you. The potatos have the high ground and superior weaponry. But we have grit, guts and ... "</p>
<p>Seizing the net from the poor out of breath kitchenhand he brandishes it.</p>
<p>"The fabled potato net of Eeee!</p>
<p>CHAAAAAAAAAAARGE!"</p>
<p>And setting deed to word, he hurled himself out of the room, back down<br />
the stairs and outside, heading at great speed for the tower.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Hugh and his lynch mob hurtle out of the room, Hugh and his potato net<br />
now firmly in the lead.  For some inexplicable reason, many of the<br />
rest of the mob aren&#039;t quite so keen on leading the charge against an<br />
enemy with crossbows.</p>
<p>Down three flights of stairs, across a courtyard, around or in some<br />
cases over a pond and through the stables, the group arive at the base<br />
of the tower that the potato was last seen disappearing into.</p>
<p>It seems locked, and has a message scrawled in chalk on the door:</p>
<p>"TATERS ONLIE"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"HAAAAAAALT! Regroup men!"</p>
<p>*ahem*</p>
<p>"... and ladies."</p>
<p>There they stand at the bottom of the tower for a moment, waiting for<br />
their artillery support to begin. Precisely one and a half polite<br />
comments about the weather later, a head sticks itself out of the<br />
upstairs storeroom they&#039;d come from and bellows down at the courtyard<br />
in perfect geordie.</p>
<p>"D&#039;ye like, want us to start shelling now?"</p>
<p>"Fire at will!"</p>
<p>A barrage of small white-brown objects arcs up and out from the window,<br />
fired from small makeshift catapults. They seem to hang in the air for<br />
a moment and then drop. Directly on top of the army, which scatter<br />
efficiently across the courtyard, diving for whateve cover they can<br />
find. The objects smash onto the hard cobbles, breaking and covering<br />
the ground in raw egg.</p>
<p>"Yee sackless fools! Aim fre the winda or you&#039;ll be eaten dandruff salad the neet, dyer knaa what Ah mean liek?"</p>
<p>The army pulls itself back together as another volley of eggs flies<br />
over the courtyard to smash against the tower window as Hugh sorts out<br />
the next stage of the plan.</p>
<p>"You, you, you and ... look here, this is just ridiculous. I can&#039;t just<br />
go around calling everyone &#039;you&#039; all the time, it&#039;s impolite. Does<br />
anyone have any nametags?"</p>
<p>The universal law of army politick, which had been quietly trimming its<br />
toenails in a bathtub somewhere in Wiltshire sprang into action and<br />
spawned one of the annoying officious little oiks that inhabit<br />
Requisitons in the quartermasters department in all military<br />
organisations who immediately begins jumping up and down, waving a roll<br />
of sticky labels and a black marker pen. Given the go-ahead and a<br />
promotion to Lance Corporal (to make up for the expense), he zips<br />
through the crowd like a dose of hot salts, slapping name tags on<br />
everyone with little regard for calligraphy, accuracy or (as his<br />
glowing red face attests) decency. Finally, he slaps a "Hair<br />
Commandment" on Hugh and a "L.C. Kieth" on himself.</p>
<p>And Hugh gets down to business!</p>
<p>"Right, private Laurel is it? And you, sergeant Hardy, I want you two<br />
to find a ladder long enough to reach that window from somewhere."</p>
<p><i>"&#039;Ere, &#039;ow comes I&#039;m a private and you&#039;re a sergeant? T&#039;ain&#039;t fair!"</i></p>
<p>"It&#039;ll probably be heavy, Corporal Chaplin, you&#039;d best help them carry it. Now, the rest of you..."</p>
<p><i>"Clearly it&#039;s my superior bearing Stanley."</i></p>
<p>"... we&#039;re going to need three barrels of lye, a feather duster, the collected works of Wordsworth ... No, better make that ..."</p>
<p><i>"Well, I&#039;m not saluting you!"</i></p>
<p>"Thomas Hardy, a pack of cub scouts and a well-plucked grouse. Then, what we&#039;ll do is..."</p>
<p>Hugh outlines his plan to the army, still oblivious to the whispered<br />
argument. Meanwhile, a short squat figure with "Sergeant" written all<br />
over his face (Kieth got carried away) takes a small squad of men,<br />
grabs a decorative statue from the corner of the courtyard and, while<br />
eggs continue to rain down on and around the window, proceeds to start<br />
battering the door down.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Brace!" came the urgent cry from inside the tower, and almost<br />
immediately hundreds of tiny thuds echoed out from the other side of<br />
the door.  Commands continued to be shouted, but became more and<br />
more muffled over time - as did the thumps.</p>
<p>Eventually all sounds seemed to stop.  The door wouldn&#039;t budge an<br />
inch.  No more potatoes were visible though the windows either,<br />
and slowly the sulphurous artillery barrage ceased.</p>
<p>There was a pause of a few seconds where everyone was silent.</p>
<p>And then, with a grating noise of stone against stone, the top floor of<br />
the tower started inexorably to... open.  The thick stone walls<br />
peeled outwards like banana skins, until at last they came to rest<br />
pointing downwards and slightly out.  The top floor of the tower<br />
now stood open to the sky, and everyone below could see what the room<br />
contained.  Not that anyone knew what the hell it was, anyway.</p>
<p>It looked oddly like a flagpole was hula dancing, with undertones of weird gribbliness and overtones of very, very weird...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>As one the fairies look up at the revolving device, then each other.<br />
Minds racing, they all reach the same conclusion simultaneously.</p>
<p>"GUSTAFFSON!"</p>
<p>And it&#039;s every fae for themself. The courtyard empties in a flurry of<br />
panicked scrambling, furious elbowing and, as Laurel and Hardy had just<br />
managed to track down a ladder, stop-motion slapstick.</p>
<p>Hugh, rubbing his head, finds a random regimental sergeant major and<br />
sends them up to the artillery division with instructions to throw<br />
everything they have at the strange wobbly thing on top of the tower.<br />
He scampers back after a short wait to relay the message "Reet yee are<br />
sir, Aa&#039;ve just the thing."</p>
<p>And then, what appears from the ground to be a large ostrich egg with<br />
small mdf fins is launched from the window, flying straight and true to<br />
smash onto the device, coating it in a thick layer of ostrich-goo.</p>
