<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Deep in the bowels of Castle Poppy, inexplicable things steamed and<br />
even less sensible things bleeped and flickered as Schrodinger and<br />
Heisenberg rushed around, setting up the laboratory as best they<br />
could.  In the centre of this eccentric dance of activity and<br />
probability, Gustafssen stood serenely flicking the feather from side<br />
to side in his hand.</p>
<p>The feather shone with a purple light that nearly - but not quite -<br />
reflected its actual colour, and it felt cool to the touch.  It<br />
also felt unnaturally tingly, a good sign that this feather came not<br />
from a bird but from a dream.</p>
<p>With several whirrs and a worryingly loud clunk, a gigantic magnifying<br />
glass lowered itself across one of the scientist&#039;s many desks, light<br />
flashing back and forth inside it, ready to carry out Gustafssen&#039;s own<br />
unique brand of scientific investigation.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Cassually the Fae scientist walked over to the magnifying glass and<br />
placed the feather beneath it, before casually taking a twenty pence<br />
piece from his pocket and placing it in the slot fixed into the side of<br />
the table.  Instantly deep within the bowels of the table a timer<br />
mechanism started to run and the image within the glass sharpened<br />
drastically and slowly began to zoom in on the feather.  On the<br />
other side of the laboratory images and print outs began to be printed<br />
out and high above in the castle all the magical mirrors began spewing<br />
the latest reports from the London stock exchange.  When finally<br />
the glass reached almost full zoom Gustafssen placed several leaf<br />
shaped filters over the lens and the twists and twirls of the glamour<br />
that made up the very substance of the dream that the feather came into<br />
view.</p>
<p>It was at this moment in time that the timer mechanism chose to click<br />
to a stop and the view before him was eclipsed by a the image of a<br />
small card bearing the words &#8216;Thank you for your patronage.  We<br />
hope you have enjoyed your stay in sunny Graves End.&#8217;  Before<br />
shutting down completely.  One muffled word rang out through the<br />
laboratory as pockets were patted down and several fluff covered boiled<br />
sweets were unearthed before another coin was located. &#8220;Schei?e.&#8221;<br />
Finally Gustafssen was staring at the finest points of glamour once<br />
more with the intensity of one who has spent many years searching for<br />
the true formula for the greatest Egg Mayonnaise and salad sandwich.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Deeper and deeper down through the layers of imagining, beyond the<br />
black and beyond the purple, lie tendrils of colour and of suggestion.</p>

<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Quietly Gustafssen watched the read outs in front of him, occasionally<br />
feeding coins into the slot.  Once when the coin supply ran out he<br />
absentmindedly emptied the machines coin back and started the process<br />
all over again.  Finally he reached for the Sonic<br />

asparagus shaped metal spears around the feather.</p>

<p>Tendrils of resonant sound echo out from the feather, coruscate along<br />
the asparagus, and dissolve themselves into flickering<br />
half-word-half-symbol creations along the rim of the magnifying glass.</p>

<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>As the words swirled around the edges of the lens a deep thoughtful<br />
expression crossed the great fae&#8217;s face.  Upon seeing his<br />
expression Schrodinger and Heisenberg hastened their activities, they<br />
knew what that face meant.  Often it meant explosions, smoke and a<br />
large consignment of mixed vegetable paste to the kitchens.<br />
Nanoseconds stretched out to milliseconds, milliseconds to seconds and<br />
finally seconds into minutes.  This was unheard of, that<br />
Gustafssen should stand and think for a ten whole minutes.  It<br />
brought terror into the lab fairies hearts and awe into their minds,<br />
what would the output of such a long silence be?  Would it contain<br />
vegetable matter?  Most certainly.  Would it destroy the<br />
world?  Who knows, but it had happened before.  Was it<br />
safe?  They damned well hoped so.</p>
<p>And then as if the intervening minutes hadn&#8217;t occurred Gustafssen was<br />
heading towards the potato pens with a light bounce in his step.<br />
Carefully he selected a potato that seemed to be lagging behind all the<br />
others as they roamed around their enclosure.  It just didn&#8217;t seem<br />
to have the energy of the others, seeming to want to curl up in a<br />
corner instead of marauding around stomping and occasionally breaking<br />
out into a scuffle like the rest of its cohort.  After carefully<br />
extracting the vegetable, and shaking off the few who tried to bite him<br />
in some way, he took the potato to his work bench and strapped it into<br />
a small potato sized metal frame chair.  This done he took what<br />
looked like a small colander with multicoloured wires streaming from it<br />
the other end of which attached to the feather, and placed it gently on<br />
the potatoes head before carefully buckling a strap under an area that<br />
could only be called the potatoes chin by the extremist of definitions<br />
of the word.  Finally everything was in readiness for the<br />
experiment.  All that was left was for him to throw the<br />
switch.  Which he did...</p>
<p>&#8230; the switch sailed across the room in a perfectly calculated arch,<br />
narrowly missing the stuffed alligator and oddly glowing baubles that<br />
hung from the ceiling, before landing with a thud on the power<br />
button.  And suddenly the room was full of lighting flashing<br />
about, smoke pouring out of vents in the walls, water flowing freely up<br />
the walls.  Throughout the castle lamp lights and candle flames<br />
alight flashed on and off.  Hundred of giant red arrows popped out<br />
of the walls and gleefully told all who could hear that in no uncertain<br />
terms they were &#8216;Here!&#8217;  Dust poured from the stone work undoing<br />
hours of work by the servants.  People&#8217;s hair crackled with static<br />
electricity and cats suddenly became as attractive to buttered toast as<br />
red wine is to freshly laid white carpets.  Those unfortunate few<br />
that had the toast fix to their back spent many unhappy minutes<br />
spinning in mid air as the world sort to calculate which was more<br />
likely to hit the ground first Cats feet or toast butter side down.</p>
<p>Carefully Gustafssen lifted the potato from its chair and laid it into<br />
a small bed, complete with nightstand, glass of water and night cap,<br />
tucked it in and placed it under the giant lens in place of the<br />
feather.  &#8220;To sleep Perchance to dream meine s¸sse<br />

<p>As the potato fell dreamily into sleep, the vision of its dream flickered and appeared in the centre of Gustafssen&#039;s lab.</p>
<p>It began, as so many do, with flight.  Flight, low and fast,<br />
across the land of faerie.  Castle Poppy was a mere flicker on the<br />
journey, but recognisable nonetheless, before the potato flew far out<br />
west toward the very centre of fairyland.</p>
<p>The flight slowed as it approached the Queen&#039;s Castle - a vast towering<br />
precipice of white ice and blue fire that jutted up out of the<br />
landscape like a crystal dart thrown by God.  Near to it, however,<br />
was a tall tower that Gustafssen had not seen or even heard of before.</p>
<p>This area was declared a neutral territory by both sides of the<br />
war.  It contained - or should have contained - only the Queen&#039;s<br />
residence, and inviolable place that neither Reds nor Whites wanted to<br />
challenge.  But yet here was a second tower, tall and black, an<br />
obsidian dart to the Queen&#039;s diamond.</p>
<p>Soaring up into the sky, the potato saw tendrils of association and of<br />
possibility stretch out from the tower in all directions, constanly<br />
moving, as if some blind beast were tentatively feeling its way around<br />
the surrounding land.</p>
<p>Then to potato flew higher, higher still, up through the dome of the<br />
sky, and saw laid out before it a saucepan, a chopping board and a<br />
selection of particularly sharp-looking knives.</p>
<p>The potato suffered a religious experience, and woke up.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Just as Gustafssen was pondering what the starchy vision had shown him, a maid bustled in at rapid velocity of feet and words.</p>
<p>"Please-Mister-Gustaffsen-come-quickly-something&#039;s-wrong-in-the-kitchen-everyone&#039;s-shouting-that-they-need-your-help-please-bring-something-sciency!"<br />
she said, before departing with impressive speed.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>As the maid servant ran from the laboratory Gustafssen exclaimed.<br />
"Immer sie interupt am interessantesten von Momenten!!!"  Before<br />
carefully wrapping the feather in impervious cabbage and telling<br />
Schrodinger to take it to high security storage in the vegetable<br />
patch.  The fairy technician nodded and ran off carrying his<br />
package, pale faced but compliant.</p>
<p>As he strode about his lab throwing things into his bag Gustafssen<br />
started muttering to himself,  "Ich hoffe, da? es nicht wie<br />
letztes Mal ist.  Ich erkl‰rte der Herzogin, die ihre Unterw‰sche<br />
gerade nicht zum opperate bei den optimalen Icecreamtemperaturen<br />
entworfen ist."  Only pausing to yell, "Heisenberg!!!!  What<br />
ever it is that you do go do it in the Kitchen please"</p>
<p>Finally when everything was prepared he picked the potato up and popped<br />
it into his bag also before heading off out the lab and towards the<br />
kitchens.  As he disappeared around a corner all that could be<br />
herd drifting back was the clank of his bag and the words  "I mean<br />
after that they were picking bits of chef, ice cream and whale bone<br />
corset out of the walls for weeks afterwards..."</p>

<p>Translation 2)  I hope it&#039;s not like last time.  I told the<br />
Duchess that her underwear just isn&#039;t designed to opperate at optimum<br />
icecream temperatures.  ]</p>
