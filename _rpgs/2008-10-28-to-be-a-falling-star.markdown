<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The evening was drawing in over the castle, and children and parents<br />
alike gathered around it.  At some secret signal, computer systems<br />
lit software fuses, and the countdown began.</p>
<p>Three seconds.  The onlookers were increasing steadily in number, staring up at the castle and at the night sky beyond.</p>
<p>Two seconds.  Behind the castle, a select few looked out proudly over their series of tubes, each pointing skywards.</p>
<p>One second.  High up on the castle walls, the caretakers who had<br />
just finished removing an unexpected 30-foot-high advertisement, opened<br />
a Thermos of tea.</p>
<p>Fire.  A rushing noise, then another and another and another, up into the sky, up and up and level and down and -</p>
<p>BANG.  Bangbangbang bang bang, the sky exploded into a thousand<br />
colours, red and green and white and everything else besides, lighting<br />
up the castle as if a new sun had dawned, forming shapes and patterns<br />
in the sky.</p>
<p>A shooting star shot overhead, then another, then another.  Then<br />
another, much brighter one, which failed to fade into nothing.  In<br />
fact it faded more into a fireball, arcing out of the heavens towards<br />
the castle, smashing through the highest tower, reducing crenellations<br />
to dust, scattering the workmen not far below, then carrying on over<br />
the castle walls and into the lake beyond where the fire vanished in a<br />
gout of steam.</p>
<p>The fireworks continued overhead, but the air was thick with brick dust<br />
and no-one was in the mood for watching them any more.  They<br />
clustered around the lake, which still steamed and bubbled.</p>
<p>A few minutes passed before a patch of bubbles started making its was slowly to the shore.</p>
<p>An unruly mop of hair emerged, followed by a face, shoulders,<br />
body...  And there stood Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, dazed and<br />
lightly steaming, on the shores of the Seven Seas Lagoon, Disney World,<br />
Florida.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Gradually, it began to sink in. He wasn&#039;t in kansas any more Toto. Then<br />
he noticed the crowd gathered around and his celebrity instinct kicked<br />
in.</p>
<p>He struck a pose, hands on hips chin jutting out, mop of damp hair hanging down his face and grinned at his audience.</p>
<p>"Ta daaaaaa!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The ripple of onlookers&#039; expressions changing was quite visible, each<br />
one taking a minute or so to propagate from Hugh to the outer edge of<br />
the vast crowd.  First shock, then confusion, then finally<br />
appreciation.  Once the expressions were done with, cheers and<br />
claps radiated out as well.</p>
<p>The only ones not clapping, in fact, were a small group stood nearby -<br />
mostly consisting of a few managerial types and a number of police<br />
officers.  Who, without too much delay, began to push their way<br />
through the crowd towards Hugh.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"Thank you! Thank you! Be sure and stay for the rest of the fireworks, they&#039;re simply spectacular."</p>
<p>He picked a likely looking direction with as few managerial types as<br />
possible - they were bound to have tiresome questions that just<br />
wouldn&#039;t be fun to answer - and with a bounce in his step and a twinkle<br />
in his eye, bounded off towards Space Mountain. He didn&#039;t know why he<br />
was here, something to do with Gustaffson no doubt and of course he<br />
should be getting back soon.</p>
<p>But he&#039;d never been to Disneyland and now he was here, he didn&#039;t see why he couldn&#039;t have a bit of fun.</p>
<p><font color="red">OC: At this point, it&#039;d be really nice to remember what FairyPowers (tm) Hugh has. I suspect they might be useful.</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p><font color="red">OC: Hugh naturally has any ability that can be<br />
related to cooking.  He can make just about anything edible given<br />
time and condiments, he can tell the composition of things by smell,<br />
time things very accurately, and take charge of kitchens.  Stuff<br />
actually on your character sheet:<br />
Legerdemain 1: Gimmix (Minor telekinesis)<br />
Legerdemain 2: Ensnare (Major telekinesis, trip, tangle)<br />
Sovereign 1: Protocol (Enforce noble protocol and etiquette)<br />
Wayfare 1: Hopscotch (Anime jump)<br />
You&#039;re best at doing these things to inanimate objects, but can also do<br />
it to the full set of animate ones - humans, faeries and natural things.</font></p>
<p>Space Mountain loomed overhead, an upended saucepan of glittering<br />
lights, this generation&#039;s trivialised tribute to the next.  To<br />
Hugh its construction, its meaning, it&#039;s value - all readily<br />
apparent.  But to the vast majority of faeries, it would be as<br />
impenetrably bizarre as much of the rest of this world.</p>
<p>A few people wandered the paths of Disney World, though most still<br />
crowded around the lake watching the remainder of the fireworks or<br />
wandering what the hell just happened.</p>
<p>The steps up to Space Mountain were empty and a bored-looking attendant<br />
stood at the top, silently mourning the unfairness of the night<br />
shift.  Amidst all the not-yet-cleaned debris on the steps lay a<br />
ticket, perhaps discarded at the end of the day or perhaps dropped and<br />
sorely missed by some small child.</p>
<p>Either way, as Hugh examined it, it seemed that there was little in the park that this ticket <i>wouldn&#039;t</i> permit access to.</p>
<p><font color="red">OC Confession: I&#039;ve never been within a thousand<br />
miles of Disney World/Land/whatever this is, so my knowledge of the<br />
place comes entirely from Wikipedia =p</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p><font color="red">OC: For the best really. Neither have I. :)</font></p>
<p>Hugh whisked the ticket from the floor and bounded up the stairs to flash it in the face of the bored attendant.</p>
<p>"What ho tired looking sir! I intend to ride this Space Mountain of<br />
yours! You, I feel, should accompany me, for the night will be the<br />
merrier for us both then!"</p>
<p>Grinning infectiously and leaving the attendant no time to refuse, Hugh<br />
was past and leaping into the waiting carriage, settling in and waiting<br />
for the simple machinery to get to work and whisk him off.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I, er, I mean, I&#039;m..." stammered the ride attendant as he felt pulled<br />
towards the roller-coaster car by the sheer force of Hugh&#039;s magnetic<br />
personality.  Once inside, Hugh reached out and flicked the<br />
control lever on, and together they sped onwards and upwards through<br />
the retrofuturistic delights of Space Mountain.</p>
<p>A few minutes into the ride, the attendant&#039;s glazed eyes suddenly lit up - he had had a <i>thought</i>.</p>
<p>"Wait, you...  Aren&#039;t you that English guy off the telly?  Harry...  No, Hugh... Ferny Whatsitcalled!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"Fearnley Whittingstall dear boy, with an A. But call me Hugh do, I find all that business so terribly tiresome.</p>
<p>I say, does this thing go any faster? It&#039;s so terribly tame."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"No, sir, I&#039;m afraid..." the attendant began, before a strange compulsion came over him.</p>
<p>"Actually, er...  We&#039;re not really supposed to do this, but..."</p>
<p>The man produced from his pocket a heavy, rugged-looking device.<br />
He flipped up the clear plastic cover over part of the thing, revealing<br />
a button marked "Emergency Use Only: Retrieve Cars".  His finger<br />
stopped half an inch from the button, shaking nervously.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"Don&#039;t tell me you&#039;ve never been up here on your day off and pushed the button?"</p>
<p>Hugh looked faintly aghast for a moment, then leaned over and nodded encouragingly.</p>
<p>"Go on. Let&#039;s see what this ride can really do! What&#039;s the worst that can happen?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, I..." he stammered, "I guess I... never..."</p>
<p>He looked down at the control, then up at Hugh.</p>
<p>"Ah well, what could possibly go-"</p>
<p>He pushed his thumb down onto the button and immediately the ride<br />
jerked into acceleration, jolting Hugh&#039;s glasses from his face and the<br />
speed control clean out of the ride attendant&#039;s hands.  He looked<br />
at Hugh, panic smeared across his face, whilst the Space Mountain cars<br />
got faster, and faster, and faster...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"Now this..."</p>
<p>Bellowed Hugh over the rushing wind,</p>
<p>"... is more like it!"</p>
<p>He gestured absent-mindedly in the air and pulled forth a bag of<br />
popcorn, which immediately started to shake and rustle madly. He<br />
clutched onto it fiercely as the ride bucked down a long downward<br />
stretch, screaming down the cold iron of the tracks as the metal was<br />
stressed to a point it was never really intended to.</p>
<p>"Popcorn?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>On and on, the rollercoaster car rocketed around Space Mountain, up<br />
through its tallest heights, back down through the boarding area and<br />
round again, not stopping, going ever faster.</p>
<p>The attendant&#039;s hands gripped tight to the bar in front of them, his<br />
knuckles whitening like a toothpaste commercial.  He flashed Hugh<br />
an incredulous glare for the briefest of seconds when he was offered<br />
popcorn, before returning his focus to the reassuring safety bar.</p>
<p>"What?!" he screamed over the rising wind.  "Popcorn?!  How<br />
the hell does that even stay in there?  How can you eat popcorn at<br />
a time like this?!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>The poor boy seemed a bit tense. Hugh set the popcorn down on his<br />
armrest and leaned into the next bend, still grinning like a loon. As<br />
the carriage straightened out with a jerk and somehow managed to<br />
continue its acceleration up a long and steep hill, he pulled two dark<br />
rich pints of ale from the other side of the carriage. The laws of<br />
physics, by now horribly confused and not quite sure which way to look<br />
from the embarrassment of it all had a brief argument with the beer<br />
regarding surface tension and suggested that perhaps the beer should be<br />
sloshing everywhere, but the yeasty liquid was having none of it and<br />
remained firmly in the glasses as one was thrust at the attendant.</p>
<p>"Rel-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-x"</p>
<p>The effect of the stern injunction was perhaps diminished by the dive<br />
down the other side and poor abused Nature took the opportunity to<br />
sneakily break a few of the bolts holding the thing together, but her<br />
heart wasn&#039;t really in it. Besides, the carriage, which had never had<br />
so much fun its life, had no intention of falling apart now and was<br />
beginning to glow, though probably more from the heat and pressure on<br />
the bearings than the excitement of it all.</p>
<p>Hugh sipped and the ride continued apace, the stars and planets blurring and twisting into a vortex of varicoloured light.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Trying to concentrate on anything but the swirling vortex in front of<br />
him that only barely still resembled Space Mountain, the attendant<br />
focussed on his watch instead.  It wasn&#039;t an immensely reassuring<br />
thing to do, as he found himself counting how long it took to do each<br />
complete lap of the ride.</p>
<p>Normally, it took a good five minutes.</p>
<p>Ten seconds.</p>
<p>"Ten seconds?!" he shouted into the voice-blanketing roar of the wind.  "How is that even possible?!"</p>
<p>Eight seconds.</p>
<p>It could only have been the centripetal force keeping the boy&#039;s dinner<br />
inside of him now, as the rollercoaster car looped in and out of<br />
impossibly tight curves.</p>
<p>Though the scene was almost entirely lost on those travelling in the<br />
improbably fast car, just then, a potato hopped out of Hugh&#039;s left<br />
lapel pocket.  "Aha!" it exclaimed.  "A velocity in excess of<br />
0.1c with minimal synchrotron radiation!  Herr Professor must be<br />
informed!"</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, it pulled a pair of aviator goggles over what must<br />
have been its front half, leapt up onto the front of the rollercoaster<br />
car and promptly span away into the night, the unfortunate victim of<br />
very unlikely levels of air resistance.</p>
<p>Six seconds...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Hugh grinned and resisted the urge to clap his hands with delight - it<br />
would have been most unbecoming. But this was a lot more fun than he<br />
had expected.</p>
<p>"Hey! Want to see a neat trick?"</p>
<p>He stretched a finger out into the mishmash of blurred light and sound<br />
that surrounded the cart and dragged it along, swirling it around in a<br />
little circle of its own. When he pulled it back inside the cart, it<br />
was coated in a thick cloud of glittering light, although it was<br />
now  static and silent.</p>
<p>One quick lick later, his face was coated in the same stuff, smeared across his lips and nose like electric candyfloss.</p>
<p>"How fast now laddy?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Three-seconds-what-the-hell-did-you-just-pull-candyfloss-out-of-the-air,"<br />
blurred the ride attendant, his eyes flashing manically between Hugh,<br />
his watch and the increasingly improbable outside world.</p>
<p>Hugh just grinned as the man&#039;s fascination with his watch grew steadily more constant.</p>
<p>"Two seconds...  Sir, what does-  One second-"</p>
<p>"Half a-"</p>
<p>"Qua-"</p>
<p>If there had been any time left in which for him to have seen it, the<br />
attendant might have seen the hands of his watch stop, go backwards, or<br />
perhaps something even stranger.  He might also have noticed the<br />
burst of light, the almost instantaneous self-dismantling of Space<br />
Mountain, and the slow grating noise of a number of prominent<br />
physicists turning in their graves.</p>
<p>Sadly though, this was lost on both of them.  As was everything<br />
else, until the time the two of them regained consciousness.</p>
<p>The ride attendant returned to awakeness first, rolled over and vomited<br />
copiously.  Then he looked around him, took in the grass and trees<br />
of impossibly verdant green, the sky so blue it felt multicoloured, and<br />
was sick again.</p>
<p>He crawled unsteadily over to Hugh, and shook him into consciousness too.</p>
<p>"Sir!  Sir!  Mister Ferny Whiting!" he shouted, eventually<br />
rousing the dazed chef.  "Oh good," he said, seeing Hugh&#039;s eyes<br />
flicker open.  "Now, what the hell?  And where are we?"</p>
<p>To the man himself, opening his eyes to a cloudless and irridescent<br />
daytime sky, the last question was not a tricky one.  They were in<br />
faerie.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Hugh sat up, crossing his legs and taking another bite of the still whirling lightcandyfloss. He grinned stickily.</p>
<p>"Not the foggiest I&#039;m afraid old boy. I&#039;m sure if we take a bit of a<br />
wonder, we&#039;ll soon bump into someone who&#039;ll be all to happy to tell us<br />
we&#039;re trespassing.</p>
<p>Won&#039;t that be fun?"</p>
<p>He rolled up and pottered off, away from the somewhat pungent grass,<br />
picking his direction entirely at random to see what could be seen.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Yes," mumbled the ride attendant.  "I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be... wonderful."</p>
<p>He picked himself slowly off the floor and attempted to brush some of<br />
the vomit and grass stains from his once immaculate Disney Minion<br />
uniform.  He kept his eyes low, avoiding looking at the sky,<br />
although truth be told the colour of the grass was not much less<br />
disturbing.</p>
<p>"Sir, the, er...  The grass and that.  It looks weird.<br />
I ain&#039;t seen grass like it before.  And the sky..."  He<br />
paused for a second, his face turning a deeper shade of green.<br />
"This...  Is this England?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"England? Heavens no boy, you can tell from the lack of rain, overcast<br />
skies and of course queues. No boring lines of patiently polite people<br />
makes it no England."</p>
<p>Around him the grass set to whispering and began, tentatively, to form<br />
little queues leading to the odd mushroom. One of them seemed to have<br />
developed a clipboard already.</p>
<p>"Come now, don&#039;t dilly dally. The party was a mass of intrigue when I<br />
left and I&#039;m sure Gustaffson will have blown something new up since<br />
then - hungry work of course. Yes. And that candy floss ... well, we<br />
can definitely invent a whole new dessert from that alone!"</p>
<p>And so he ambled through the countryside, muttering to himself and more or less entirely ignoring the poor lost attendant.</p>
