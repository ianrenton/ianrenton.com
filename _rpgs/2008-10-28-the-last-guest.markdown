<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane could mostly see the Mists, and the vague outline of a road<br />
through the ever-changing scenery. For infinite potential, they<br />
certainly didn&#039;t look like much. She didn&#039;t feel it was a particularly<br />
auspicious homecoming, but she figured that after a century of<br />
gallivanting in the human world, undertaken to escape a war in Faerie<br />
only to wind up running from several more banal ones, your relatives<br />
had the right to wonder what had happened to you.</p>
<p><i>Besides, it just isn&#039;t -fun- anymore,</i> she admitted to herself. <i>When<br />
your carefully cultivated image and your treasured hat are the objects<br />
of ridicule, and the most fascinating job in the world turns into being<br />
a glorified delivery girl for court summonses, there&#039;s no -point-.<br />
Maybe if all the technology makes it interesting again, sometime.</i><br />
Until then, she&#039;d tied up all the loose ends on her current cases,<br />
stuck a large "Gone Fishing-Indefinitely" sign on her office door and<br />
left a relevant message on her answering machine, and headed to Faerie.</p>
<p>She knew she&#039;d been away a long time. She figured the lack of postcards<br />
probably meant she&#039;d been written off as a lost cause, so she was<br />
carrying several large tubs of Ben and Jerry&#039;s with her - one way to<br />
placate a large quantity of disapproving relatives might be to assuage<br />
the ever-present ice cream addiction of the resident Princess.</p>
<p>With a sigh, she adjusted the collar on her trenchcoat, pulled her<br />
favourite hat down a bit further, blew a few stray wisps of red hair<br />
away from her eyes. <i>What would Philip Marlowe do?</i><br />
she wondered. He&#039;d have a smoke, probably, and everything would fall<br />
into place. But then, whilst cigarettes were easily available, family<br />
was far more complex solving than solving a mystery - and Philip<br />
Marlowe wasn&#039;t Fae.</p>
<p>The Mists parted....</p>
<p><i>((OOC: Woot, I am in! Fi~nally~! :D))</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As the mists faded out in front of her, in behind her, and down into<br />
the ground, Akane found herself at the edge of a forest and looking up<br />
towards the hill on which stood the Honeysuckles&#039;... cottage.</p>
<p>While it retained all the attributes that those back in the human world<br />
would doubtless describe as either "quaint" or "picturesque", it and<br />
the land around it lacked much of other important things like<br />
"bustling".  And also "town".</p>
<p>The whole place, in fact, was a lot quieter and a lot emptier than Akane remembered.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane blinked to herself in confusion. <i>It looks like they just packed up and moved away. Did the war head this way, I wonder?</i><br />
Either way, she wasn&#039;t going to find out standing at the edge of the<br />
forest, but there might be some clue as to what happened in the house.</p>
<p><i>But what if the armies <b>did</b> come here, and there are soldiers or bandits hiding out inside the house?</i> her mind immediately offered.</p>
<p>She took stock of the situation. The approach to the cottage from the<br />
woods did not offer as much cover as she would like, but she figured<br />
that being armed and able to fight back outweighed whatever advantage<br />
she might get in terms of stealth by sneaking up in fox shape.</p>
<p>She shouldered the backpack containing the ice cream in its insulated<br />
bag and headed up the hill as quickly and quietly as possible, eyes<br />
constantly scanning her surroundings for signs of life, or any<br />
indication as to where the Honeysuckles and their people had<br />
disappeared to....</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Akane proceded, warily but unimpeded towards the cottage.  Even up<br />
until the point she reached the door, she heard not a sound that did<br />
not originate in the trees or the sky.</p>
<p>Quietly pushing open the unlocked door, Akane stepped inside and let<br />
the somewhat confusing mash of spacetime unfold into the foyer around<br />
her.  Alone in the room that was several times the size that the<br />
entire building appeared from the outside, she let her gaze drift about<br />
the more obvious abnormalities.  Those being, in approximate order<br />
of unexpectedness, the portrait of the heads of the house, and a gilded<br />
invitation on the desk in front of her.</p>
<p>The portrait, which once contained the smiling faces of the old Duke<br />
and Duchess Honeysuckle, now contained a picture of an older but<br />
none-the-less recognisable Princess Ilandra; shown characteristically<br />
attempting to grab a passing butterfly with no thought whatsoever to<br />
the composition of the picture.</p>
<p>The invitation, on the other had, was as formal as they come.  It read, in handwriting unknown,</p>
<p>"To my most esteemed friends, nobles of House Honeysuckle,<br />
You are cordially invited to a reception tonight, at Castle Poppy, held<br />
on account of our long-delayed homecoming.  All are invited!<br />
Awaiting the honour of your arrival,<br />
Duchess Regara of House Poppy"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>She stared. Princess Ilandra. <i>Duchess</i> Ilandra. But the succession was always determined by primogeniture. But she was <i>Duchess</i> Ilandra. Which made her the eldest surviving heir to the House. Which made her...</p>
<p><i>My aunt and uncle are gone. Lysander is gone. And my cousin Ilandra is the Duchess.</i></p>
<p>That thought hit her harder than the London bombings she had crossed<br />
the Atlantic to escape. She&#039;d left the war behind her, but others<br />
hadn&#039;t. She&#039;d lived with the humans for a century, but it hadn&#039;t been<br />
that much time in Faerie by comparison. And Ilandra was the Duchess.<br />
What about the town? Had the war taken them too? Or <i>was</i> it the war? If it had been anything darker, then Ilandra might be in danger...</p>
<p><i>She&#039;s just a kid! No, she wouldn&#039;t be anymore, would she,</i> Akane admitted to herself. <i>She&#039;ll do very well. For one, all she needs to do to maintain the House neutrality is to not take anything very seriously.</i><br />
The only thing she remembered her cousin taking seriously was Cain.<br />
Whether or not this had changed, it would serve her well as a facade.</p>
<p>If the House was this deserted, then the losses surely extended beyond the Duke and Duchess...the <i>old</i><br />
Duke and Duchess...and Lysander. Ilandra would need all the help she<br />
could get. And Akane wasn&#039;t really a family person, but she had cared<br />
about her cousin.</p>
<p>Where <i>was</i> Ilandra anyway? Akane frowned at the invitation. <i>With the Poppies, maybe?</i> At least, if the invitation had been left here, that probably meant there were no threats in the house. No overt ones anyway.</p>
<p>So. First, to see who was left. Then, to find Ilandra. After that,<br />
they&#039;d probably need to go to this reception. And hopefully at some<br />
point along the line she&#039;d gain some idea of what the hell was going<br />
on....</p>
<p><i>((OOC: sleepy post! will look it over tomorrow. not much in the way of literary merits, but should be enough to be going on))</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As Akane lifted her eyes from the invitation, the lurking butler drew up alongside her.</p>
<p>"Ah, Miss Akane," he said, his mouth adressing her whilst his brain was<br />
clearly about other business.  "I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be wanting to pay<br />
a visit to the Duchess - she&#039;s currently in attendance at Castle<br />
Poppy.  Some form of celebration, I&#039;m led to..."</p>
<p>He slowed, stuttered and stopped, and turned to face her.</p>
<p>"Miss Akane?  Oh, my, where <i>have</i> you been?  We&#039;ve<br />
all been so worried...  Please, sit, relax," he said, ushering her<br />
in the direction of a drawing room.  "Please, let me take your<br />
bag..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane whirled, hand moving to the gun holstered beneath her coat, then relaxed at the sight of the butler. <i>Looks<br />
like it&#039;s not occupied territory here after all. That&#039;s good. Aside<br />
from whatever resulted in the town being gone and Ilandra being<br />
Duchess, that is...</i> She could amost hear parts of her brain that she was fairly sure she had a use for spluttering and grinding to a halt.</p>
<p>"Yes, I think sitting down would be a good idea right about now," she<br />
acknowledged, and let the butler usher her into a chair. "Make sure the<br />
ice cream is kept cold, I&#039;ll be taking it to Ilandra. I&#039;ve been with<br />
the humans. It was interesting, at times. How long have I been gone? I<br />
kind of lost track of the timestreams, I was having fun."</p>
<p>"It&#039;s been years. We assumed you&#039;d fallen in the war, or Banality had taken you."</p>
<p>"I&#039;m sorry I worried everyone," she said sheepishly, finding it politic<br />
not to add that she hadn&#039;t wanted to stick out her neck for <i>either</i> of the Roses, thankyouverymuch. "...Erm, yes, everyone. Where <i>is</i> everyone?" she asked through her shock.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Why, everyone&#039;s..." the Butler struggled.  "Ilandra&#039;s staying at<br />
the Poppies&#039;, the medical staff are about their business, I&#039;m here with<br />
you, and, um...  Well, that&#039;s where everyone is."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Oh," said Akane faintly. "Which is to say, we&#039;re everyone? Then what<br />
happened to...everybody else?" The part of her brain which analysed<br />
data and was attempting to make sense of the information she was being<br />
given informed her that this meant she was one of the last living<br />
nobles of House Honeysuckle.<br />
"I know this must be hard for you and I&#039;m sorry to distress you," she<br />
said, trying to juggle empathy and mental turmoil. "But I need to know.<br />
How...how did it happen?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Casualties of war, miss," the butler said.  "I suppose if you<br />
came here directly you&#039;ve not noticed, but these lands are not as<br />
happy, nor as populous, as they were not so long ago."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Oh, hell," her shoulders slumped. "Don&#039;t tell me they...no, of course<br />
they did, and it was the Red Roses&#039; side if Ilandra&#039;s with the Poppies.<br />
What were they thinking? We&#039;ve always been neutral, we don&#039;t have the<br />
manpower to fight a war, we train healers, not soldiers!" She noted<br />
that her voice had risen and if she did&#039;t calm down she&#039;d probably be<br />
spending more time in Hysteria than she had in Mundania. <i>Lysander, you idiot,</i> she thought. <i>If you hadn&#039;t gotten yourself killed I&#039;d kill you myself. Or sick Grizzel on you. Dammit, dammit... At least Ilandra&#039;s okay....</i><br />
Obviously she was not dealing with this very well, nevermind the fact<br />
that she could not really be expected to. Obviously she could not<br />
afford to break down, which meant Plan B: she needed to keep herself<br />
busy. With that decision made, she flew out of her chair.<br />
"I have to go. I&#039;m sorry," she said, "I need to...see Ilandra. If the<br />
diagnosis was &#039;missing, presumed killed or banal&#039; then I should<br />
probably correct the assumption as soon as possible."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Head east through the woods!" the butler called after Akane as she bolted from the cottage door.</p>
<p>Sprinting across the grass, Akane headed an approximation of East and<br />
quickly found a wide open track that led into a sparsely decorated<br />
forest.  At least, a forest that started off sparse.  With<br />
every hasty step Akane took, the vegetation grew thicker and the trees<br />
intertwined overhead, until the foliage gave itself up darkness and the<br />
path to mist.</p>
<p>A dozen paces and a jump later, the darkness and the mist unfolded from<br />
around her as quickly as they had encroached, leaving her standing only<br />
a short distance across open ground from the imposing stone of Castle<br />
Poppy; today more alive with flags and pennants than she ever<br />
remembered it being.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane made her way to the gate. Unsurprisingly, there was a guard<br />
there, although he was fidgeting in a manner that suggested he&#039;d<br />
probably rather be somewhere more interesting.<br />
"Excuse me," she addressed the man. "I&#039;m Akane. Lady Akane of House<br />
Honeysuckle," she amended, remembering belatedly that one did did not<br />
usually walk into a House&#039;s keep without having business there, and<br />
she&#039;d run off in such a hurry that she&#039;d forgotten to pick up the<br />
invitation. Still, she&#039;d dealt with the humans&#039; bureauracy, so this<br />
shouldn&#039;t be too hard by comparison... "I&#039;m here to see the Duchess<br />
Ilandra."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Tha Duchess Ilandra?" the guard asked in his finest Westcountry.<br />
"But the Duchess Poppy is corlled...  Oh, wait, Ilandra?  Oi<br />
did hear somethin&#039; &#039;bout an..."</p>
<p>The guardsman looked vacant for a moment, as though transfixed by some wondrous sight on the other side of Akane&#039;s head.</p>
<p>"Well, oi&#039;m sure as you know more about it all than me.  You&#039;d<br />
best go on in, I&#039;m sure tha party&#039;ll be startin&#039; afore long."</p>
<p>That said, his face took on a sort of fixed worried expression, as if<br />
he wasn&#039;t quite sure if he&#039;d done the right thing, but was even less<br />
sure about whether he should correct himself...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>She felt like laughing, but didn&#039;t bother to explain to the man that it was the Duchess <i>Honeysuckle</i><br />
she was there to see - it looked like his brain was straining enough,<br />
so she simply walked in, looking for any trace of Ilandra&#039;s presence<br />
or, failing that, someone who could help Akane find her.</p>
