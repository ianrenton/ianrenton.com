<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Once he made it to the corridor he ducked behind a nearby tapestry and<br />
into a small alcove. A second worth of scrabbling along the bottom of<br />
the wall lead his fingers to a small button marked with the footprint<br />
of a rooster.</p>
<p>Silently, the centre section of the alcove slid open revealing a shaft<br />
decending into darkness with a single metal pole rising out of it&#039;s<br />
centre. A lightly glowing set of runes on the far wall marked out the<br />
words "To the Chicken-cave!"</p>
<p>Nyano gulped once, and then jumped across the gulf to grab hold of the<br />
pole. He slid down it with all the grace of a rat in a drainpipe and<br />
landed with a thump in the big barrel of feathers at the bottom.</p>
<p>There was a slight problem with this barrel of feathers, it had been<br />
designed to stop the fall of faeries who had a foot or so more height<br />
than the intrepid raccoon. So for a few terrible moments he Nyano found<br />
himself drowning in feathers.</p>
<p>Coughing and spulttering he emerged from the top of the barrel and<br />
rolled himself over the side. He found himself looking out across a<br />
cavern darkened by ominous clouds of smoke. The tiny pools of light<br />
cast by the wooden torches set irregularly into the walls served only<br />
to draw attention to the darkness that filled the rest of the room.</p>
<p>The darkness itself was not just the absense of light, perhaps once it<br />
had been just an ordinary gloom, but centuries of existence sealed away<br />
from any source of joy or happiness had changed it. Now it was a thing<br />
alive, it squatted here in jealous of any intusion from the outside.</p>
<p>The darkness was not the most horrific thing in the place though. That<br />
dubious pleasure belonged to the sounds. Perhaps it was awoken by the<br />
Raccoon&#039;s undignified arrival or perhaps it was always like this but<br />
there was an ungodly clucking echoing from every corner of the cave.<br />
The sound reverberated around the caverns, its pitch and timbre utterly<br />
unlike anything made by mortal mouths. Even the darkness seemed afraid<br />
of it, and the light recoiled away from the places that the sounds<br />
seemed loudest.</p>
<p>From out of this terrible cacophony strode a familliar figure but one<br />
who looked much more savage in this abhorrent light. The slight bend in<br />
his back and the oddness of his gait throwing monsterous shadows across<br />
the wall.</p>
<p>Nyano eyed the distance separating him from Mr Chicken, and decided to<br />
stay where he was, instead of crossing the distance he focused his<br />
attention on plucking the many stray feathers out of his fur.</p>
<p>Eventually the duchess&#039; retainer came over to him, and looked down at the raccoon. "To what cluck do I owe this cluck pleasure?"</p>
<p>"We have a long night ahead of us, the duchess wants all a message to<br />
get out to all of our spies. You are the only person who has the<br />
capability to contact all of them, I need your help!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m not sure it cluck need necessarily be such a cluck long night, my<br />
cluck Lord," said Mister Chicken, his head bobbing characteristically<br />
low.  "Our long cluck absence has meant that our cluck spies and<br />
those who pass messages cluck to them have had no-cluck-one to report<br />
to, and cluck thus have been cluck rather less detectable than is cluck<br />
normal.  The cluck majority of them have cluck survived, and all<br />
our intermediaries are still cluck cluck operational.  It should<br />
not be cluck difficult at all to contact everyone cluck."</p>
<p>That said, the servant moved deeper into the recesses of the cave, and<br />
began producing odd clunking noises from what looked like an expansive<br />
array of wooden levers.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano hurried over to the contraption  and checked to see that he<br />
was ready to recieve the communication. Once Mr Chicken nodded his<br />
assent, Nyano began his dictation.</p>
<p>"Our party was attacked by the servant of a man who identified himself<br />
as Indigo CLUCK, I mean STOP. He has been described as having a noble<br />
bearing, being tall with brown hair and with a stubbly chin CLUCK, I<br />
mean STOP. He was last seen in Hyacinth province in the sometime in the<br />
last few days STOP, I mean CLUCK. He is expected to go back there in<br />
two days time in order to complete a deal at sunset CLUCK. Make<br />
apprehending him your highest priority STOP. We need information on him<br />
and his allies CLUCK. He is known to work with the peasantry and to use<br />
poison STOP. He is to be considered highly dangerous STOP."</p>
<p>Nyano leaves a couple of seconds of silence to indicate he&#039;s finished the message, and then turns to Mr Chicken.</p>
<p>"Was that ok? I&#039;m not very good at this sort of thing" he asks</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Perfectly fine," said Mister Chicken as he turned to Nyano and smiled,<br />
"although cluck I think a couple of the cluck &#039;stop&#039;s may have been<br />
meant to be cluck &#039;cluck&#039;s.  Nevertheless, the messages will be on<br />
their way shortly!"</p>
<p>Over towards the rear of the room, a set of wooden cogwheels span and<br />
clicked, replacing a red sign that said "Receive" with a slightly more<br />
faded one that bore the legend "Aubergine Mode".</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano smiles with relief at having his mission finished and waves goodbye to Mr Chicken.</p>
<p>He wastes no time in returning to the barrel of feathers, and it only<br />
takes him a second to locate the handholds scratched into the wall of<br />
the chute. A couple of minutes of easy climbing later finds him back at<br />
the top of the wall and behind the tapestry.</p>
<p>Brushing himself off one final time, he heads back to the main hall to report to the duchess.</p>
