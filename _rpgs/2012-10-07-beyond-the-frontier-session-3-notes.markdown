Run time: 2h30m

Arken questions why the party are here. When the party question him, he's not really sure where “here” is – has heard of humans, elves etc but never met them before. He refers to his own species as “Earthborn”. Brought here in service to “our lord”, without being told why.

Tree-people arrive. Three fighty-types with one who looks more ornamented and non-threatening. She questions Arken first about Alita's death, then turns her attention to the party. Takes a special interest in / shows respect for the druid, asks if Alita died with honour.

Ascertains that she did, says it is unfortunate. When it is apparent that the party know very little, she takes them back to their “outpost”. She finally introduces herself as Ailsa, and explains all...

&nbsp;

<strong>Long, long ago...</strong>

In the early years of the empires of Man, a sorceress named Sharin-isha tired of the ways of her species and came here to escape the woes of her kind. But still they found her and came to her for advice and to ask for use of her powers, so she sought further escape. She developed a powerful magic that sent her far from this world, to another place where she lived out the rest of her days.

But so new was this magic that it was not perfected. Rather than simply sending her far away, it opened... a conduit to that other place, one that could be traversed in both directions. Those who lived in that other place longed to enter your world, and strived long and hard to widen that conduit. Half of one your years ago, it was done.

If you haven't guessed by now, those people were us. Our people in your tongue would be called Forestborn. We have come to visit the sacred lands from which Sharin-isha came.

But others came too, through that passageway she created. Others live in places like our home. Those of Arken's kind, and others. Though we are a peaceful people, others are... not.

<strong>End of storytime.</strong>

&nbsp;

So what can we do?

Forestborn are working to seal the conduit. They consider this world sacred and will cut themselves off from it if necessary to prevent it falling into the hands of those who would abuse it. But that still leaves Arken's kind, and their master who calls himself “Lord Granite” after the rock forged by fire. The Earthborn can be redeemed, but Granite will have to be dealt with.

&nbsp;

During planning, 3x air creatures attack.

“It appears there were... others.”

“In your tongue... Skyborn? They are capricious and every action they take is without method or motivation. They will not join our cause or any other, and their presence here is most worrying.”

&nbsp;

“So, will you help us cast these malign forces from your world? ...let me rephrase that – the Queen may choose to overlook Alita's murder if you choose to assist us in this matter.”

They talk to the Queen (who has no need for a name) at length.

&nbsp;

Ground rumbles, ginormous beast emerges. Forestborn guards engage with or without characters' help. Ailsa and more guards flee with the Queen, and the party, after a few combat rounds that endanger the characters but don't severely wound them.

End session.
