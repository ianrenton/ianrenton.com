<div><p>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="/rpgs/nobilis-where-only-lilies-grow">Nobilis: Where Only Lilies Grow</a>. (This page is written by a number of people, and is not Creative Commons licenced.)</p></div>

<DIV><DIV>The rest of the group left for the walls at a quick pace, leaving Alan and Scheherazade alone in what seemed the only place in the whole world in which there was any sense of calm.</DIV></DIV>
<DIV><DIV>In time, servants came to refill their tea, and the faint sound of sphinxes arguing with US Army troops drifted in from beyond the tightly-shut doors.  It seemed neither group was quite expecting -- or quite trusted -- the other.</DIV></DIV>
<BR /><DIV><DIV>"I must say," said the former Queen of Persia, "I am glad that despite the turmoil this place has encountered of late, it warms my heart to know that civility prevails.</DIV></DIV>

<DIV><DIV>"Now then, Alan, yes?  Do forgive me for asking, but I confess to being somewhat intrigued.  Did the gentleman called Benton refer to you as <i>deceased</i>?"</DIV></DIV>
<BR /><DIV><DIV>"He did, the last memory I have before here is of consuming a lethal dose of hydrogen cyanide. Maybe I did not take enough, maybe this place and its inhabitants are all part of some rather prosaic afterlife. And yourself ma'am, do you count yourself among the living?"</DIV></DIV>
<BR /><DIV><DIV>"It certainly feels that way to me, though considering that my personal idea of 'truth' at this point involves my having slept for two thousand years, perhaps it should not.  I surely do not feel <i>dead</i>."  She chuckled quietly.  "As if I have any idea what <i>that</i> feels like.</DIV></DIV>
<DIV><DIV>"No, given the events and, with all due respect, the bizarre group of acquaintances I have just made, it feels rather more like we are trapped within a story, a creation of some being's imagination.  And yet it still feels so very real, devoid of the frayed edges of perception one gets when one dreams; the missing senses, the non-sensical cause and effect.</DIV></DIV>
<DIV><DIV>"Without meaning to dredge up unwelcome memories, I take it this 'hydrogen cyanide' of yours is something that one does not usually... survive?"</DIV></DIV>

<BR /><DIV><DIV>"It was not my intention to survive. Like a deep sleep, I do not remember what it is to be dead." He grinned. "Which suggests that we are not, in fact, among the dead or the dreaming. I find the idea of a story an appealing explanation, certainly there has been too much of the fantastic already to suggest a complete return to life. It is all rather intriguing.</DIV></DIV>
<BR /><DIV><DIV>Now I come to think on it, meaning no disrespect, I had rather believed your fair self to be fictional."</DIV></DIV>
<BR /><DIV><DIV>"Fictional?" Scheherazade said.  "By the heavens, no, I assure you that I am real.  Although given the events of the last half hour, perhaps I should be questioning even that.  But if I am real, as I suppose, and two thousand years truly have passed since my true time, then I am honoured enough that I am still thought of even if it is as fiction."</DIV></DIV>
<DIV><DIV>She paused for a servant to refill her cup.</DIV></DIV>
<DIV><DIV>"Now that displacement from my 'true' time comes to mind, I would ask of you two questions.  Firstly are you - as I am - from <i>here</i>, and perhaps more confusingly: are you from <i>now</i>?"</DIV></DIV>
<BR /><DIV><DIV>"If I may be permitted a personal comment, you wear your millenia well.</DIV></DIV>
<BR /><DIV><DIV>Those are good questions both, I have been musing on them myself. I suggest that I am from neither here nor now - the decor and personages native to this place - yourself and the good military gent - seem to be of oriental extraction, where as I was from a small island called 'England'. The when is trickier. But the military gent wore a number of small devices and gadgets which speak of a manufacturing and technological capability far beyond that available in my time.</DIV></DIV>

<BR /><DIV><DIV>I would not like to put a figure on it, but I suspect it must be a good quarter century after my demise, though little more than 3 decades."</DIV></DIV>
<BR /><DIV><DIV>"England, England...  I confess, I have not heard of it," said Scheherazade.  "Perhaps it came after my time."</DIV></DIV>
<BR /><DIV><DIV>Just then, a knock came at the door.  Servants rushed in to open it, revealing a man also of Oriental extraction, dressed in flowing white robes.</DIV></DIV>
<DIV><DIV>"Shahryar!" Scheherazade exclaimed, standing and rushing forward as if to embrace him.  But she stopped halfway to the door.</DIV></DIV>
<DIV><DIV>"Wait," she said.  "You have some explaining to do."</DIV></DIV>
<DIV><DIV>"Yes, I do," he said, moving toward the cushions.  "Tea!"  The servants busied themselves once more with the pouring of tea into tiny cups.</DIV></DIV>
<DIV><DIV>Shahryar and Scheherazade both sat, and the once-King of Persia turned to Alan.</DIV></DIV>
<DIV><DIV>"You would be Mr Turing, correct?  Yes, I'm afraid I do know who you are, and shortly all will become much clearer.  I fear I owe you as many explanations, if not more, than I do to my beloved wife."</DIV></DIV>
<BR /><DIV><DIV>"Mr Shahryar." Alan greeted the newcomer with a polite bow and an outstretched hand.  "I take it then, that you bear some responsibility for our presence here?"</DIV></DIV>

<BR /><DIV><DIV>"I am afraid that I do," said Shahryar, "though I am sure that in your and the others' cases, you will find your present situation rather more agreeable than the one you were last in -- here, at least, your death is not imminent.</DIV></DIV>
<DIV><DIV>"In fact, you will probably find yourselves less susceptible to death in general than you are used to.  For you have been chosen, not directly by myself but by a force we can but pretend to comprehend, to become something greater still than what you were in life."</DIV></DIV>
<BR /><DIV><DIV>"My death, good sir, has already happened, and tis a poor afterlife indeed that dresses itself as the real thing."</DIV></DIV>
<BR /><DIV><DIV>Alans eyes glittered and he smiled.</DIV></DIV>
<BR /><DIV><DIV>"But let us take it as read for a moment that you speak truly, for it makes no less sense than anything else my senses tell me. Death-defying forces do not whimsically drag people back from the eternal slumber often, or the world would be awash with the dead. Which begs the question... Chosen for what?"</DIV></DIV>
