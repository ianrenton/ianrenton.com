<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Walking into his laboratory Gustafssen, his hair once more half shaggy<br />
mess, half neatly combed, spied Runciblespoon and Errrr what ever his<br />
name was standing stiffly to attention, lab coats neatly pressed and<br />
turned out, goggles resting neatly on their foreheads and both with<br />
huge protective gloves encasing their hands.  From the store room<br />
echoed the sounds of Schrodinger kitting himself up, whilst Heisenberg<br />
could be heard in the kitchen unit doing what ever it was that he did.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gut, gut. Aller ich bin wir bin hier f¸r diese bedeutsame Gelegenheit<br />
froh.&#8221;  &#8216;Never before has anything this momentous this world<br />
shattering been attempted&#8217; &#8220;Well at least not since that time we<br />
accidentally telefraged the duchess&#8217;s summer home with the Castle when<br />
testing the Vegetable patch relocation device.  But that&#8217;s neither<br />
here nor there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; muttered Runciblespoon, &#8220;We never could get the castle back onto its original foundations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Completely ignoring the muttered comment Gustafssen continues in his<br />
strange two toned voice.  &#8216;As you know, there is a possibility<br />
that a strange tower has been raised within the bounds of the Queens<br />
lands.&#8217;  &#8220;This is unheard of in our history, the Royal lands have<br />
always been sacrosanct respected by all sides in all wars.  And so<br />
we will be sending out a two pronged research team to investigate and<br />
report back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting the slight perkiness of his technicians he continued &#8216;Now we<br />
will be unable to spare any of you from your duties here in the<br />
laboratory&#8217; As they visibly wilted he carried on oblivious,  &#8216;This<br />
is why we have prepared these lists of items to collect.  We will<br />
reconvene in the Super Fast Evolve-o-Matic Ray room in half an<br />
hour.&#8217;  &#8220;Schnell schnell schnell!&#8221;</p>
<p>Carefully Gustafssen  placed Heisenberg and Schrodinger&#8217;s lists on<br />
the table and headed to the deepfreeze to gather his equipment.</p>
<p>&#8230; Time passes with much banging, clattering, high speed vegetable retrieval and general swearing occuring&#8230;</p>
<p>As the technicians raced around collecting bits and pieces, finely<br />
tuning this and that and generally looking harassed and busy Gustafssen<br />
approached one of the many blank walls in his laboratory and carefully<br />
touched a wall stone. &#8216;Vitamin levels correct and accounted for,<br />
faemetric readings accurate, please enter Herr Gustafssen.&#8217;  This<br />
done he stepped clean through the wall into the castles launch<br />
room.  Through the reinforced viewing screen he could see potatoes<br />
running about in methodical mayhem, slowly winching a giant marrow into<br />
place on the launch pad.  Then out from the changing rooms strode<br />
the intrepid few.  Despite being dressed in full space gear both<br />
Potatoes still wore their hats and had their Whips stowed at their<br />
belts.  The sprouts, looking particularly dashing in their<br />
military space combat dress, marched in unison carrying the bedraggled<br />
and unconscious form of the aubergine between them and escorting a<br />
slightly groggy looking potato who&#039;s helmet was topped with a little<br />
night cap.  Somehow between its repeated escape attempts if had<br />
managed to adorn its flight gear in those strange symbols it had<br />
tattooed all over its skin. Finally came the floret of cauliflower, its<br />
belt of explosives, grenades and a backpack full of dynamite carefully<br />
stowed in a bomb proof sardine tin which floated along behind it.<br />
As they reached the marrow, now firmly in place, those vegetable<br />
conscious enough turned and saluted up to the control room before<br />
embarking.  At which point the aubergine made one last desperate<br />
attempt to run for it, but was skilfully brought down as two whips<br />
wrapped themselves around its lower half.</p>
<p>Finally Gustafssen lowered the tinted goggles over his eyes and pressed<br />
the button labelled &#8216;blast off!&#8217; and a great whooping sound echoed out<br />
and the massed ranks of vegetables cleared the decks.   Then<br />
with a great roar and shudder the ICBM rose from its resting place a<br />
flew up the exit tubes&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; In one of the castles quiet courtyards a fishpond slid aside quite<br />
startling a young pair of fairies who were canoodling on its rim, and<br />
from out of the depths rose the great marrow roaring its way into the<br />
sky and the great beyond&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;  Back in the lab the Fae scientist exited the launch room and headed towards the Super Fast Evolve-o-Matic Ray room.</p>
<p>Finally all was prepared.  In front of the great scientist stood three tiny puffball mushrooms neatly arrayed on a</p>

<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p><font color="red">OOC: Part 2:</font></p>
<p>Finally all was prepared.  The Super Fast Evolve-o-Matic Ray had<br />
been finely tuned to within a micron, the workbenches and tables were<br />
loaded down with a mixture of strange occasionally smoking concoctions<br />
and the Mk. 4 Wettersteuervorrichtung had been cleaned and stood<br />
sparkling in the sun; every scrap of bird crap having been removed and<br />
stored for later fertiliser purposes.</p>
<p>In front of the great scientist stood three tiny puffball mushroom<br />
spores neatly arrayed on a tray underneath a giant magnifying<br />
glass.  Slowly and carefully removed vile after vile of strangely<br />
coloured liquids and gasses from a tray in front of him and aimed and<br />
gently sprayed them at the spores.  On the tray beside the spores<br />
hundreds of miniature televisions screened movies, dreams and technical<br />
manuals constantly.  And as he worked Gustafssen mumbled to<br />
himselves, &#8220;Now let me see, Observation&#8221;, &#8216;yes.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Craftiness?&#8221;  &#8216;Just a smidge.&#8217;  &#8220;Cool and cunning?&#8221; &#8216;Most<br />
defiantly.  A Spot of curiosity?&#8217;  &#8220;Most certainly I<br />
think.&#8221;  &#8220; &#8216;Ahhh yes a good dose of EMP, psychic abilities and<br />
remote viewing.&#8221; &#8217;  On and on he went, listing qualities, movies,<br />
books, and people and as he listed another small cloud puffed over the<br />
spores and sank deep into their very being.  Only a small number<br />
of viles were not used, those labelled, &#8216;Austin Powers&#8217;, &#8216;Inspector<br />
Jacques Clouseau&#8217;, &#8216;Maxwell Smart&#8217; among others.</p>
<p>Finally he looked up at the expectant and fearful faces of his<br />
technicians.  &#8220; &#8216;It is Time&#8217; &#8221; he said in unison, and at these<br />
words they scrambled to their places as Gustafssen reverently placed<br />
the spores below the Super Fast Evolve-o-Matic Ray.  Then with<br />
absolute care he positioned the head of the &#8216;Q inspirational<br />
amplification matrix&#8217; and focused it on the spores.  Then he<br />
activated the pulse-omatic strobification unit, and cranked the handle<br />
of the Multivitamin enhancer.  Before finally allowing a single<br />
drop of &#8216;Gustafssen&#8217;s Baby-bio miracle grow glamour formula&#8217; to soak<br />
into each spore.  Stepping back from his work he headed once more<br />
to his work bench and lowered his goggles.</p>
<p>"Errr What ever your name is.  Raise the lightning rods!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Runciblespoon would you be so kind as to Fire up the sonic occilators!!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Schrodinger Crank the Newtonian compensators 7 notches!!!</p>
<p>&#8216; &#8220;Heisenberg for once in you life do something and Initiate the Pseudoscientific sprocket field!!!!&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Gustafssen, I would be honoured if a genius such as yourself would throw the switch on my mark.&#8217;  &#8220;Certainly Mein Herr.&#8221;</p>
<p>5...</p>
<p>As he started the countdown a wining started to build within the lab,<br />
rising up through the audio spectrum and tap dancing its way through<br />
along the fairies teeth like foil on fillings.</p>
<p>4...</p>
<p>Multi coloured lightning began to flash around the room and spreading<br />
out into the floors and corridors of the castle, grounding on various<br />
objects and leaving behind blackend scorch marks and Nobles and<br />
Servants alike quaking in fear behind anything they thought Gustafssen<br />
proof.</p>
<p> 3...</p>
<p>As the noise built up objects started to bounce about the castle<br />
furniture clattered, eggs cooked and exploded in their shells and<br />
occasionally a rather startled fish would crash to the floor and<br />
shatter into a thousand fishy pieces with a crystalline tinkle.</p>
<p>2...</p>
<p>In the lab the four fairy technicians dived for the cover or their<br />
Cabbage reinforced blast screens, not even daring to look at their<br />
employer as he stood in the strange pulsing light of the machine with a<br />
manic grin plastered across his face.  Throughout the castle raw<br />
glamour pulsed and oozed from objects, underwear and corsetry<br />
spontaneously turned to small rose scented pink butterflies in an ever<br />
expanding ring around Duchess Regara unleashing a rose scented storm of<br />
brain mulching images and embarrassment upon all present.</p>
<p>1...MARK!!!!!!</p>
<p>All the world warped and quailed around him Gustafssen quietly and confidently threw the switch&#8230;</p>
<p><font color="red">OOC: EMP: Extra Mushroomy Perception</font></p>
<p>Part 3 is still to come.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>&#8230; and the world stopped, not for long but just enough time to make<br />
every creature in the castle think &#8216;Wuh?&#8217;  And then with a loud<br />
&#8216;Glooooup&#8217; the world restarted itself and the deafening quiet of the<br />
aftermath rang out through Castle Poppy.  Glamour stopped its<br />
oozing and froze solidly in place, nobles and servants crawled<br />
hesitantly out from their hiding places and little pink butterflies<br />
froze mid flight and hung in the air like a rose scented confetti<br />
screen.</p>
<p>In his laboratory Gustafssen stepped away from the switch, leaving a<br />
perfect outline imprinted on the wall.  Looking at the three tiny<br />
spores he chuckled to himself in glee, a sound which made the<br />
technicians attempt to sink into the floor.</p>
<p>Quickly he placed each spore into a giant bucket of earth and gently<br />
patted down the earth around it.  Then taking out the bottle of<br />
&#8216;Gustafssen&#8217;s Baby-bio miracle grow glamour formula&#8217; he administered<br />
two small drops and cried.  &#8220; &#8216;To the tower!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>A loud thump echoed down the corridor outside Gustaffsons lab. It was<br />
swiftly followed by another much smaller bang, a shout of incoherent,<br />
but very British , rage and a series of soft squishing sounds.</p>
<p>They culminated in a soft bubbling and a discreet cough. Moments later,<br />
Hugh sauntered into the lab trailing noodles everywhere and looking<br />
faintly embarassed. Though grinning and looking like a man much more<br />
awake than he had been 5 minutes ago.</p>
<p>"Well that was ... an experience.</p>
<p>What ho Gustaffson! I take it you&#039;re responsible for the tremblings in the very nature of what faerie wasn&#039;t meant to wot at?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Guter Tag mein Freund.&#8221; &#8216;We&#8217;re afraid we can&#8217;t really stop and<br />
chat.&#8217;  &#8220;we&#8217;re in the middle of an experiment don&#8217;t you<br />
know!&#8221;  As he said this two of the scientist&#8217;s technicians dashed<br />
out the door carrying a bucket of earth between them and making a<br />
beeline for the stairs.  &#8220;Grab a bucket and help Runciblespoon<br />
carry it to the tower&#8221; &#8216;And don&#8217;t touch what&#8217;s growing in the earth!&#8217;<br />
&#8220;The worlds future lies in those dark moist depths!&#8221;  This said<br />
Gustafssen dashed out the door bucket and technician in tow, followed<br />
by Runciblespoon who was making good headway with his load.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"Oh I say! Watch out for the wild noodles though, they&#039;re somewhat frisky today."</p>
<p>Warning delivered, Hugh quickstepped over to the buckets, picked one up and followed the scientists.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>As the scientific expedition raced through the castle Nobles and<br />
servants dived out the way, once more scuttling into their places of<br />
safety.  Many had seen the effects of Gustafssen&#8217;s experiments on<br />
random passers by and those who accidentally collided with them, and<br />
few wanted that to happen to them&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;A short time later the Group of fae burst out onto the top of the<br />
Weather tower carefully placing the three giant tubs on the ground<br />
before collapsing into a giant exhausted heap.</p>
<p>Moments later Gustafsen was up chivvying his lackeys with all the crazy<br />
energy that one crazed and ingenious fae could muster.  &#8220;Hast,<br />
Hast, Hast!  Quickly now move the three containers to the<br />
specially erected platforms.&#8221; &#8216;And what ever you do, do not touch the<br />
mushrooms!  They are not yet ready.&#8217;  As he said this all<br />
eyes on the tower locked onto the three mushrooms who&#8217;s fruiting bodies<br />
were breaking through the surface of the soil and growing rapidly in<br />
the containers.</p>
<p>As the technicians ran to position their charges Gustafssen scuttled<br />
over to the control panel the master of Fae science surveyed his<br />
creation, eyes a glisten with happiness and expectation.  Gently a<br />
hand reached out and stroked the levers, knobs and switches arrayed<br />
before him.  Then his hands started moving with more purpose,<br />
flipping stitches, turning wheels and pushing buttons.  Soon<br />
lights and dials were flickering as his fingers danced their way across<br />
the controls.  &#8220;Runciblespoon!&#8221; &#8216;Would you be so kind as to as to<br />
crank the suetpiezoelectric pulse generator up to Maximum power<br />
generation.&#8217;  &#8220;You!  Errr what ever your name is.<br />
Remove the Astrolabe from the sweet and sour sauce and place it into<br />
the garlic and herb solvent solutions.  We need as much<br />
conductivity as possible!&#8221;</p>
<p><font color="red">OOC:   Well that&#039;s the start of the<br />
post.  Unfortunatly after a &#039;discussion&#039; with my mother about<br />
future and jobs etc I&#039;m not really in the mood for finishing it at the<br />
moment.  But I thought i&#039;d post some at the moment just to show<br />
that stuff is being done.</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>As the small metal device slide into the glisten and very tasty white<br />
liquid a small whirlwind started to form over the top of the tower,<br />
twisting and turning it gently tugged at the hair and clothing of all<br />
those on the tower.  &#8220;We need more power!&#8221;  Mused the Fae<br />
scientist before quickly turning to a giant wheel and started to turn<br />
it. &#8216;Yes I believe perhaps ad few twists should do it.&#8217;  15 turns<br />
latter the whirlwind span harder and harder.  Soon the Chef and<br />
the accompanying technicians were grabbing hold of anything solid and<br />
fixed down.  RuncibleSpoon edged his way along the walls towards<br />
Hugh, he tried shouting in his ear but the roar of the wind was to<br />
strong.  So with urgent gestures he showed him how to extract the<br />
tomato vines from the edge of the towers and wrap it into a rudimentary<br />
safety harness.</p>
<p>Calmly and quietly Gustaffsen stood in eye of the storm, his hair being<br />
gently tossed in a light breeze.  As his compatriots were clinging<br />
to the vines for dear life the old grump ran around like a child<br />
happily chattering to himself, once more throwing switches, flipping<br />
panels and pressing buttons.  At one point he even removed a small<br />
conductor&#8217;s baton, blonde wig and green pointed hat from a cupboard and<br />
whilst wearing the wig and hat seems to conduct a few short tunes in<br />
the wind; it seemingly having some form of directing effect upon the<br />
winds.</p>
<p>Soon the eye of the storms grew to encompass the whole of the<br />
tower.  Below in the courtyard it was complete bedlam, with<br />
anything that wasn&#8217;t nailed down, and something that were, flying about<br />
and crashing into things.  Suddenly a wooden house appeared in the<br />
sky out the top of the tornado; as it flew over castle Poppy a young<br />
girl in a blue dress clutching tightly to a small dog tumbled out one<br />
of the windows.  As she fell the winds buffeted them and tossed<br />
them around like straw, then from out of nowhere a passing witch who<br />
had been swept up into the winds crashed into her and knocked the small<br />
dog from her grasp.  As the witch steadied her flight and headed<br />
off back towards the distant forests the young girl and the little dog<br />
continued their fall towards the courtyard&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Black hair whipping and lashing in the strong wind, Hugh clutched to<br />
the safety harness, mentally noting that they would make an excellent<br />
garnish to a starter, perhaps weaving them into a bowl for a nice<br />
consommÈ...</p>
<p>He bellowed across at RuncibleSpoon who seemed to be equally at a loss for anything to do.</p>
<p>"I say, any idea when the tuba part&#039;s over? It&#039;s a bit blowy, wot?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Back on the tower the mighty chefs words billowed out into the wind<br />
lost in the roaring gale.   Across the roof Gustaffsen once<br />
more donned the wig and hat and danced over toward the first of the<br />
Puffball mushrooms, now at least a meter in diameter and looking ready<br />
to burst.  Taking a deep breath the great scientist moved his<br />
conductors baton to signal triple time and three whirling funnels or<br />
wind descended from the raging crashing whirlwind above and centred<br />
above each of the mushrooms.</p>
<p>As lightning flashed in the sky and thunder rumbled its way across the<br />
castle the great Scientist carefully reached out and gently tapped the<br />
bulging mushroom.  Suddenly with a audible Pfft noise a misty<br />
cloud rose from the mushroom.  Even as the spore cloud shot up the<br />
small funnel to be spread far and wide from the top of the great<br />
twister the mushroom began to collapse in on itself.  Chuckling to<br />
himself Gustaffsen practically danced his way towards the next mushroom<br />
where he quickly repeated the process; once more sending forth a great<br />
cloud to dissipate onto the air currents.  Finally he stepped up<br />
to the biggest mushroom room of all, its straining girth greater than<br />
either of the two precious fungi.  With a sure and steady<br />
Gustafssen reached his baton towards the sprouting body, its flesh<br />
rumbling and quavering with pent up tension.  As the tip of the<br />
baton made contact the world seamed to pause, the wind quietened,<br />
everything seemed to be suspended in midair, it was as if the whole of<br />
Fairy was waiting for something&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>&#8230;And then the mushroom burst.  Not with the loud pfft&#8217;s of the<br />
previous two but with a roaring boom that shattered window glass<br />
throughout the castle and deafening those exposed to it.  As the<br />
spores rushed outwards from the gigantic mushroom the cackling<br />
Gustafssen was thrown clear of the tower; as they cleared the top of<br />
the tower Hugh and the technician&#8217;s clutched air their harness vines<br />
for dear life.  Then with a loud organic snap one of the vines<br />
gave way and Hugh was thrown over the tower edge where the unfortunate<br />
chef was pulled up into the whirling maelstrom that was the twister&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>&#8230;As she fell the young girl in the blue dress was desperately trying<br />
once more to grab hold of her little dog when what looked like a<br />
manically grinning old man shot out of nowhere and collided with it and<br />
carried it off out of her sight.  Letting out a cry of petulant<br />
rage and frustrations she looked after her swiftly departing pet; so<br />
much was her attention focussed on her loss that she completely failed<br />
to notice the hard cobbled courtyard that she was fast<br />
approaching.  Luckily for the young girl the courtyard wasn&#8217;t so<br />
easily distracted from its current predicament and reminded her of its<br />
presence by halting her freefall in a very short, hard and almost<br />
terminal manner&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>...Hugh twisted and tumbled through the air, occasionally objects would<br />
loom out of the haze of flying leaves and dust and bounce off of him<br />
before carrying on their way.  Round and round he went, ever<br />
higher and ever faster.  &#8216;This,&#8217; he thought &#8216;must be what the<br />
meringue feels like.&#8217; And then the world about him began to thin and<br />
stretch and with a sudden pop he crossed the boarder...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>&#8230;Smoke rose from the crater as the fairies of castle Poppy gingerly<br />
approached it.  They had an idea of what was at the bottom of the<br />
hole as it had left many Gustafssen shaped holes in the walls as it<br />
passed through several of the towers, the main hall and many corridors<br />
and reception rooms before finally coming to its resting place buried<br />
deep in the castles wine cellars.  And this knowledge of who might<br />
be at the bottom of the hole only increased their anxiety.  After<br />
a whispered discussion a servant was bullied into looking over the edge<br />
as all the others dived behind what ever they could find.  As he<br />
reluctantly looked into the hole the young fairy could just make out<br />
the slightly charred and smoking form of Gustafssen frantically<br />
scribbling away at his note pad and muttering to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fantastic!  Almost exactly too plan.&#8221;  Then looking up at<br />
the white faced servant he said, &#8220;Gutten Tag.  Would you perhaps<br />
have a rope or a ladder with you?&#8221;  And then rummaging around<br />
behind him he pulled out a small squashed mess that once might have<br />
been a dog.  &#8220;Und do you know who&#8217;s this is?  It appears to<br />
have softened my fall but I don&#8217;t know what it might be.  Do you<br />
know if we have a giant rat problem?&#8221;</p>
<p>[<font>Private to GM:<font color="red"><br />
OOC:  There you go, one dies and one survives.  Okies feel<br />
free to take it from there.  Was talking to mark and we decided<br />
Hugh&#8217;s going to land in Disneyland somewhere.<br />
I guess that just leaves seeing how successful it all was.  :D<br />
 </font></font>]</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"A giant rat problem?" asked the servant.  "I&#039;m sure we don&#039;t Hugh<br />
would have...  Um, incidentally, Sir, was that Hugh that, er, shot<br />
up into the sky at high velocity?"</p>
<p>He paused for a moment.</p>
<p>"Right, I probably shouldn&#039;t have asked."</p>
<p>Turning to someone Gustafssen couldn&#039;t see, the servant called<br />
out.  "Jethro!  Go and fetch a ladder for Mister Gustafssen!"</p>
<p>After a few moments, the man who presumably was Jethro returned, and lowered a ladder down into the hole.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Gustafssen climbed out of the still smoking crater, his hair was<br />
singed, his lab coat damaged almost beyond repair with a soggy redish<br />
patch on its back and his skin had taken on a dirty Smokey charred look<br />
to it, but his enthusiasm hadn&#8217;t been dented on bit. &#8220;Danke mein<br />
Freund.  Would you be so kind as to take this Gequetschte<br />
Ratte-Sache to the cold storage units so as I can dissect it<br />
later.  If there is an infestation if is most vital we find some<br />
way to combat it quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then somewhat steadily Fairy&#8217;s greatest scientist made his way, with<br />
only a slight stagger, towards his laboratory to inspect the results of<br />
his latest experiments.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Back in the lab, Gustafssen had barely arrived when the doors behind<br />
him burst open with the force generated by a high-velocity ballistic<br />
maid.</p>
<p>"Good-morning-Mister-Gustafssen!" she blurted.<br />
"Mister-Nyano-sent-me-to-pay-your-bill-but-I&#039;m-going-to-need-your-dream-extracting-thingy!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Without even turning round Gustafssen, &#8220;Yes, yes my dear.<br />
RuncibleSpoon!  Do show the young lady where they are<br />
stored.&#8221;  Indicating the general direction with an absentminded<br />
wave of the hand.</p>
<p>Runciblespoon gently took the hyperactive maid by the arm and walked<br />
her towards one of the equipment storage bays. &#8220;Now what you want to<br />
remember is that a lot of this equipment is highly technical and that<br />
Mister Guastafssen is a Knocker.  So any strange and peculiar side<br />
effects are probably quite normal, and generally rarely fatal&#8230;&#8221;<br />
After a slight pause he continued, &#8220;If you run very fast in the<br />
opposite direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reaching the indicated locker he typed in his identification code,<br />
scanned his eyes, and gently fed a small carrot into the key<br />
hole.  Then with the sound of contented crunching the door swung<br />
neatly open.  Inside the locker there were racks and racks of what<br />
appeared to be colanders attached to large technical backpacks,<br />
complete with large shiny knobs, lights just begging to start flashing<br />
and a small wheel, by long multicoloured cables.  &#8220;Now all you<br />
need to do is place the colander over the head of the sleeper and the<br />
conductive cranial cabbage lining will do the extraction process.<br />
It&#8217;s actually quite simple really once you&#8217;ve read the training manual<br />
that is.&#8221;  As he said this he indicated the stack of what the maid<br />
had previously taken to be breezeblocks piled neatly next to the<br />
locker.  &#8220;It&#8217;s mostly a collection of recipes for soup that<br />
occurred to him whilst writing the manual, but he refuses to edit it<br />
down further and we simply haven&#8217;t had the time ourselves.  The<br />
only problem being that the instructions are mixed in with the various<br />
recipe methods.  So you might be reading about how you carefully<br />
blend down the broccoli with cream and the next step informs you of the<br />
consequences of over stimulation of the human brain.&#8221;</p>

<p>"Oh-right-then-I&#039;ll-be-very-careful!" announced the maid.  She<br />
glowed red for a second, then proceeded to pick up the arcane vegetable<br />
extravaganza in one hand and the manuals in the other.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mister Spoon," she said.  It was only after she&#039;d<br />
tottered out of the room, balancing the technology precariously, that<br />
those present finally noticed that she was speaking and acting at<br />
normal speed again...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Looking after the strange young woman, Runciblespoon muttered to<br />
himself, &#8220;I do hope she doesn&#8217;t do anything silly with it, the HHDP is<br />
a bit of a handful and heaven help her should she use it in the<br />
castle.  Perhaps I should have mentioned that to her.&#8221;  Then<br />
he turned away and headed back to his work bench.  As he walked he<br />
said as if in an after thought &#8220;Well it&#8217;s all in the manual&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;  Back in his lab once more Gustafssen was having a conversation with himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well we have the V-Team in place, and the Spores should be sprouting to life within the hour.  Now What have I missed?&#8221;</p>
<p>The sound of a pencil scribbling over paper rose from the bench in front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;True, true.  I will have What ever his name is run a full<br />
diagnostic of the OTC control unit.  But I swear there was<br />
something else&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more the sounds of scibbling filled the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mein Got!  You are right Mein unglaublich intelligenter und<br />
wundervoll scharfsinniger Freund!  Yes you are right we need a<br />
super secret spy, a master of disguise and a cowboy secret space<br />
detective super private eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more the pencil scribbles, the final full stop pressed so hard as to break the the pencils lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, our carbohydrate-laden friend.  He&#039;s just the man! though he&#039;s not even really a man.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>And with that he was off.  His journey took him into the very<br />
bowls of the Laboratory, passed the vaults of dreams, passed the<br />
compost bins, deep where few dared to tread.  Quietly and with<br />
confidence Fairylands greatest scientist by passed security systems,<br />
casually walked through death traps and waved enthusiastically at<br />
creatures that who&#8217;s visage would destroy the sanity of even the<br />
strongest minded individual.  Finally he reached a darkened,<br />
cobweb filled room.</p>
<p>As he entered the lighting turned on with a faint buzz and click, the<br />
glowing gherkins humming from disuse.  In the middle of the room<br />
stood a Mark 6 thermo zeitlicher Lokalisierung Schlauch, it&#8217;s<br />
cylindrical surface covered in a thick layer of dust and dirt.<br />
Approaching the device Gustafssen reached out and wiped off a patch of<br />
grime from the view port and looked in at the slowly roiling cloud of<br />
gas contained within.  Moving over to the control mechanism he<br />
picked up the key pad and started to press numbers whilst muttering to<br />
himself, &#8220;Mothers birthday, house number of first girlfriend, project<br />
code for the Manhattan project&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly with a loud metallic thunk and a hiss of excaping gas the tube<br />
hatch slid open.   Slowly as the gas and dust cloud cleared<br />
Gustafssen eyed one of his greatest and most feared creations and he<br />
smiled.</p>
<p>Das Ubertuber once more walked the realms of fairy&#8230;</p>

<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Whilst addressing the figure still partially concealed within the gas,<br />
dust and shadows the scientist sounded almost sane, &#8220;Welcome back mein<br />
st‰rkehaltiger Freund.  Your skills are once more needed, and this<br />
time the very nature of our realm hangs in the balance.  We&#8217;re<br />
glad to see your spell in the deep freeze has preserved you well. In<br />
fact we&#8217;d swear that you have gained an eighth of and inch or<br />
two.  We have taken the liberty of uploading the details of your<br />
mission into the computer of you MPHmobile, the wake up pulse has been<br />
sent to your base of operations and it will be once more up and<br />
functioning by the time you arrive.  If you have any questions you<br />
know how to contact us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking up at its master and creator Das Ubertuber nodded its<br />
understanding and turned and headed towards one of the stone walls<br />
where a section swung open to reveal a long dark corridor about ten<br />
inches high by ten inches wide.  Turning back to Gustafssen he<br />
winked and gave a thumbs up sign before heading off into the darkness.</p>
<p>As the small stone door swung shut gustafssen said to himselves, &#8220;Now<br />
let us go get some soup and wait for the information to start coming<br />
in.&#8221;  before turning and heading back towards the laboratory<br />
proper.</p>
<p>A short while later by the walled paddock known to the residents of<br />
Castle Poppy as the Vegetable Garden and its more apt name of &#8216;Certain<br />
Death&#8217; section of the rockery slowly moved aside to reveal a secret<br />
garage.  And curious pack of spring onions snuffling about near<br />
the entrance way were the only thing to take any notice as the Mr<br />
Potato Headmobile roared up the ramp and out towards Das Ubertuber&#8217;s<br />
super secret lair.</p>
<p><font color="red">OOC:  There we go that&#039;s all of it :)</font></p>

<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Striding into the dusty halls of his Super Secret Lair Das Uber Tuber<br />
punches the giant green button labled &#039;On&#039; and within moments the whole<br />
place is buzzing with the sound of computers and technology.  As<br />
systems start to run their dyagnostic programs he inserts a nutricious<br />
salad into fuel system before prepairing for his mission...</p>
<p>... Soon enough all is ready, his bags are packed and he&#039;s ready to go,<br />
the Mr Potatoe Headmobile waiting outside the door.  And then he&#039;s<br />
off to schmoose his way around fairy and investigate this new third<br />
party.  Rooting up turning over as many of their agents as he<br />
can.  A tubers got to do whata tuber&#039;s got to do!</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Returning to the main sections of his laboratory Gustaffsen retires to<br />
his study and avidly watches the Liquid Carrot Display screens as the<br />
information from his fungusses starts rolling in.</p>
