<p>Ah, home sweet home...  Or rather, lab sweet lab.</p>
<p>Or rather, "oh, no..."</p>
<p>What was once your &#039;creatively organised&#039; laboratory is now creatively disorganised.  Or, more to the point, smashed up.</p>
<p>At some point in the last few years, some invading army or other must<br />
have decided that the lab would be a good place to loot, and a couple<br />
of soldiers clearly set about looking for interesting and valuable<br />
things.  Common idiots that they were, of course, they didn&#039;t<br />
realise the genius of many of your creations and merely broke them<br />
instead.  Still, at least the technology didn&#039;t fall into enemy<br />
hands.</p>
<p>Not for long, anyway.</p>
<p>The reason for it being likely that it was a couple of soldiers who<br />
ransacked the place is that there are currently two soldiers passed out<br />
on the floor.  Their close proximity to a bunch of iron spikes<br />
suggests that they will probably not return from this state.  As<br />
does the puddle of dried blood around them.</p>
<p>At least you can be thankful that your security system worked.<br />
The good old faithful, the big red button entitled "Do Not Press", is<br />
still depressed by the weight of one of the soldiers&#039; now limp hands.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>"Mein Got!  You step outside for a breath of fresh air..."</p>
<p>Looking around his once beautiful lab Gustafssen slowly takes<br />
stock.  His prototype glamourificator was smashed beyond repair,<br />
the automated bath-bed appeared to be only mildly dented, but then it<br />
had never worked anyway...</p>
<p>Stuck by a sudden rememberance of those last days in the castle he<br />
cried, "My Baby!" as he rushed to one of his work benches.<br />
Shifting aside piles of broken piping and shattered glass he saw a<br />
small crack in the stones behind.  Slipping in his little finger<br />
he flicked open the pannel, the sight than greated him was one the<br />
greatly saddened him, instead of the healthy green glow of his hidden<br />
freshenator he found only the dull greyness of its crumpled form. &#039;So,&#039;<br />
he thought, &#039;Someone has found it and taken it.&#039;  Stalking over to<br />
the innert bodies on the floor he begins to inspect them, idley and<br />
without thought his hand slips into the breast pocket of his lab coat<br />
pulling out his note book and begins to take notes...</p>
<p>...&#039;Hmmmmm the look of terror and pain upon their faces indicates to me that they died slowly and in pain, which is good.</p>
<p>Subject A appears to have taken most of his damage from the spikes,<br />
this is indicated by the multiple penetration marks that are obvious on<br />
both his body and armour.  A classic example of the style of death<br />
happily refered to by those in the know as &#039;Well and truly Nailed&#039;</p>
<p>Subject B appears to be clutching some form of food stuff which is in<br />
an advanced stage of decomposition, and has only taken minor damage<br />
from the spikes; but whilst to the brief viewing these seem only to be<br />
the minorest of wounds anyone with an ounce of inteligence or knowledge<br />
would know that, whilst painful, they would not be enough to over come<br />
such a creature.  Which suggests that that something else has<br />
caused the fatality... Ahhh yes, a very close inspection of subject B<br />
shows that their skin, clothes and armour are all pockmarked with<br />
minute perferations; and as expected the areas of penetration a<br />
surrounded with slight scorch marks.  In all I conclude that<br />
Subject B fell victim to the FerusInfernum device.  It should be<br />
noted that this previously untested device appears to function within<br />
its peramiters and cause extream torment to its victims, as can be<br />
noted by the twisted nature of the victims limbs, the large amounts of<br />
dried blood on the floor and the scrape marks that can be seen in the<br />
broken objects surounding the body.  The subject also<br />
appeared to have taken a beating as there are a number of broken bones<br />
and his armour is dented, I surmise that these dents and breaks were<br />
administered some time after the demise of Subject B.  The exact<br />
number of these wounds is hard to tell as they seem to increase with<br />
each count, perhaps this is something that requires further study.&#039;...</p>
<p>... "Who took it, where is it!  Which unknowing oaf has taken my<br />
baby!!!"  Bending over the fairy scientist pears closly at the<br />
bodies of the dead.  "Ahhh ha!  You card! you bounder!<br />
You absalout moron.  How dare you steal it how dare you take it.<br />
Do you know how long i&#039;ve been looking forward to seeing that<br />
again!  It was an item of pure genius, a delight to saver and<br />
experiance.  But you had to find its hiding place and take<br />
it.  And then you had the gaul to go and get killed before eating<br />
it leaving it to rot here, untasted, unloved unexperianced.  That<br />
was much lunch you &#039;Sandwich, das bastard stiehlt!!!&#039;" witheach new<br />
pronuncment a vicious metal reinforced boot was applied to one of the<br />
recumberant bodies...</p>
<p>...&#039;N.B. In conclusion,&#039; finished the notes,  &#039;the FerusInfernum<br />
device seems to be the ideal item for dealing with sandwich stealing<br />
scum.</p>
<p>N.B. Suggest a scaled down versions, a field defence version, a larder<br />
defence version and a lunchbox sized version for issue to soldiers on<br />
campaign.  This should prevent any unauthorised aquisition of<br />
field rations from both the quarter master and fellow soldiers.</p>
<p>N.B. Perhaps it might be worth doing a tiny sweet packet sized<br />
version.  Might help find out who has been stealing my mint<br />
humbugs...&#039;</p>
<p>...Rant concluded Gustaffsen calls over his shoulder<br />
"Runciblespoon!  Schrodinger!  Heisenberg!  Errrr what<br />
ever your name is...!  Come here and clean up this mess up.<br />
Take them to the EM room and if it is still in working order remove any<br />
residual iron and and once you&#039;ve got every last micro scopic piece out<br />
of them then dump these dumb bastards somewhere, the dung heap, the<br />
game reserve, the kitchen larder, I don&#039;t care where just get them out<br />
of my lab!"</p>
<p>With that done he set about tidying his laboratory.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As the long, slow tidying process gets underway, helped on-and-off by<br />
Schrodinger and to some unfathomable extent by Heisenberg, the most<br />
truly disastrous result of the lab&#039;s sacking becomes apparent.</p>
<p>The potato cage lies twisted and mangled on the ground behind one of<br />
the benches, its wire frame splayed open and its former contents no<br />
longer present.  Thick trails pierce the dust on the floor in a<br />
curved line between the cage and a mouse-hole in the skirting<br />
board.  A mouse-hole that seems to have been hollowed out with the<br />
use of heavy-duty tools that still lie discarded near to the hole.</p>
<p>It looks like pretty good workmanship.  For a potato, at least.</p>
<p>Still, an impressive craftsman on the loose isn&#039;t the problem.<br />
There&#039;s an entire tribe of potatoes on the loose, and they could be<br />
anywhere!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Suddenly from the depths of the lad a sound echos forth... "OH- golly<br />
Mann! Der Kartoffel haben diesem ist ein Unfall! entgangen!!!!!"<br />
Swiftly followed by the loud thunk of a head hitting solid oak.<br />
"Bummeln Sie!"</p>
<p>After quietly sitting on the lab floor for a few minutes whilst<br />
furiously rubbing his head Gustaffsen takes out his note book and<br />
starts writing...</p>
<p>...&#039;The potato cage was obviously broken sometime ago, probably during<br />
the general ransacking that the two deceased soldiers gave the place,<br />
which means that they could be anywhere.</p>
<p>The loss of these potato&#039;s puts a sevear strain upon resources, I only<br />
have a small supply of potatoes left from those I managed to take with<br />
me during the evacuation.  I will have to initiate a cultivation<br />
program quickly to rectify this matter.  I do hope the hydroponics<br />
beds are undamaged.</p>
<p>On the other hand this escape provides an interesting research<br />
opportunity, how have the potato&#039;s evolved and adapted in their new<br />
environments.  No vegetable has ever been seen outside their<br />
natural surroundings of the Lab, I should form a research and<br />
investigation unit to tack and find this lost group.</p>
<p>As it stands these evolved potato&#039;s or EP&#039;s seem to have become quite<br />
the craftsmen.  They appear to have utilised the equipment, tools<br />
and resources in the lab to fashion some forms of advanced<br />
technologies.  The examples of the tools left by the hole suggest<br />
refinement in craftsmanship and some thought of forward planning.<br />
There is evidence within the hole that the walls have been shored up<br />
with boards and ever decorated to an extent.</p>
<p>This makes the forming of a research party all the more<br />
necessary.  Now I could possibly employ some of the smaller fair<br />
folk.  Perhaps some of the more stable minded pictzies might<br />
do.  But then they&#039;re more likely to attack the watch and<br />
observe.  Obviously the only solution is to use vegetables,<br />
they&#039;re reliable, inteligent and highly useful things.  Not to<br />
mention chock full of vitamins and minerals.  Yes, the group<br />
should consist of 2 potatoes, 3 carrots, 3 sprouts and a full pod of<br />
peas to act as sherpa&#039;s&#039;...</p>
<p>...returning his note book to his pocket the Fae professor heads into<br />
the deeper sections of his laboratory to retrieve the necessary<br />
exploration and adventure dream serums from cold storage.  "Errrr<br />
what ever your name is...!  Run down to the kitchen and see if<br />
Hugh can spare a pod of peas and 3 or 4 sprouts all raw<br />
obviously.  No don&#039;t ask why just run."</p>
<p>[<font>Private to GM: Original before babel fish took hold of it:<br />

<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>A few minutes later, Whatever-his-name-is returns at a run and out of breath.</p>
<p>"Sorry," he pants.  "It&#039;s the macroscopic deterministic nature of<br />
my journey duration, it gets me every time!"  The man stops for a<br />
few more lungfuls of air, before holding out the contents of his hands<br />
to the Professor.</p>
<p>"I&#039;ve not had an awful lot of luck, I&#039;m afraid.  No carrots, you<br />
see, and apparently there haven&#039;t been peas for years!  But<br />
luckily for us, there&#039;s still the stuff that <i>nobody</i> in their right mind would eat!"</p>
<p>So saying, he hands Gustaffsen four sprouts, a fairly sorry-looking floret of cauliflower, and most of an aubergine.</p>
<p>"I hope that&#039;s okay, Professor.  It might have to do, though,<br />
because the kitchen up there in in uproar!  There&#039;s potatoes<br />
running all over the place!"</p>
<p>"Mein Gott!" Gustaffsen replies.  "Zey haff already got zat<br />
far?  Right, take zese vegetables, and power up ze Super Fast<br />
Evolve-o-Matic Ray!"</p>
<p>[<font>Private to<br />
Gustafssen: Guessed at Gustaffsen&#039;s reaction, just so you know you do<br />
have a super-fast whatever.  If Gustaffsen&#039;d do something<br />
different, let me know and I&#039;ll edit.</font>]</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>"Kommt zu, kein korrektes Versorgungsmaterial Gem¸se, was die ist Welt,<br />
die wenn eine Fee nicht die lebenswichtigen Versorgungsmaterialien f¸r<br />
ein Experiment erhalten kann. Wenn ich nicht achtgebe, mu? ich jemand<br />
zum Gem¸seflecken heraus schicken, um einiges zur¸ckzuholen und wohl<br />
wissen wir, was letztes Mal geschah, das erfolgt war."</p>
<p>Muttering to himself Gustaffsen finds the appropriate painting, a still<br />
life bowl of fruit, and gently depresses the tomato whilst making sure<br />
to keep his fingers out of reach of the bunch of grapes. &#039;I really<br />
should create a new locking painting this one never seemed to work<br />
quite right.  I mean it was supposed to be a landscape...&#039; he<br />
thinks to himself idly as the picture swings open revealing the smoking<br />
depths of a deep freeze.</p>
<p>After selecting the correct vials of serum the scientist moves to one<br />
of the few potato cages that he had managed to take with him in the<br />
evacuation.  The cage contained a rumbling mass covered by a piece<br />
of heavy sacking, which as he approached quietened down and stopped<br />
moving.  As he opened the cage many small starch filled eyes<br />
stared up at him expectantly.  "I am looking for two volunteers to<br />
lead an expedition into the very bowls of the castle in search of your<br />
lost kin who were left behind.  They have been living wild within<br />
the castle and I wish to find them, study them and make contact.<br />
You will of course be augmented and equipped appropriately for the<br />
expedition.  So could any who are willing please make themselves<br />
known."</p>
<p>Slowly and with very little fuss two potatoes embraced those around<br />
them and stepped to the fore of the cage to signal their willingness to<br />
participate.  "Ahhh thank you Meine Freunde."  Then scooping<br />
up the potatoes and depositing them in the deep pockets of his lab coat<br />
he closed the cage and headed for the Super Fast Evolve-o-Matic Ray<br />
room.</p>
<p>Placing the potatoes down next to the other vegetables retrieved from<br />
the kitchen Gustaffsen removes a set of syringes from his breast pocket<br />
and proceeds to inject each of them with a precise cocktail of dream<br />
serums.  A heavy dose of adventure, a small spot of investigation,<br />
a tad of egotism, a good dollop of dress sense and of course lashings<br />
and lashings of exploration with a slight hint of caution and cunning.</p>
<p>This done the Fae scientist places the vegetables underneath the giant<br />
spiky point of the Super Fast Evolve-o-Matic Ray and steps back<br />
lowering his goggles.<br />
"Errr What ever your name is.  Raise the lightning rods! Fire up<br />
the sonic occilators!!  Crank the Newtonian compensators 3<br />
notches!!!  Initiate the Pseudoscientific sprocket field!!!! And<br />
throw the switch on my mark!!!!!</p>
<p>5...<br />
As he started the countdown a wining started to build within the lab.<br />
4...<br />
Multi coloured lightning began to flash around the room, grounding on<br />
various objects and leaving blackend scorch marks and in their wake.<br />
3...<br />
As the noise built up objects started to bounce about the tables<br />
clattering and occasionally a beaker would crash to the floor in a<br />
crystalline tinkle.<br />
2...<br />
As the light and sound crashed around the room the flashed of thousands<br />
of tiny eyes that were watching from the cracks in the floor walls and<br />
ceiling.<br />
1...MARK!!!!!!</p>
<p>As Whatever-his-name-is slammed down the switch there was a great<br />
roaring noise and suddenly the world flashed and pulsated<br />
monochrome.  A giant explosion of wind rushed through the room,<br />
out through the lab blowing dust and small creatures out and down<br />
through the corridors of the castle.  Through it all Gustaffsen<br />
stands there arms crossed intently watching through his protective<br />
goggles and cackling like a madman.</p>
<p>As the power once more subsided he removed his goggles and approached the vegetables.  "Now let us see the results..."</p>
<p>[<font>Private to Storyteller:</font></p>
<p>What he&#039;s actually saying:<br />
No proper supply of vegetables, what is the world coming to when a<br />
fairy can&#039;t get the vital supplies for an experiment.  If I&#039;m not<br />
careful I&#039;ll have to send someone out to the vegetable patch to<br />
retrieve some and well we know what happened last time that was done.</p>
<p>OKies I was thinking that the potatoes should come out something like<br />
Indiana Jones, they can even have developed the hat, jacket and whip<br />
already.  The Sprouts are intended to be the muscle and the guys<br />
with the recording and transmitting equipment.  The other two i&#039;m<br />
not too sure so feel free to let your imagination run.]</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>To most of the civilised world, the concept of a sprout saluting is not<br />
a concept that comes readily to mind or one that is easily visualised.</p>
<p>To Gustaffsen, of course, this is an almost everyday occurrence.</p>
<p>The potatoes both emerge sporting leather hats and whips, and one of<br />
them has already set to experimenting by using its whip to swing from<br />
apparata around the lab.  The sprouts, for their part, line up and<br />
- yes - salute.  Even without arms.  Arms are so passe these<br />
days.</p>
<p>They are followed slowly from the Evolve-o-Matic equipment by the two<br />
remaining vegetables: An aubergine that seems to be tattooed with<br />
symbols that Gustaffsen fails to recognise as anything but &#039;probably<br />
eldritch, unless that means sort-of-oblong&#039;, and the floret of<br />
cauliflower - now adorned with a belt of explosives, several grenades<br />
and a backback full of dynamite.</p>
<p>Now he examines the aubergine closer, it appears to be holding a staff with a knob on the end nonchalantly behind his back.</p>
<p>The experiment seems to have been a success, although a predictably<br />
unpredictable one.  Gustaffsen&#039;s version 2 private army is ready<br />
and waiting to march!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>"Begr¸?en Sie meine kleinen Gem¸sefreunde."  Says the Fae as he<br />
addresses the assembled vegetables, subconsciously ripping off a<br />
perfect salute in reply to the sprouts.  "I am glad to see that<br />
the process has once more worked out perfectly.  Now if you could<br />
gather round I will inform you of the reason for this assembly"</p>
<p>Quickly the vegetables gather on the workbench in front of their<br />
creator, the Potatoes quickly moving to the front whilst the aubergine<br />
seeming to hang back slightly.  From somewhere about its person<br />
the cauliflower produces a cigar, leaning across it strikes a match of<br />
the knob of the aubergine&#039;s staff and lights the tightly rolled<br />
tobacco.  As the eldritch clad vegetable edges away the cauli<br />
blows a cloud of smoke from its tightly packed white buds into its face<br />
causing the aubergine to cough and splutter in a way that only a<br />
vegetable can.</p>
<p>"Now, now that is enough larking about you two.  It is time I gave<br />
your mission briefing."  This said the Professor pulls out a<br />
clipboard before continuing.  "Now the mission which you have so<br />
gallantly chosen to accept is a simple one, you will travel into the<br />
deepest darkest recesses of the castle in search of..."  Suddenly<br />
a loud squeak issues forth from the pack of vegetable matter.  All<br />
that remains of the aubergine is a pair of wooden sandals, a staff<br />
still spinning in the air and a quickly retreating dust cloud heading<br />
out into the laboratory.  "...Stop that vegetable!!!"</p>
<p>For five minutes the aubergine continues its escape, twisting and<br />
dodging between equipment and table legs, never once looking back<br />
towards those following it only forward, before eventually being<br />
brought down by a well placed whip.  Whereupon it was jumped on by<br />
the sprouts and frog marched back to the workbench.</p>
<p>Picking up the reluctant vegetable Gustaffsen examines it<br />
closely.  &#8220;It is nice to see that you are so eager to get on with<br />
the missions, but perhaps you should wait for the rest of the<br />
briefing.  That way you will know exactly what it is that you must<br />
do and what dangers you will be facing.&#8221;  At these words the<br />
purple creature starts struggling and squeaking.  &#8220;You are an over<br />
excited one are you not.&#8221;  Placing the purple fruit back on the<br />
wooded surface he turns to the potatoes, &#8220;You will have to keep a close<br />
eye on him, for I fear that otherwise he will hare off in search of<br />
adventure without you.&#8221;  Nodding the potatoes signal to two of the<br />
sprouts who march forward and place themselves in close proximity to<br />
their &#8216;eager&#8217; friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now where was I? Ahhhh yes, once you have entered the tunnel network<br />
that runs through the castle you must seek out and research a tribe of<br />
potatoes who have been living wild within these walls these past<br />
years.  My initial notes will be programmed into the data slates<br />
that you will all be issued with, as well as some hypothesises as to<br />
what might have occurred to them.  Once you have conducted some<br />
initial research you should make friendly contact and then bring<br />
delegation back here to talk with me.&#8221;  Moving to another part of<br />
the bench he picks up a small pile of satchels and backpacks, here is<br />
your equipment.  Inside you will find your data slates, recording<br />
and transmission equipment, supplies and some methods of protection;<br />
these are a selection of both lethal and non-lethal, I request only<br />
non-lethal means be used against the potatoes and then only at extreme<br />
need.  Should you need instant evacuation activate your homing<br />
beacons and I will transport you back to the lab, but once more these<br />
should only be used in direst need.  As the technology still has<br />
one or two bugs that need working out.  Now I believe that is all<br />
for now, it is time for the mission to get underway.  Gentleveg,<br />
that mission that you are undertaking is of vital importance to both<br />
Vegetable and Faekind. Gottgeschwindigkeit&#8221;</p>
<p>As they marched off into the enlarged mouse hole each vegetable saluted<br />
their creator in their own way, and it seemed to the Fae scientist that<br />
the aubergine got a little over excited, squeaking and thrashing about,<br />
but luckily the sprouts kindly helped it through the opening.<br />
Though unfortunately their grip seemed to fail at the last moment and<br />
the eggplant was sent flying into the darkness beyond.</p>
<p>As Gustaffsen turned away from the mouse hole he thought to himself,<br />
&#8216;How strange, I could have sworn that those sigils when in the half<br />
light almost spelt something, but then &#8216;Wizzard&#8217; isn&#8217;t a real<br />
word.  I must be imagining things in my old age.&#8217;  And then<br />
putting such thoughts from his mind he moved off into his lab to work.</p>
<p>[<font>Private to Storyteller:<br />
German translation:</font></p>
<p>1) Welcome my little vegetable friends.<br />
2) God Speed  ]</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As Gustaffsen settles down to work, a series of resounding clangs, one<br />
heavy thump and the sounds of arguing vegetables echo from various<br />
parts of the walls as the vitamin-rich army begins to get to grips with<br />
its new surroundings.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, the noises fade and are gone, the vegetables having begun their mission in earnest.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Satisfied that the V team, as he thought of them, were well underway<br />
Gustaffsen turned his mind to more important scientific matters.<br />
Such as where exactly in the deep storage vaults had he stored the case<br />
of stout he had planned to give to Hugh for his &#8216;birthday&#8217; and whether<br />
its armour plating of augmented cabbage leaves had withstood the test<br />
of time.  As he moved off towards the vaults his hands reached<br />
into his pockets to withdraw his note book, and started to write.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Gustaffsen walked on autopilot in the direction of the cellars, barely<br />
looking up from his notebook as he traversed the familiar route.<br />
There were fewer servants down here than there ought to be, what with<br />
the steadily mounting potato hunt upstairs, and the scientist past only<br />
two on his way.</p>
<p>However, just as he turned the last corner before the vault he was<br />
heading for, he all but collided with a girl whose attention was fixed<br />
firmly on a notebook of her own.</p>
<p>The black-haired girl looked up, stunned for a moment, then flicked quickly through her book.</p>
<p>"Ah," she said, with a voice that sounded as adorned with lace as her dress was, "Gustaffsen, yes?"</p>
<p>Without waiting for the scientist&#039;s confirmation or otherwise, she<br />
continued.  "I don&#039;t suppose you could point me in the direction<br />
of the throne room, could you?  I seem to be a little lost..."</p>
<p>[<font>The girl&#039;s picture is the one backed with purple-to-black on the character roster.</font>]</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>"Hmmm what was that you say?  Throne room?"  Even as he spoke his hands were once more moving across his note book...</p>
<p>&#039;Notes concerning young fairy encounters in the vaults:</p>
<p>- Interesting taste in clothing, dark purples, blues and blacks.  Perhaps she&#039;s sad, or perhaps it&#039;s some new fashion.</p>
<p>- Seems confused, wasn&#039;t looking where she was going.  Most probably day dreaming over some young fellow me lad or another.</p>
<p>- Carries an umbrella, useful item.  Though could be improved<br />
through used of lettuce.  Keeps the rain off whilst also providing<br />
a renewable and healthy snack into the bargain. - Must consider this<br />
later...&#039;</p>
<p>"Young lady Might I enquire why you decide to bother a man of science<br />
with such mundane things as directions.  There are servants about<br />
somewhere for such things as this you know.  If not there are the<br />
little Arrows that I placed all over the castle before the evacuation<br />
for help in locations."</p>
<p>This said he reached out and touched a little red arrow that was<br />
attached to a wall.  Suddenly the arrow sprang into 3D and pointed<br />
directly at Gustaffsen&#039;s feet before saying in the most happy, bouncy<br />
and helpful voice &#039;Greetings.  You are here!  Thank you for<br />
using the location finder mark 3 arrow.  Have a nice day.&#039;</p>
<p>"See it tells you all that you can ever want to know if you are<br />
lost.  Still I guess not everyone knows about them.  But if<br />
you must know the Throne room is down the hall, up the second stairs on<br />
your left and straight on.  At which point you must pass through<br />
the hall of moons, take the ladder of suns up two floors at which point<br />
you will come to one of the main corridors, from where I think someone<br />
should be able to assist you further.  Obviously you&#039;d have been<br />
able to get there much quicker is the Duchess had allowed me to fit the<br />
&#039;Uber sucko tube hyper speed transportation system&#039; but apparently it<br />
was two dangerous.  I mean it had only turned 5 test subjects into<br />

sure I&#039;d have had it fully fixed before it was 100% operational.<br />
Still some people just don&#039;t understand the genius of some objects."</p>
<p>Finally as he stopped talking he looked down at his note book where a<br />
perfect sketch of the girl had somehow appeared on the paper along with<br />
various anatomical notations, "Oh my.  Still I hope that answers<br />
your question?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>One flick of Gustaffsen&#039;s eyes down to his notebook, then up again -<br />
and the girl was gone.  A faint whisper of a "Thank You" hangs in<br />
the air, but there is no sign of the girl herself besides the patterns<br />
in the dust on the floor.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Who? What? Hmmmm?  Oh ok.&#8221; Gustaffsen said to the empty space in front of him. &#8220;Well that was fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then he was off again, the whole incident completely<br />
forgotten.  Finally he reached the vault that he required but as<br />
he tried to stop he found that his legs just carried straight on past<br />
it and started carrying him back out of the vaults.  &#8220;How<br />
peculiar,&#8221; he said to himself as he found himself once more standing at<br />
the spot he had briefly stopped at a few minutes before.  &#8220;Well I<br />
guess this means I&#8217;ve got something on my mind.  Go on, what is<br />
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then his hands brought his note book up to his face and scribbled, &#8216;Who was she?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was who?&#8221; he replied to the pad.</p>
<p>&#8216;That girl who you spoke to here.&#8217; His hands scribbled on the pad, then<br />
the page flicked backwards to the picture and note he&#8217;d sketched at the<br />
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well what about her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Doesn&#8217;t it strike you as odd to find her wandering lost about down here?&#8217; His hands continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;No not really, the servants are always getting lost down here.  I<br />
even once heard that some even starved to death before finding their<br />
way out.  Silly really cause some of the mould that grows down<br />
here is rather tasty, and very good for you too.  In fact I once<br />
made a rather nice chutn&#8230;&#8221;  With a sudden thump, his note pad hit<br />
him on the nose.</p>
<p>&#8216;Stop digressing and CONCENTRATE&#8217;. Demanded his hands on the note pad<br />
once it had returned from its brief journey to his face. &#8216;She wasn&#8217;t a<br />
servant, you know all the servants in the castle by sight, and pretty<br />
much all the nobles too.  So think about it, Who was she?<br />
And what was she doing here?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mein Gott, haben Sie Recht!  I think perhaps we should go and<br />
investigate, or at least tell someone.  It would also give me a<br />
chance to pick up something to eat from the kitchen too.&#8221;  And<br />
with that he marches off to the upper floors of the castle, pausing on<br />
his journey briefly to shout back down in to the vaults.<br />
&#8220;Schrodinger!   Heisenberg! Can one of you take that case out<br />
of the vault for me!  Thank you!&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Gustaffsen headed up through the castle, following the directions he&#039;d<br />
given the girl.  Up staircases and along corridors he raced in an<br />
attempt to catch her, but even after several minutes of running he had<br />
still not seen hide nor hair of her.</p>
<p>Pausing by a window to catch his breath, the old scientist gazed out<br />
across the courtyard and took in the sights of the evening sunlight,<br />
the green hills stretching to the horizon, the angry mob at the bottom<br />
of the tower...</p>
<p>...Angry mob?</p>
<p>A group of nobles and a hundred or so servants were gathered at the<br />
bottom of one of the castle&#039;s towers, some carrying weapons and some<br />
carrying signs and placards.  One enterprising youth even seemed<br />
to be carrying one of House Poppy&#039;s battle standards.</p>
<p>Gustaffsen scanned up the tower itself until he noticed the window<br />
three floors up - where two potatoes stood on the windowsill, trying to<br />
reload a crossbow.  At the moment he saw them, they must have seen<br />
him too.  They shared a guilty look for a fraction of a second,<br />
and disappeared from the windowsill leaving their crossbow behind.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, a tiny potatoey arm reached up and pulled the crossbow back inside the room as well.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As you watch the crowd down below try without success to beat down the<br />
door, a moment&#039;s silence falls.  Then, with a terribly slow<br />
stone-against-stone creak, the top of the tower *unfurls*.  The<br />
stone walls peeled away, the topmost floor of the tower is now open to<br />
the sky.</p>
<p>The room&#039;s contents, unidentifiably weird to those in the mob below who<br />
now stand with their eyes fixed upwards, are well-known enough to<br />
you.  That tower, being the tallest in the castle, had always been<br />
the obvious choice of location for the Mk. 4 Wettersteuervorrichtung...</p>
<p>From your high vantage point, you can see the lone potato standing on the control panel.  It&#039;s grinning.</p>
<p><font color="red">OOC: Wettersteuervorrichtung = Weather Control Device</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>As the tower opens and the Mk. 4 Wettersteuervorrichtung unfolds in all<br />
its glory Gustaffsen mutters to himself, &#8220;Das is wonderful, the<br />
mechanism is still working after all this time.  It just goes to<br />
show that when the oil is impregnated with all the vitamin and juicy<br />
goodness of the garden wonders will never cease.&#8221;  Suddenly down<br />
below the crowd started to scatter in varying directions like scared<br />
mice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahhh it is nice to see that people a so interested in my work that<br />
they move off to get a better look at it.  It gives one a feeling<br />
of ‰u?ern Sie Contentment, der durch Ihren Kasten wie eine warme<br />

<p>It was then that the small movement caught his eye, a small potatoe<br />
standing at the control panel.  &#8220;OH- lieb, OH- lieb. Dieses kann<br />
nicht an allen gut, nicht gut sein.  Doesn&#8217;t the little thing know<br />
that the vortex gear coupling was weak, activating that device could<br />
cause no end of trouble.&#8221; Stammered the scientist.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8216;Exactly!&#8217; Concurred the writing on his note pad.  &#8216;And due to<br />
the solari-wind collector panels none of the unenlightened below will<br />
know that something is seriously wrong.  This can mean only one<br />
thing&#8230;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes that is correct.  One great mind must combine&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;&#8230;and become One great mind!&#8217; And with that the notebook and pencil<br />
flew into his top pocket, and there stood the noted fairy scientist;<br />
his hair its normal wild and unkempt self  and then at the exact<br />
centre of his head it was as if it were another head entirely.<br />
The long white hair sat all neatly cleaned and combed back and a slight<br />
scent of hair oil pervaded the air about it.  Then his hands<br />
started rummaging about the many pockets of his coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must get over to the tower as soon as possible,&#8221; &#8216;Yes, it is a pity<br />
we do not have time to head back to the lab.&#8217; &#8220;Yes that is true, still<br />
I think we have what we need.&#8221; Gustaffsen discussed with himself, his<br />
voice somehow different yet the same.</p>
<p>Quickly a small pile was established on the sill in front of him.<br />
With over exaggerated care he removed a small vile of liquid from a<br />
reinforced leather wallet and emptied the contents into a bottle of<br />
carrot juice.  &#8216;Yes the refined Sportyness from that vile will<br />
combine nicely with the pure healthy goodness in the juice.&#8217; &#8220;Yes but<br />
there needs to be a catalyst to kick start the process, this isn&#8217;t<br />
optical physics you know.  This is actually hard,&#8221;  Then a<br />
hand snaked out to the pile and removed a brightly shining sliver<br />
liberty dollar coin which he then proceeds to crumble the coin into the<br />
juice. &#8216;Ahhhh you read your mind&#8230;&#8217;  Suddenly the bottle starts to<br />
jump and thrash about madly giving off a energetic glowing light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well here&#8221; &#8216;goes nothing.&#8217;  He says before snatching up the juice and swilling it back in one smooth swallow.</p>
<p>Suddenly a sweatband appeared upon Gustaffsens weathered brow, a piece<br />
of paper with the number 275 pins itself to the front of his lab coat,<br />
and under his coat his shirt and trousers morph into shorts and a light<br />
t-shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well that was interesting&#8221; &#8216;yes it was, still here goes<br />
nothing.&#8217;  And with that he launches himself off of the windowsill<br />
in a perfect vault and soars out into the open air over the courtyard;<br />
all the time his eyes focused on the window in the tower where the<br />
archers had been short moments.  Then with a gentle thump his foot<br />
connects with its target and he rolls forward inside the tower, shortly<br />
coming to his feet and ready to run.</p>

One hundred an fifty pounds of narked Geordie!"<br />
"... What?"</p>
<p>And shortly after that, 150lbs of "narked Geordie" were flung from the<br />
upstairs window of an innocuous looking tower, over the amazed people<br />
amassed on the courtyard to land on the tower with the weather control<br />
device, within hailing distance of Gustaff.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Gustaffsen barrel-rolls in through the window of the tower two storeys<br />
below the new roof level, the perfect figure of supple agility and<br />
athletic prowess - for another three seconds, before the effect of the<br />
potion wears off and returns him to his normal self.  Ahead of<br />
him, the door to the stairwell is being rapidly pulled shut by a dozen<br />
or so potatoes who are squeaking in alarm.  In their haste to<br />
escape they have left their crossbow lying on the windowsill.</p>
<p>And, as Gustaffsen notices this, he also notices what&#039;s beyond the<br />
windowsill - one very large Geordie, following a neat ballistic arc<br />
across the courtyard.  With a shout of something barely<br />
pronouncable and almost certainly unrepeatable, the man lands with a<br />
crash inside the room, bringing the stone edges of the window with him<br />
and raising a plume of dust from the floor.</p>
<p>When Gustaffsen stops coughing and looks up again, the door has already<br />
been closed by the potatoes.  The new arrival is already standing<br />
and looking around.  He focusses on Gustaffsen.</p>
<p>"Reet then," he says, "wha&#039; them buggers go?"</p>

<p>From the top of the tower a loud throbbing sound starts to make itself<br />
heard, first through the feet, then through the ears, then seemingly<br />
directly into the brain.</p>
<p>As the pitch and frequency of the noise rises, the air begins to take<br />
on a strange consistency - still air-like, but consisting of tiny<br />
independent vibrations that feel odd against the skin.  Kind of<br />
like standing in gaseous facial scrub soap, in fact.</p>

<p>Taking a good look around the room, he grabs the small crossbow and<br />

the only door out of the room.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, down below on the courtyard, Laurel and Hardy continue to<br />
debate the possible existence of a flying geordie superdinosaur - with<br />
optional wings. They&#039;ve just reached the point where Laurel had<br />
finished a masterful explanation of why a superdinosaur would be<br />
impossible "Because they&#039;re all colourblind, see, so wouldn&#039;t know<br />
whether it was a yellow sun or not!" when the potatocrossbow strikes<br />
him forcefully on the head in a highly slapstick - but definitely<br />
nonlethal - fashion. And then fires, as he reaches up to rub himself<br />
ruefully on the head.</p>
<p>The Goerdie, having ascertained that the door is locked, turns to his<br />
companion in the room who seems to have stopped talking for the moment.</p>
<p>"Reet, ahm ganin tuh open this heor door. yee wark yeut wot is happenin tuh the choonched air, alreet? Canny sonny."</p>

<p>As Gustaffsen switched worlds, it took him a few moments to adjust to<br />
his new surroundings.  Whilst there were still walls around him -<br />
on two sides, at least - and a door in front of him, it was all a<br />
lot... <i>pinker</i> than Castle Poppy&#039;s tower had been.  And more plasticky.</p>
<p>In fact, the lack of walls on two sides began to be quite<br />
alarming.  It was a long drop to the ground below, and that ground<br />
was crowded with people.  Most of whom were staring up at him, and<br />
those that weren&#039;t seemed young and distracted by some variety of giant<br />
malformed animals.</p>
<p>A few staffish-looking humans on the ground seemed to be trying to<br />
convince the others that Gustaffsen was supposed to be there and not<br />
crazy or suicidal, but they were not having much success.</p>
<p>Still, regardless of the strange and somewhat cartoonish new settings,<br />
the door was ahead of him as before.  It was blue, hollow and<br />
plastic and, above all, not locked.</p>

<p>As the <s>magic</s> <s>science</s><br />
magic fades, Gustaffsen finds himself once more in the dusty old<br />
Northwest tower of Castle Poppy.  Dust scatters from under his<br />
feet - and so do vegetables.  Abandoning their now fruitless quest<br />
to barricade the door they scamper off as fast as they can, sometimes<br />
clambering over dozens of their kin in their effort to flee.</p>
<p>Just as the dust finally settles, bringing a cough to Gustaffsen&#039;s<br />
throat, a strange bleeping sound emanates from the old scientist&#039;s<br />
pocket...</p>

<p>A moment later, the dust is distinctly unsettled again as the now<br />
incandescant Geordie explodes through the door in a bizarre horizontal<br />
shower of splinters, woodchips and fine misty sawdust. The momentum<br />
from the charge hardly reduced, he continues onwards ploughing through<br />
the tiny starch-covered attempt at a barricade and crashing full tilt<br />
into the opposite wall.</p>
<p>With a muttered "Gan canny", the Geordie staggers back, shakes himself<br />
and twists his dazed head around, scenting for the unnatural<br />
vegetables, utterly oblivious of the white haired scientist standing by<br />
him.</p>
<p>Finally, catching the distinct odour of a vegetable in need of boiling<br />
for several hours, he charge off up the stairs after the vegetables.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>The dust settles and the Potatoes scatter about Gustaffsen&#039;s feet the<br />
beeping sound from his pocket ceases and music starts to play.  As<br />
the highly annoying and strangly pitched music drifts over the potatoes<br />
tiny hands are raised to their heads to cover the sound and up at the<br />
top of the tower roosting bats scatter from their nests in fear.</p>
<p>Reaching into his pocket the Fae scientist quicky removes two strangly<br />
metalic vegetative items.  Firstly he places the small cucumber<br />
like device over his ear, where it grip itself in place with a small<br />
set of blueish coloured teeth.  This done he quickly runs his<br />
thumb over a large darkpurple aggragate fruit, carfully depressing<br />
various drupelets which have faintly glowing symbols on them.</p>
<p>In a very composed but still slightly two tone voice he says,<br />
"Hello?  You have reached Gustaffsen how can I be of service to<br />
you today?"</p>
<p>At that moment a resounding crash utters from the door, and then the<br />
opposite wall, as a strangly accented Fae burst into the hallway<br />
sending potatoes and dust everywhere.  As the strange recovers and<br />
tears off up the stairs Gustaffsent mutters "Ein moment please" and<br />
depresses the &#039;hold call&#039; drupelet on the large black berry in his hand.</p>
<p>"This is" &#039;Not good is it.&#039;  He says to himself.  "Too many<br />

with you" &#039;As soon as you can?&#039;  "Exactly."</p>
<p>Then with a sound akin to the tearing of velcro there seemed to be, to<br />
anyone who was actually paying attention, two Gustaffsen&#039;s standing in<br />
the room though both subtly differant.  The next moment the air<br />
stirred and there was the slightest impression of a smartly dressed and<br />
well groomed scientist dashing away up the stiars, popping bits of<br />
bannana into his mouth as he went.</p>
<p>Gusstaffsen once more lifted the berry and started depressing dupelets<br />
as if nothing strange had happened, which obviously not thing had as he<br />
knew exactly what was going on, and spoke into the blue toothed<br />
cucumber.  "Sorry about that, there was a slight altercation with<br />
a Northerner and a wall.  What can I do fo you Mein Freund?"</p>
<p><font color="red">OOC:  Wayfare + Fae for split travel.  And<br />
Wayfare + Fae for speedy travel from the extra energy the bananna is<br />
giving.</font></p>
<p>[<font>Private to GM:<br />
Okies there you go, I think wayfare and Fae works for both the things I<br />
wish to do.  The split is basically him splitting off one of the<br />
parts of his conciousness and sending that off, kinda like astral<br />
projection but not quite, when they decide to the two bits will refore<br />
at eaither location.  I guess he developed it for when he had a<br />
project he needed to get on with but had to still attent functions or<br />
travel places.</font></p>
<p>As for the Bananna thing, well didn&#039;t you know that bananna&#039;s are high<br />
in sugars and great for giving you energy on the move.  Thus<br />
enabling you to move faster and travel great distances... ;)<br />
He&#039;ll keep the bananna skin though, might come in hand.</p>
<p>Now this is where you roll and it all fucks up :D]</p>

<p>With a sound not un-akin to reality fraying around the edges, where<br />
once there was but one scientist, now there were two.  As<br />
Gustafssen stayed behind to answer his PVA (Personal Vegetable<br />
Assistant), the other Gustafssen sprinted upstairs to join the Geordie<br />
as he emerged at the current top of the tower.</p>
<p>The two of them blinked until their eyes adjusted to the abnormal<br />
light.  No usual weather was this; the sky lit itself almost<br />
constantly with lightning flashes that poured into the weather control<br />
device and with the green coruscating fire that flared up and down the<br />
spire.</p>
<p>Time seemed to slow, the air became thicker and lighter.  The<br />
Geordie levelled his crossbow.  Gustafssen slipped and jumped<br />
forward, his arms outstretched.  A potato, larger than the others,<br />
jumped from atop the control console.</p>
<p>The crossbow fired.</p>
<p>Gustafssen grabbed the potato from mid-air.</p>
<p>The potatoes looked upwards in anticipation.</p>
<p>The scientist collided with the controls, landing heavily against the biggest of the levers.</p>
<p>The crossbow bolt ceased its flight.</p>
<p>Time stopped.</p>
<p>The world became electric.</p>
<p>And then the lightning bolt hit.</p>
<p>As if wound on a spring, the tension in the world released.<br />
Gustafssen crashed to the ground, potato in hand.  His special ops<br />
vegetables burst from their hiding places and set about the assembled<br />
tubers.  The crossbow bolt smashed into the core of the giant<br />
device, scattering sparks and cogs.</p>
<p>The lightning bolt reversed itself, arcing up into the sky and<br />
spreading out across the clouds, boiling them away, until the weather<br />
control device had inflicted upon the land...</p>
<p>"Ah," remarked Hugh from the base of the tower.  "Bright with sunny spells.  Good-o!"</p>
