<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane tapped her snout against the glass of the window, leaving a faint<br />
nose-shaped smudge. It was closed, but not latched; careful pressure<br />
pushed it open and she streaked inside to land gently on the floor in<br />
front of Ilandra and Cain. Their clothes seemed a bit the worse for the<br />
wear, but they themselves looked fine, and that was what really<br />
concerned her.</p>
<p>"Before you ask," she said, hoping to forestall Ilandra&#039;s indignation<br />
at the thought of being babysat by her cousin, "I wasn&#039;t following you,<br />
but since I wound up here, I thought I might as well make sure you&#039;re<br />
okay."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>In a surprising move, Ilandra didn&#039;t throw a hissy fit and stamp her feet, but instead shrugged.</p>
<p>"That&#039;s ok, the peasants outside reckon we&#039;re their only hope and so we<br />
can&#039;t leave..." she said, her voice betraying her annoyance.<br />
"Furthermore, the sick people that we&#039;re expected to make better have<br />
infections and I didn&#039;t pay much attention when the Sister was teaching<br />
us about that kind of thing. On top of which it&#039;s not fun anymore.<br />
Though the head peasant seems to think all nobles are evil and wants to<br />
lead a revolt against the horrible oppression at the hands of the evil<br />
nasty nobility." As she finished this sentence she pulled a funny face.<br />
"Not to mention the fact that he&#039;s really scary all of a sudden" the<br />
look on Ilandra&#039;s face was so serious, and she could feel her throat<br />
tighten but she controlled it.<br />
<i> best not show akane that i&#039;m having trouble... </i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane quickly ran the facts through her mind. "I&#039;m here to retrieve the faun&#039;s family. Nyano wanted to indenture him <i>and his family</i><br />
as punishment for Albert&#039;s crime. It wasn&#039;t fair. I said we&#039;d take them<br />
- more than enough of our own lands are lying fallow after we lost so<br />
many. He&#039;s from around here, you see, and they lost everything.</p>
<p>"This is Hyacinth territory. I&#039;m told the war stomped through it,<br />
several times, both sides. The peasants are bound to serve nobles who<br />
don&#039;t care about their wellbeing, their fields are burned, and their<br />
families are hungry. At this point, even if they could believe that not<br />
all the gentry are caught up in their petty feuds, I&#039;m not sure they&#039;d<br />
care," she sighed. "We do have a revolution on our hands, Cousin, and<br />
I&#039;m not sure <i>what</i> we can do about it besides hope they find a way to fill their bellies and decide to let it go."</p>
<p>Then she tried to remember what she knew about infections. "There isn&#039;t<br />
much you can do with what you have available. Clean the wound out well<br />
and put a poultice on it. Willow bark tea. If I can, once I&#039;ve gotten<br />
Albert&#039;s family out of here, I&#039;ll try to head into Mortalia and bring<br />
you back some penicillin, if the Hospital turns out to be short on<br />
antibiotics."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Indentured?" said Ilandra, her expression fliiting between fury and confusion. "We <i>don&#039;t</i> indenture people...especially not on the orders of another house."</p>
<p>She turned to Cain. "I&#039;ll make an exception for your house. This once. But I am capable of running our land!"</p>
<p>Turning back to her cousin she calmed down. "I <i>can</i> do it!<br />
It doesn&#039;t look hard to do, so why would I find it hard? By the<br />
flowers, I&#039;m gone for 5 minutes and my house gets taken over by<br />
Regara..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>The last time Ilandra had been harsh to her, Akane had felt guilty. This time, she just found herself getting angry.</p>
<p>"It was this or death for him, this or slavery for all of them. You<br />
know he&#039;s not going to be treated any differently from the free<br />
peasants if he comes to our lands, and it was not on their <i>orders</i><br />
that I did this, and they wouldn&#039;t hear of it unless I went into<br />
Hyacinth territory to fetch his family myself! I damn near wound up in<br />
fisticuffs with Nyano for this family&#039;s freedom!" Akane said, her<br />
hysterical wail rendered comical by the fact that she was trying to<br />
keep it to a whisper. "I was <i>trying</i> to uphold the principles of<br />
compassion our house is based on, and all you have to say is that our<br />
house has been taken over by Regara, when I&#039;ve been walking on the<br />
knife&#039;s edge to defy her will without incurring her wrath?" she<br />
snarled, vulpine nostrils flairing.</p>
<p>"I have to go before I do lose my temper and can&#039;t keep quiet. I&#039;ll<br />
bring you supplies from the hospital, if you think you&#039;ll still be here<br />
- see, I don&#039;t want to have to sneak through enemy territory <i>twice</i> thinking I&#039;m doing what you&#039;d want only for it to turn out I&#039;ve somehow fucked up again."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra grabbed Akane and picked her up into a hug. Breaking into silent tears she whispered in her cousin&#039;s ear.</p>
<p>"I just wanna get out of here with Cain and it&#039;s kinda frustrating that<br />
they have sick people cos otherwise I could be out of here within two<br />
shakes of a moggie&#039;s tail..." she lifted her head a little "I&#039;m sorry,<br />
I didn&#039;t realise... I&#039;ve been really mean to you haven&#039;t I?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane rubbed her foxy face against Ilandra&#039;s. "You kind of have been<br />
mean, yeah, but...you&#039;ve had a lot of pressure to bear all alone, and<br />
some of what you said, I did deserve, and I probably needed to hear it,<br />
as nothing less would have made me realise.</p>
<p>"As for the sick people, I know you can&#039;t leave them. It&#039;s just not in<br />
your nature. When I first realised you were trying to sneak away you<br />
remember how I thought you was abandoning us? I should&#039;ve known better.<br />
You weren&#039;t, and somehow you&#039;ve managed to find people that need you<br />
just as much here that you equally can&#039;t walk away from.</p>
<p>"Just...I know I don&#039;t need to say this, but be careful. People with<br />
revolution on their mind don&#039;t often care who their scapegoat is. If<br />
something happens, tell them that someone is bringing medicine, which<br />
they will receive only as long as you remain free and unharmed.<br />
Although of course I&#039;d prefer that you just got out of here if it looks<br />
like you need to."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"but what if they decide that they have been slighted..." she started.<br />
"waiiit... if they think i&#039;m their salvation they&#039;ll be extra nice to<br />
us... so they might forgive a lot more... and might let us go<br />
unharmed... we spun them a tale about how we&#039;re trying to save some<br />
baron&#039;s daughter... they seem to have bought it for now."</p>
<p>she shifted into cat form and jumped at her cousin in a kitty glomp.</p>
<p>"you&#039;re a genius! (please stay a little bit)"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"A baron&#039;s daughter? Are you sure they&#039;ll buy it, and are you sure<br />
they&#039;ll care? If it&#039;s a noble, I doubt they&#039;ll be overly sympathetic,"<br />
Akane responded. "(I can stay for a little while)," she added in a<br />
whisper, "(But I&#039;ve got Poppy guards waiting for me to come back with<br />
Albert&#039;s family at the border to the Hyacinth lands, so I don&#039;t know<br />
for how long. Certainly until I locate them, but wouldn&#039;t you want me<br />
to bring back the medicine as fast as possible?)"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"(have you seen the patients? i don&#039;t think they&#039;ll last the week...<br />
and those that recover will take forever...) i&#039;m employing liberal<br />
amounts of feverfew and washing the wounds. But I think I could do with<br />
a second opinion.." Ilandra said.</p>
<p>At this point, Cain said "The story she spun them was about how if we<br />
helped the baron&#039;s daughter we could stay together... I don&#039;t think the<br />
guy bought that... nor my poor excuse for a peasant accent... even<br />
though Ilandra made him believe my aceet was genuine, but I doubt she<br />
can fuddle the whole village."</p>
<p>"So we&#039;re potentially in a tiny spot of bother..." interjected Ilandra,<br />
"I&#039;ll manage to get us out of here, besides, Akane will be passing back<br />
through within a couple of days so if we&#039;re still here <i>she&#039;ll help us out of here</i> won&#039;t you?" the sheer amounts of hopefulness in Ilandra&#039;s eyes belied her confident tone of voice.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Of course," Akane nodded. "If you want out, I&#039;ll get you out. I&#039;m just<br />
going to have to find a way to explain two rather refined peasants, a<br />
family of fauns, and a fox all traipsing towards the border. Isn&#039;t <i>that</i><br />
going to be fun...we&#039;d best travel by night and keep off the roads I<br />
guess. If either of you knows a cantrip for camouflage that you can use<br />
when I come fetch you, that&#039;d also be a help.</p>
<p>"Keep your heads down, alright? While I&#039;m gone, try to think of a way<br />
to get antibiotics to these people safely once we&#039;ve fetched it from<br />
the Hospital, or Mortalia as need be. Cain, try not to speak too much -<br />
I&#039;m willing to bet you couldn&#039;t sound common if your life depended on<br />
it, and it may. Ilandra, keep your lies simple and don&#039;t confuse the<br />
details; look them in the eye while you&#039;re lying, and when you speak, <i>believe</i> what you&#039;re saying.</p>
<p>"If you need to make a run for it and I&#039;m not back yet, this is where<br />
I&#039;m going..." she finished, and recited the directions to Albert&#039;s home.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked incredibly amused. "Are you trying to tell a Pooka how<br />
to lie?" she giggled a little... "mind you, it&#039;s good advice...<br />
seriously though, we&#039;re just trying to get to the council, so we&#039;ll<br />
probably keep going that way. Just that I accidentally got us into a<br />
jam. If we manage to get out of here then we&#039;ll go your way to make<br />
sure you don&#039;t worry too much."</p>
<p>She fidgeted then looking slightly sheepish asked, "Which way is the council anyways?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane nodded. "Yes, please, don&#039;t give me a premature heart attack,<br />
just let me know you&#039;re okay. But...the Council? Whatever do you need<br />
that for?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well... It would probably raise a lot of hackles if a previously Red<br />
sided Prince married a neutral Duchess on the sly... So I figured the<br />
easiest way to get round that is to go and ask the two Rose dukes to do<br />
the ceremony and then all of Faeries&#039; nobles would need to be invited.<br />
Going to the council and asking them to do the hard work just seemed<br />
more proper..." Ilandra replied, in a matter of fact way. "And Cain<br />
said it was a good idea..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Er... I did?" asked Cain, somewhat taken aback.  "I don&#039;t<br />
remember, er, I mean...  That&#039;d cause a lot of problems.<br />
Trying to get the two Rose dukes to do something together, I<br />
mean.  I&#039;m not sure it&#039;d really happen, to be honest.  Still,<br />
it looks like that&#039;s the way things are going.  Um."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Immediately, Nyano&#039;s plan about using Cain and Ilandra&#039;s wedding as<br />
bait to draw out the party responsible for the attempted &#039;poisoning&#039; of<br />
the Poppies and their guests jumped to Akane&#039;s mind.</p>
<p>"It would also be very dangerous," she said carefully. You saw what<br />
happened at the homecoming feast; it was a perfect opportunity to<br />
target many important nobles at once. And whilst our House is small,<br />
Ilandra, the fact that we have the Hospital, coupled with the<br />
controversy of your marrying a Prince of a Red-aligned House, means<br />
that your wedding will be a reasonably high-profile event.</p>
<p>"Whoever was behind Albert&#039;s mock-poisoning attempt could choose then<br />
to strike again. In fact, Nyano actually suggested a plan to that<br />
effect - I wasn&#039;t too happy with it or him, given it seems to require<br />
using his Prince, who is also my friend, and my Duchess, who is also my<br />
only family, as an expendable strategic asset. Whatever you do, Cousin,<br />
be careful, and don&#039;t take anything at face value. I know I&#039;m really<br />
used to seeing everything as a conspiracy, but this really feels like<br />
one."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"In getting both the Dukes to preside we&#039;d be cementing our neutrality,<br />
though if they refuse at least they&#039;ve been invited. Also, if I am not<br />
too mistaken, our house still has the gooby thing on it that makes<br />
violence pretty damned hard to do." Ilandra said, matter of factly,<br />
"Also, I refuse to be bait for any trap and using Cain as bait is just<br />
evil... Besides, I think he&#039;s well aware that he has to give up his<br />
political leanings and accept that he is going to be neutral. In fact,<br />
I figured it&#039;d be an important part of the whole thing really, hence<br />
why we need both sides to witness it. If there is another poisoning,<br />
well the hospital&#039;s right next door and I&#039;m sure I can persuade one of<br />
the farmers to taste the food before it goes out to the people. After<br />
all, it&#039;s not like Milligan dislikes food... Does that satisfy you?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane grinned. "Yes, I&#039;m sure Milligan would be happy to help - it&#039;s<br />
not like we can ask Regara for her assistance. "If you&#039;re really set on<br />
going through with this plan, though, wouldn&#039;t it be better if you got<br />
someone to escort you? I&#039;m guessing you need me to go back to our lands<br />
and act as administrator during your absence, but this isn&#039;t good<br />
territory to be traveling through, judging by the people we&#039;ve run into<br />
so far."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, seeing as we&#039;re not exactly prisoners as such... I don&#039;t think<br />
we&#039;re bound to stay for longer than necessary" Ilandra said. "Besides,<br />
Cain&#039;s strong and brave... he fended off a troop of bandits on his own<br />
before so he&#039;ll be able to protect us. Surely this would make him the<br />
best possible escort, right? Besides, it&#039;s not like I don&#039;t know how to<br />
handle myself if I&#039;m involved in a fight..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane nodded. "I&#039;m probably worrying too much - a lifetime&#039;s worth of<br />
hiding you from an enraged Regara I guess. I think the sooner I go and<br />
fetch Albert&#039;s family, the sooner I can help spring you two out of here<br />
if you want, or bring back medicine, whichever. Besides, if they hear <i>three</i> voices, and noble ones at that, and come investigating, we&#039;re bound to be in quite a lot of trouble."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Almost as if on cue, the door to the back room burst open and smacked<br />
into the wall beside it.  Into the room half-staggered and<br />
half-fell Jebodiah&#039;s son.</p>
<p>"There won&#039;t be anyone in here," his gruff voice announced, "so we..."</p>
<p>He looked up, and noticed that the room already had occupants.  His breath began to wrinkle the paint on the walls.</p>
<p>"Oh.  Nevermind," he mumbled, and turned around only to fall backwards onto the floor.</p>
<p>A young lady some twenty years his junior, presumably the target of his<br />
intended affection, peered around the door frame.  She glanced<br />
briefly down at Jake&#039;s unconscious body, then back up to Ilandra and<br />
Cain whom she flashed a sheepish grin.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Erm..." Ilandra managed, then out of sheer surprise kittened up.<br />
"Balls!" she exclaimed from the floor. She ran up Cain&#039;s trouser leg<br />
and hid in the pocket, hoping Akane wouldn&#039;t get noticed.</p>
<p><i>the peasants we lived with knew better than to hurt foxes... but<br />
these ones might hurt her for the hell of it... god! why did i have to<br />
fuzz up like this? how embarrassing!</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"B... balls?" the young woman asked to no-one in particular, before her eyes managed to focus on Cain.</p>
<p>"Did that girl just...  She...  A cat..." the woman<br />
spluttered, seeming to to have lost control of her speech just as she&#039;d<br />
regained control of her eyesight.  "I&#039;ve gotta&#039; drink less.<br />
Or more.  Maybe both."</p>
<p>With that she spun a neat 180 degrees on the spot, took one step<br />
forward, crashed into the door and lurched unsteadily from the room.q</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Sure that the girl had gone, Ilandra jumped out of Cain&#039;s pocket and<br />
morphed back to her normal shape. "Well, I reckon we&#039;d best be getting<br />
back to the party... see you soon Akane." she said, grabbing Cain&#039;s<br />
hand and dragging him back into the hubbub.</p>
<p>As they exited the room, she made sure she looked just dishevelled<br />
enough not to arouse suspicion then rushed up to the bar and asked<br />
politely for another flagon of ale each. (making sure she kept her<br />
accent up)</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Ale?  Right y&#039;are," said the temporary barmaid.  "Though I<br />
wouldn&#039;a though af&#039;er jus&#039; now ye&#039;d be back fer a second!  Goin&#039; a<br />
bit ta yer &#039;ead, eh?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, have yeh got summat nicer than ale?" she inquired. After all, she was kinda thirsty...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"We&#039;s got scrumpy out back," she said.  "Moight be more ta&#039; yer<br />
taste.  An&#039; if ya&#039; fancy summat stronger, there&#039;s always th&#039;<br />
moonshoine..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra pondered for a moment. <i>moonshine sounds so sophisticated and grown up... whereas scrumpy sounds odd...</i></p>
<p>"Could I try both?" she asked.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Aha!" exxclaimed the barmaid.  "I knew it!  Still, &#039;tis the toime for celebratin&#039;, Oi guess!"</p>
<p>She turned and headed into the back rooms of the inn.  Almost as<br />
soon as she had left the bar, an elderly man sidled up to it and<br />
glanced furtively back and forth.  After sufficiently convincing<br />
himself that no-one was looking, he grabbed an empty flagon and reached<br />
it over the bar toward the open barrel.</p>
<p>"Jethro!" came the barmaid&#039;s rasied voice from the back.  "Don&#039;t<br />
you be sneakin&#039; a sly one!  Y&#039;know your wife&#039;d &#039;ave me guts fer<br />
garters if I din&#039; stop ye."</p>
<p>The old man looked startled at first, then sheepish, then he sidled off and was lost in the partying crowd.</p>
<p>Before long the barmaid emerged again, a ceramic mug in one hand and a<br />
tiny metal thimble clasped between thumb and forefinger of the<br />
other.  She set them both down before Ilandra, and smiled.</p>
<p>"Now&#039;n," she said, "take yer pick!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"erm... ok..." she said, uncertainly, reaching for the thimble. She<br />
picked it up and gave a perfunctory sniff before daintily sipping from<br />
it. Eyes streaming, she put the thimble down.</p>
<p>"*cough* &#039;s a bit... *cough* potent..." she managed then picked up the<br />
scrumpy. This she sniffed and put down. "can&#039;t smell anything... wow,<br />
that last stuff was strong" she gingerly took a sip from the ceramic<br />
glass. "Did something die in this? It tastes kinda like mouse... I like<br />
it."</p>
<p>She handed the thimble to Cain. "Don&#039;t inhale" and settled in her chair to daintily sip at the scrumpy.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The barmaid raised an eyebrow at Ilandra&#039;s announcement that she liked<br />
drinks that tasted of mice, and turned to smile a knowing grimace at<br />
Cain, who was looking uncertainly at the thimbleful of clear liquid.</p>
<p>Slowly, Cain raised the cup to his face, blinking his eyes rapidly to<br />
dispel the tears that the mere whiff of the moonshine was<br />
eliciting.  He gulped once, twice...  And the third time he<br />
gulped, the alcohol disappeared down his throat with it.</p>
<p>"You know, that wasn&#039;t so-"</p>
<p>And he stopped, his eyes wide, gazing into nothing.  Seconds<br />
passed, and he appeared completely incapable of moving.  He hadn&#039;t<br />
even blinked.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked up at an immobile Cain.</p>
<p><i>is he playing a joke on me?</i></p>
<p>She then gingerly poked him. He rocked back and forth. Panic was<br />
beginning to set in. Attempting to keep her composure, Ilandra asked<br />
the barmaid "There&#039;s nothing actually harmful in that, right?"</p>
<p>The barmaid winked "Who knows?"</p>
<p>Ilandra poked Cain again and again he rocked back and forth. She<br />
rummaged in her bag and pulled out some smelling salts, they had no<br />
effect. Panic started to take its hold fully causing her to drop the<br />
accent she&#039;d been using until then.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, he&#039;s dead!" she said, shaking him. "Don&#039;t be dead, damnit!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The barmaid sighed, and patted Ilandra on the head.</p>
<p>"&#039;E ain&#039;t dead, love," she said.  "Ye jus&#039;... might wanna be<br />
&#039;prared fer foive minutes toime, when &#039;all catches up wi&#039;m."  With<br />
that she smiled a wide, toothy grin, and turned to serve a tall man who<br />
was looming over at the other end of the bar.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Reassured slightly Ilandra calmed visibly and picked her "mouse juice" back up.</p>
<p>"What&#039;ll happen in five minutes time, I wonder..." she murmured to herself and sat back to wait for the five minutes to pass.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Five minutes passed, as minutes are wont to do, with the inhabitants of<br />
the inn making merry in the traditional manner.  Barely a soul in<br />
the place paid attention to Ilandra and Cain, who still stared into<br />
space as if it were the most fascinating thing in the world.  Only<br />
the frequent glances reminded Ilandra that time was, in fact, passing.</p>
<p>Then, as if some cosmic alarm clock regulated the world, Cain virtually exploded into life.</p>
<p>"BytheDagdaandDanu!" he exclaimed at at least double-time.<br />
"Whatthehelldoyoumakethisstuffoutof?  WaitwhatinFaerie?<br />
Whyiseverythingmovingsoslowly?  Ilandra?  Ilandra?<br />
Whoaitsallinslowmotion!  Iwonderifthisispermanent?<br />
Idon&#039;tthinkI...  Oooooooohhhhh."  And... normal speed again.</p>
<p>"Ooh.  I... Ilandra?" he asked, spinning slowly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Looking furtively around and hoping no-one noticed the outburst,<br />
Ilandra made hush motions at him. Then, noticing people looking,<br />
giggled and told him "No, silly, Ilandra&#039;s not here, remember... we<br />
were on a mission... remember?" He looked kinda confused.</p>
<p>"Everyone&#039;s looking, you&#039;re gonna get us killed" she hissed then in<br />
normal volume. "Poor love... he gets so confused sometimes..." <i> oh holy crud</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Around Ilandra and Cain, laughter erupted from the already mostly<br />
inebriated population of the inn.  Various fragmented phrases such<br />
as "been at the moonshine" and "make a man of &#039;im yet" floated above<br />
the general background racket and, across from them in one corner of<br />
the bar, was that a pair of golden eyes watching and chuckling in<br />
amusement...?</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Turning a colour that is really only appropriate for tomatoes, Ilandra focused on her mouse juice.</p>
<p>"y&#039;know... that was kinda mean... but there&#039;s nothing i can do..." she<br />
murmured. She looked up and noticed the golden eyes. Taking another sip<br />
from the mouse juice, she resolved to work out why those eyes were so<br />
shiny...</p>
<p>When she was sure that most of the room weren&#039;t paying attention or<br />
were too drunk to care, she carefully melted into her cat form and<br />
snuck across the room, where she morphed back behind a chair and walked<br />
the rest of the way up to Jebodiah, making sure she approached from<br />
behind.</p>
<p>"So, what&#039;s the deal with them eyes?" she asked him, suddenly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Ah," said Jebodiah, turning to face Ilandra and not looking in the<br />
least surprised by her appearing from behind him.  His eyes locked<br />
with hers, blazing gold as ever they had.  Then, after a few<br />
seconds, he blinked and dropped his gaze to the floor.</p>
<p>He sighed.  "I were wonderin&#039; &#039;ow long it&#039;d take you t&#039;ask.<br />
E&#039;ryone does sooner&#039;a later."  Another sigh, and a long gulp of<br />
his ale.  "There be a story be&#039;ind that&#039;n an&#039; no mistake.<br />
Bu&#039;..."  He gazed into his pint, the light from his eyes<br />
reflecting slightly off the foam.</p>
<p>"Bu&#039; that&#039;s a story fer &#039;nother toime.  Fer naa, let&#039;s jus&#039; say<br />
tha&#039; I were bless&#039;d, or mebbe cursed, ta see more than I oughta&#039;."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>She gulped, "How much more?" she asked, wondering whether they&#039;d been rumbled already, then deciding they probably had.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"More than any man oughta&#039;," he said.  "Truth be tol&#039; I wouldn&#039; be<br />
in t&#039; position Oi am t&#039;day w&#039;out it.  But gi&#039;n choice<br />
back&#039;n...  I dunno if Oi&#039;d want it."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Cheer up, it could be worse..." she said. "Would you like some mouse juice? they call it scrunchy or summat..."</p>
<p>before he had a chance to answer she was gone, again in cat form<br />
towards the bar. Within a few minutes she returned, with two mugs of<br />
scrumpy and Cain in tow.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Scrunchy?" asked Jebodiah once the girl had returned.  "Mouse<br />
juice?  Now you mus&#039; be from a lon&#039; way aways, or from some very<br />
strange place &#039;ndeed!  Have ye not heard a&#039; Scrumpy &#039;afore?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra blushed. "Erm... sorta not, I always got given cocoa before cos<br />
I was too young." she said, looking fixedly at the floor. Handing over<br />
the mug, she sat down on the floor by Cain&#039;s feet and commenced her<br />
attack on the mug of scrumpy.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Ah, Oi see," said Jebodiah.  He thought for a moment, then<br />
started to look worried.  "If ye ain&#039;t &#039;ad it afore, Oi&#039;d,<br />
ah...  B&#039;careful &#039;ow quick ya&#039; knock th&#039; stuff back."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra thought about it for a second, failed to string more than a<br />
thought up and decided to thank Jebodiah for his advice. Then<br />
discovered she&#039;d lost automotive functions and had quite heavy eyelids.</p>
<p>Snuggling into Cain&#039;s leg, she fell asleep.</p>
