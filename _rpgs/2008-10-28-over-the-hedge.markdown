<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>So, it seemed that Abel wasn&#039;t kidding about his fondness for delayed<br />
breakfasting.  The sun had already risen halfway through the sky<br />
on a warm April morning, Saledenre had long since fed and prepared<br />
everything she would need for the journey to the human world.  But<br />
the Poppy prince hadn&#039;t yet made an appearance, and the best time for<br />
crossing the Hedge was fast approaching.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Gah, Mortalia&#039;s turning me into a Grump," the Eshu muttered under her<br />
breath, knowing full well that before she left Arcadia in search of new<br />
and interesting tales she would never have worried so much about<br />
time.  Still, she found her feet leading her around the maze of<br />
corridors that made up House Poppy in search of the absent prince.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel was not hard to find - or at least, something that was probably<br />
Abel.  As Saledenre walked down the corridor toward his room,<br />
rustlings and clangings and cursings were quite obviously coming from<br />
behind his door.  It sounded for all the world like someone within<br />
was taking the place apart in search of something-or-other.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Saledenre sighed and reached into the voluminous folds of her traveling<br />
clothes.  The hardy, yet beautiful, fabric rustled from the<br />
movement as the Eshu searched for her move prized possession.  The<br />
little silver compass that she cupped in the palm of her hand was<br />
intricately engraved but this was not what made it so special.  In<br />
a much practised movement, Saledenre flipped open the little lid to<br />
reveal a little silver arrow that span round and round, ever so fast<br />
until it stopped suddenly.  A smile, full of mischief, planted<br />
itself on the traveller&#039;s lips as she wondered what Abel would say if<br />
she were to suddenly appear in his room without warning.</p>
<p>But then he might get frightened and make more of a mess and so take<br />
longer, she reasoned and stowed the compass away.  No, she would<br />
have to do things by more conventional means.  In two quick<br />
strides, Saledenre was at the door and hammering loudly upon its wooden<br />
surface.</p>
<p>"Abel!  We&#039;re supposed to be traveling, not remodelling!" she yelled.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Sorry!" shouted Abel from some muffled depth of the room.  A few<br />
seconds and almost as many rustles and crashes later, he made it to the<br />
door and opened it a foot or so.  Inside, Saledenre could glimpse<br />
the principle of raw chaos itself as applied to bookshelves.  Abel<br />
himself had dragged behind him a large backpack that was already full<br />
to bursting point with books and scrolls.</p>
<p>"Sorry," he repeated, seeming somewhat out of breath.  "Packing&#039;s<br />
taking a while.  I&#039;ve been trying to dig up everything I have on<br />
the humans&#039; technology; it might help while I&#039;m there."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Saledenre tilted her head sharply to the right, a smile of bemusement making her lips twitch at the corners.  <i>He definately has not heard of a palm pilot</i> she thought to herself.  The words she spoke, however, had a little more diplomacy about them.</p>
<p>"How long has it been since you properly ventured into Mortalia?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, ah, what with the war and having to flee and such, it&#039;s<br />
been...  I don&#039;t know...  Two and a half years?  I never<br />
did manage to calculate exactly how fast time is in the human world by<br />
comparison.  Last time I was there, they were all excited about a<br />
new thing called a...  Tel?  Telly?</p>
<p>"...Telly-phone!  That was it."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p><i>Oh no!</i>  Saledenre fought to urge to wipe her hand over her face.</p>
<p>"Ok, princey, hand over the bag."  The storyteller held out her<br />
hand for the carrier which was almost bursting at the seams.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel raised an eyebrow at "Princey", but after a few moments held the bag out to Saledenre anyway.</p>
<p>"This would be one of those &#039;I&#039;ve just said something incredibly stupid&#039; moments, wouldn&#039;t it?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Telephones have been around for... a while," Saledenre told him,<br />
pulling books out of his bag, reading the titles and then (more often<br />
than not) throwing the books back into Abel&#039;s rooms at high<br />
velocity.  She seemed completely nonplussed by the fact that some<br />
of the books had very near misses with the prince&#039;s head while he<br />
dodged out of the way.</p>
<p>"There," she said rather happy with herself, "that&#039;s better."  The<br />
bag was handed back, containing a couple of the more recent books and a<br />
map of the London Underground carefully contained within.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel looked somewhat disappointed that a good three-quarters of his amassed knowledge had been spurned as out-of-date.</p>
<p>"I always forget," he said, "how fast things change for the<br />
humans.  It&#039;s quite annoying, I must say.  Still, I suppose<br />
I&#039;d better have another attempt at understanding their world this time<br />
around."</p>
<p>He followed Saledenre out of his room, and closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>"Right then, lead on!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Leading Abel to the stables at something of a half skip, Saledenre<br />
listened out for the sound of her steed and was able to pin point his<br />
presense within a moment.</p>
<p>"Hello you," she said over the top of the stall door, looking at the<br />
fairy cat who looked up from the oversized ball of yarn he was playing<br />
with.  The sound of Hefin&#039;s purring reverberated through<br />
Saledenre&#039;s body and she could not help but grin.  "Ready for<br />
another journey?"</p>
<p>The great fairy cat unfurled his wings a little, the motion<br />
demonstrating his restlessness.  It seemed that being stabled<br />
ill-suited the animal and Saledenre sympathises.</p>
<p>"Do you have a steed, Prince Abel?" Saledenre asked as she opened the<br />
stable door, allowing Hefin to walk out.  She stroked the great<br />
cat&#039;s forehead as she looked at the Poppy prince, waiting for his<br />
answer.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Of course," said Abel, disappearing for a few minutes around a corner<br />
and into another stable.  He returned leading a sleepy-looking<br />
grey horse on whose saddle and harness every silver button and buckle<br />
bore the faint traced outline of a poppy.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m afraid he&#039;s not quite as, er, exotic as yours..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Erm..." Saledenre looked a bit concerned.  "What are you going to do with it once we head through to the Other Side?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well," said Abel, "If we&#039;re taking them through, I&#039;ll find a stable<br />
for him I suppose.  Shouldn&#039;t be too hard.  What about <i>yours</i>?  Unless flying cats are commonplace there now?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Saledenre snorted and shook her head as she paused in saddling the giant cat.</p>
<p>"Humans rarely see things that are too out of their perception of<br />
ordinary.  Besides, Hefin&#039;s a fairy cat and has more than enough<br />
tricks up his sleeve to go unnoticed.  Well... most of the time."</p>
<p>The traveller frowned, remembering the newspaper articles of the Beast<br />
of Bodmin; Hefin had been a little less careful that time round when<br />
he&#039;d needed to shake off the domestic cat visage and stretch his legs.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, if having a horse is going to be problematic, there&#039;s no reason<br />
why I can&#039;t leave him on this side.  He can find his own way back,<br />
after all."</p>
<p>Abel stepped up on a stirrup and launched himself into his horse&#039;s saddle.</p>
<p>"Shall we go?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Saledenre&#039;s smile was unsettlingly toothy, like her feline steed&#039;s at<br />
the thought of a journey ahead of them.  "Are you certain you can<br />
keep up?" she teased,</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel smiled a knowing smile.</p>
<p>"I take it, then, you&#039;ve not ridden one of these horses before?  My lady, we&#039;ll have to see if <i>you</i> can keep up!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Nonchalantly, Saledenre settled herself into the saddle and smiled<br />
calmly at Abel.  The expression completely hid the thoughts that<br />
were turning in her mind.</p>
<p><i>Oh, a challenge.  Right, princey-boy, just watch while I leave you in the dust</i>.</p>
<p>There was no outward sign of command from Saledenre to Hefin and get<br />
the great cat leapt forward, bounding out of the stable before Abel had<br />
time to react.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel smiled as Saledenre sped off into the distance.</p>
<p>"So it&#039;s going to be like that, eh?" he said to no-one in<br />
particular.  Starfire nodded, as if he knew exactly what was going<br />
on.  He turned toward the path Saledenre and Hefin had roughly<br />
followed, and trotted, and cantered, and galloped, and... blurred.</p>
<p>Over the Eshu&#039;s shoulder, Abel was far behind - but slowly but surely, catching up...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"What do you say to that, Hefin?" Saledenre cried above the wind that<br />
was whipping against her face.  "Are we going to be out manoeuvred<br />
by a librarian on his pony?"  She felt rather than heard the growl<br />
emanating from the fairy cat&#039;s chest and laughed in reply.  This<br />
was so much fun!</p>
<p>Behind her, Hefin&#039;s wings unfurled and in one bound he was airborne and<br />
gaining altitude with every sweep of his wings.  They would not<br />
continue to fly for too long; though Hefin&#039;s wings were in no was<br />
stumpy like those of the smaller fairy cat breeds, the did not have the<br />
span of the dragons to the north and he would begin to tire within half<br />
an hour.  It would not do to stretch him beyond that point; she<br />
would only ever ask that of her steed when the situation was perilous<br />
indeed.</p>
<p>"Right, now let&#039;s see if we can see the Thinness from up here."<br />
Her fingers were tingling, a sure sign that they were close.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel looked up as Hefin took to the skies, quite unable to pursue on his very much earthbound horse.</p>
<p>"Fine!" he shouted up to Saledenre.  "You win this time, but you&#039;ve gotta&#039; come down sooner or later!"</p>
<p>Away to the south, the small town that surrounded Castle Poppy gave way<br />
at first to fields, then to a wood, and further beyond that to a wide<br />
expanse of meadow.  The latter almost glittered in the late<br />
morning sunlight, shining with an intensity that either made it look so<br />
much more real, or so much less, depending on one&#039;s point of view...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Down there, Hefin.  You see it?"</p>
<p>The great cat growled and changed his course to head towards the<br />
shimmering field.      Saledenre turned in her saddle<br />
and called down the the fairy prince below.</p>
<p>"You&#039;re going to have to play follow-the-leader if you want to get<br />
where we&#039;re going."  And then they were away, Hefin putting on a<br />
burst of speed as they passed over the town and the slowing as they<br />
reached the field next to the Thinness.  Hefin bounded over the<br />
hedge and then they were surrounded by the shimmering, waiting for Abel<br />
to catch up.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel arrived not far behind, but a few minutes that sealed Saledenre&#039;s<br />
victory and his embarrassment.  He looked sufficiently sheepish as<br />
he dismounted at the edge of the field and led his horse across the<br />
patch of faintly shimmering air where Saledenre stood.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Right then," Saledenre pulled out what looked like a cross between a<br />
compass and a pocket watch from one of the hidden pockets that were<br />
liberally placed among to folds of her clothing.  She scruitinised<br />
it a bit, snorted and the stowed it away once more.  "Are you<br />
ready, your highness?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I suppose as ready as I will ever be," replied Abel.  "If things<br />
really have changed as much as you say, then I&#039;m probably excited and<br />
afraid in about equal parts."</p>
<p>He grinned.  Maybe not <i>that</i> afraid...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"We shall see," Saledenre replied with an equally wide grin.  She<br />
dismounted from Hefin and took to prodding the air around her.  It<br />
reacted to her touch, coalescing  at her fingertips in a myriad of<br />
colour reminiscent of washing up liquid on oil.</p>
<p>Beside her, Hefin prowled, growing smaller and smaller with every step<br />
until he was no bigger than a house cat.  He laid his wings<br />
against his back, creating two white  patches of fur from his<br />
shoulder blades to his haunches.</p>
<p>Saledenre knelt down so that feline could jump onto her shoulder,<br />
looped the string of her bad on the other one, and the stood again,<br />
turning to Abel.</p>
<p>"You might want to take hold of my hand for this bit."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Right then," said Abel.  He patted his horse on the neck.  "Back to the castle with you.  I&#039;ll be back soon!"</p>
<p>As Starfire turned and trotted back in the direction of Castle Poppy,<br />
Abel slung his bag over his shoulder, walked over to where Saledenre<br />
stood, and took her proffered hand.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Saledenre kneaded the air with her free hand for a few moments more and<br />
then, as though pushing through a semi-solid object, the Eshu forced<br />
her arm through the Veil.  Saledenre had always likened the<br />
sensation of passing from Arcadia to Mortalia by this method like<br />
walking through warm syrup; there was some resistance which slowed<br />
movement but other than that the sensation was warm and somewhat<br />
comforting.</p>
<p>Her grip tightened as she felt Abel waver slightly as the unusual<br />
sensation hit him.  If she lost him now, he might never be able to<br />
find his way back.  This was her gift, her ability to know exactly<br />
which paths through the Veil to take to get where she wanted to go.</p>
<p>Pausing for a moment, regarding two paths that she could sense rather<br />
than see, Saledenre decided upon the left one.  They walked on for<br />
what seemed to be an eternity, but which was not, until another<br />
shimmering surface began to form in the distance.  As they walked<br />
towards it, Saledenre did not turn back to see how Abel was faring; she<br />
needed to concentrate solely on their destination.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The unreal world-between-worlds of the Hedge faded away around them,<br />
leaving Saledenre and Abel standing in a field not altogether unlike<br />
the one they had left.  The grass was shorter, though, and there<br />
were more people.  Lots more.</p>
<p>No hedgerow marked the boundaries here, though - a cast-iron fence<br />
stood out to the faeries like a blinding aberration in the fabric of<br />
reality.  Beyond it was a blur, obscured by the iron, but<br />
something-or-other - giant structures, perhaps - loomed above.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, sound finally filtered through to their<br />
ears.  An almost deafening roar surrounded them, mechanical noises<br />
and human noises and animal noises, combining together into an<br />
incomprehensible mess.</p>
<p>And finally, the smell.  There was no freshness of Fairyland&#039;s<br />
meadows here, no twinge of pollen and no brisk wind.  The air was<br />
stagnant, thick... recycled.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Hyde Park.  Please remember to<br />
keep you wits about you at all times and eyes peeled for light-fingered<br />
individuals who make a pooka look mannerful and well-behaved."<br />
Saledenre turned, took in a deep lungful of air and proceeded to stick<br />
her tongue out and wrinkle her nose in disgust.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s not until you&#039;ve been to Arcadia and back that you realise just<br />
how rancid the air in this city really is," she told Abel before<br />
tilting her head to one side.   "Come on, this way."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel made to follow her, inadvisably copying her deep breath.<br />
After a second&#039;s pause he coughed and spluttered and doubled over,<br />
drawing as much attention as one can in London - brief glances from<br />
passers-by before they nervously went back to their own business.</p>
<p>"Bad," he coughed, "idea.  How can you breathe this stuff?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Saledenre rolled her eyes, then hooked her hands under Abel&#039;s armpits<br />
before hauling him to his feet.  Somehow, despite the fact the<br />
Arcadian prince was still wheezing and coughing, the Eshu managed to<br />
support him until they reached the relative privacy afforded by the<br />
drooping branches of a willow tree.  Settling him down so his back<br />
rested against the trunk of the tree, Saledenre pulled out a plastic<br />
bottle filled with water from the Poppy estate&#039;s rivers and handed it<br />
to her companion.</p>
<p>"This?  This is nothing.  Why, a hundred Mortalian years ago<br />
the fog produced by coal fires in this city was so thick it could<br />
kill!  Now, you just sit there for a bit and see if you can get<br />
used to this.  It&#039;ll only get worse once we head out of the park<br />
and I can&#039;t carry you all the way round London!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Right," said Abel, getting the hang of drinking the bottle after a brief moment of confusion.</p>
<p>"I suppose, then, that Serin must have ended up not far from<br />
here.  But in all this noise, all this... stuff.  How&#039;re we<br />
even going to begin looking for her?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Hmmm," Saledenre pressed her right index finger against her lips as<br />
she considered where to begin.  "I remember hearing that Serin<br />
once brought a gypsy caravan into Arcadia.  It caused quite a stir<br />
even if Ataxia managed to get the scoop first," the last was said<br />
through gritted teeth.  Saledenre had always considered Ataxia to<br />
be a lesser storyteller, and the fact that the rival bard had been much<br />
in favour for a substandard tail rankled slightly.</p>
<p>"It would make sense that she would be passing herself off as one of<br />
those... uhm... fortune tellers.  You know, there are entire<br />
&#039;Psychic Fairs&#039; now.  Perhaps she might be using her gifts at one<br />
of those.  And the best thing is," Saledenre grinned, "we can ask<br />
Sir Vir if there are any nearby.  Well, that is to say we&#039;ll have<br />
to give the request to his jester Google who will then ask Sir Vir."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel cast his eyes about the place, taking in the panorama of<br />
multi-storey buildings that rose beyond the iron fences of Hyde Park.</p>
<p>"But where would we find him?  This place looks like it&#039;s nothing but palaces!  Do you know which one is Sir Vir&#039;s?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>The sharp look and raised eyebrow that Saledenre directed at the prince<br />
all but spoke the words &#039;don&#039;t be silly&#039;.  "The great unwashed<br />
public of London, nay the _WORLD_ petition Sir Ver for his knowledge<br />
and wisdom.  Do you think he would invite them all into his<br />
palace?  Would you mother, the great Dutchess Regara, allow her<br />
serfs to enter the palace of House Poppy?!?"</p>
<p>Without waiting for Abel to answer what was a blatantly silly question,<br />
Saledenre continued, "We must use the device known as a computer, which<br />
I mentioned at dinner yesterday evening."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Right.  Yes, of course," he said, following Saledenre as they<br />
left Hyde Park and ventured out into the bustle of Oxford Street on a<br />
hot summer day.</p>
<p>Abel almost immediately got separated from Saledenre, and several times<br />
she had to retrace her steps to find the man spacing out or standing<br />
out of the way of the incessant rush of people-traffic.<br />
Thankfully, though, he was easy to spot - his seven feet of faerie<br />
height had diminished somewhat, but six foot six was still above the<br />
majority of the crowd.</p>
<p><font color="red">NOTE TO GM.  HIS NAME IS ABEL, GODSDAMNIT.  STOP WRITING "CAIN".</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Growing weary of constantly losing her companion, Saledenre wove<br />
between the crowds to catch up with Abel.  With no warning, she<br />
grabbed his arm and wrapped it around her shoulder, holding on when<br />
Abel started.</p>
<p>The storyteller met the eyes of a woman headed in the opposite<br />
direction.  She strangers expression was one of sympathy and<br />
understanding.</p>
<p><i>You have one that likes to get lost too, huh?</i>  Saledenre nodded, a grin splashing across her lips, before she began to lead Abel to one side of the crowd.</p>
<p>"Stop fidgeting.  This way you won&#039;t get lost.  Just play<br />
along," she told Abel, while her eyes searched the side of the street<br />
for an internet cafÈ.  <i>Nothing down this one</i>,<br />
she thought before leading Abel onwards.  The next street they had<br />
more luck.  "Ah, there we go."  Her pace increased as she<br />
ushered the fairy prince towards the small, tacky-looking internet cafÈ.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel seemed to get stuck just inside the door, looking back and forth<br />
at the myriad of shining screens and blinking LEDs while Saledenre went<br />
up to the counter to pay.</p>
<p>"Are these... e-lec-tric lamps?" Abel asked as the Eshu guided him over to one of the terminals.  "What <i>is</i> this place?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"It&#039;s an internet cafÈ," she replied as she reached into her pocket and<br />
pulled out a five pound note before giving it to the man behind the<br />
cash desk.  Before Abel could ask any more questions, Saledenre<br />
grabbed hold of his hand and whisked him towards a spare computer in<br />
the corner of the room.  Putting a hand on either of his<br />
shoulders, she pushed the prince into the empty chair with enough force<br />
as though to say <i>Stay</i> before she turned away to find a chair she could pull up next to him.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Saledenre borrowed a chair from in front of an unused computer with<br />
minimal difficulty, sat down at her own terminal, and logged in.<br />
Each click and keypress clearly mystified Abel, each prompting a<br />
question that stuck half-formed in his throat as it was replaced by<br />
another.  By the time Saledenre reached her search results, he&#039;d<br />
given up entirely and just stared mystified at the screen.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"I think the term you&#039;re looking for is &#039;shiny&#039;," Saledenre remarked,<br />
her grin awash with mischief and a dash of kindly mockery.  The<br />
pooka would have understood her amusement, she thought to herself,<br />
turning back to the stark, almost blinding synthetic glare of the<br />
computer screen while her fingers flew over slightly stick keys.</p>
<p>"Now, I think searching for psychic faires on in London at the moment might be the best place to start."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>With little effort that nevertheless confused the hell out of Abel,<br />
Saledenre produced a comprehensive list of all the year&#039;s psychic,<br />
paranormal and otherwise New Agey events in and around London.<br />
Clearly a popular trade in the City, there was something almost every<br />
weekend and this one was no exception.</p>
<p>A quick check of the computer&#039;s clock revealed it to be Saturday 16th<br />
June, on which day there was supposed to be a "Festival of New Age<br />
Crafts" by Camden Lock.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Hopefully she&#039;s like a wasp to honey," Saledenre remarked, reaching<br />
inside her voluminous robes and withdrawing a pen and paper.  She<br />
jotted down the exact location and the the pen and paper disappeared<br />
once again into silken folds.</p>
<p>"Looks like we&#039;re going to Camden, you&#039;ll like it there, it&#039;s quirky,"<br />
Saledenre continued, a bemused corner of her mind noting that her<br />
entire being had already sped up as though it were on a sugar<br />
rush.  <i>That&#039;s what London does to you, I guess</i>.</p>
<p>"Is there anything else you&#039;d like to ask before we tackle the Tube?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Yeah, I... um." Abel stuttered, still not having quite come to his<br />
senses.  He shook his head back and forth.  "Okay, never<br />
mind.  Just one question.  What&#039;s the &#039;tube&#039;?"</p>
