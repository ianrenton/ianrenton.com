<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked around the main hall, to see if she could find Cain. He<br />
wasn&#039;t there. She went out in to the corridor, he wasn&#039;t there either.<br />
She walked back into the room, picked up an untouched bottle of irish<br />
cream and went off in search of her fiancee...</p>
<p>She eventually found him in his room, staring at the ceiling. She<br />
walked over and kissed him, wondering if married life would be the<br />
same. Then putting the irish cream down, morphed into a cat and took<br />
position on his chest.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain, deep in thought, idly scratched Ilandra behind the ears.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>After a minute or so of contented purring, Ilandra dug her claws in and<br />
jumped off Cain&#039;s chest. She noticed the clothes she&#039;d been wearing had<br />
been discarded and moved towards his fluffy dressing gown. She morphed<br />
back from cat form and put it on.</p>
<p>"Penny for them?" she asked him. Then lay down on the bed next to him,<br />
her head resting on his shoulder. "or at least, I&#039;ll tell you what I&#039;m<br />
thinking if you tell me what you&#039;re thinking..."</p>
<p>She sighed and waited for his response.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Not much," murmured Cain.  "Just... the past, and the future; the<br />
Poppies and us...  About how much we missed whilst we were on the<br />
road, and about how much we&#039;re going to miss the road now we&#039;re back."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra raised her head and looked at him properly.</p>
<p>"Well, I promised you my thoughts, but you can&#039;t run away if you don&#039;t<br />
like them, ok?" she told him, he nodded. "I was wondering if it would<br />
be possible to get away with running away with you, just leave our<br />
houses behind for a while and get to know each other better. Also, I&#039;m<br />
a little scared of what your mother would have planned for our wedding<br />
so a part of me wants to elope so we have more control over the wedding<br />
than anyone else." she propped herself up on her elbow and stroked his<br />
cheek. "I&#039;ve always loved you, so now that I know you feel the same, I<br />
want to make sure you can&#039;t be taken away. My house is neutral, but<br />
I&#039;ve been making sure you were prioritised. It&#039;d be nice to just let<br />
the rest of the world get on with it and pick them up where necessary.<br />
So you could say we took your side." she smiled weakly, waiting to see<br />
if he was going to try and run away.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain considered for a moment.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you&#039;re okay with that?  You&#039;re a Duchess now, you<br />
house needs you.  What&#039;ll you do if something political kicks off?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>She thought for a bit, then having made her mind up she told him.</p>
<p>"Of course, I can leave Grizzel and Catkin in charge, they&#039;ve done a<br />
good job of looking after my house while I was grieving and mooching<br />
around here... Also, now that Akane&#039;s back, we could leave her a letter<br />
explaining that she&#039;s temporarily in charge. While I understand my<br />
responsibilities, I also want the freedom to be young for once. You&#039;re<br />
lucky, you didn&#039;t have to see your entire family wiped out and make the<br />
passing easier for them." she looked away for a second to blink away<br />
the tears and negative emotions. "My house has needed a Duchess for<br />
years now, I&#039;m sure a few more weeks or months won&#039;t hurt... it&#039;s not<br />
like we&#039;ll never go back, right? And if something political kicks off<br />
I&#039;ll return and sort it out." she hugged him, her eyes reflecting the<br />
sadness she had been trying to rid herself of.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Alright," said Cain, a smile creeping slowly across his face.  "Why not?"</p>
<p>He walked across the room and picked up a heavy-looking bag.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s not as if I&#039;ve had much time to unpack yet," he said by way of<br />
explanation.  "Come on, let&#039;s go to your room and pick up some<br />
clothes and things for you."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I don&#039;t have that much here... I didn&#039;t think you&#039;d come after me..."<br />
she explained. "I have a dress, and some shoes." Her face lit up as an<br />
idea dawned on her. "I still have my bag." she fished under his bed and<br />
pulled out what was at first sight an unremarkable bag. "I have four<br />
changes of clothes in here, it&#039;ll do... I can always borrow a shirt if<br />
I need to, right?"</p>
<p>They set off down the hallway, pausing for a second for Ilandra to poke<br />
her head into Abel&#039;s room and call out "Right, we&#039;re going home now,<br />
see ya tomorrow Akane!"</p>
<p>She looked at Cain, grabbed his hand and told him, "Now run, before she realises what we&#039;re doing!"</p>
