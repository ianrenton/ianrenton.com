Run time: 2h 30m – more plot was originally planned for this session (with a more satisfying point to break at the end), but the initial planning stage took 1h20m instead of the 30m I expected!<br/><br/>

Planning next move.<br/><br/>

Dust settling behind the party. Ailsa reassures them that the outpost will grow back within hours, and that a mere creature like the one that attacked could be despatched by the Queen with little effort.<br/><br/>

Skyborn presence worrying. Some must have come through the passageway, but they have no leaders.<br/><br/>

A Forestborn army is available if the characters want it. Around 100 men. Trees. Things.<br/><br/>

Venture down into the cavern as before?<br/><br/>

<em>Characters chose to enter first under Ailsa's stealth magic, then have a Forestborn army enter 20 minutes later, beginning by tearing the roof off the cylindrical entrance-well so that sunlight would reach the bottom, and thus Forestborn magic could work at the bottom.  Forestborn sorcerers gave the characters a pouch of seeds that, when planted, would grow explosively -- but the characters not being Forestborn sorcerers themselves, they will not be able to control how the growth occurs.</em><br/><br/>

Skyborn children playing in updraught.  Named Tom and Tam.  Boy + Girl act as age 6-ish.  Say this seemed like a fun place to go. Surprised that the portal was significant.  Ailsa is concerned that even Skyborn children can travel here, but says it is typical of them to just leave the passageway unguarded and open to all to step through.  What do characters do about them?<br/><br/>

At the bottom, met by guards in similar number to how many characters + Forestborn they have.  If a small number, Arken + characters may reason with them. If a large number, pitched battle occurs (run characters in combat vs 6 guards, 4 spear 2 sling).<br/><br/>

Explore deeper into underground realm.  Arken shows them the important bits:
<ul>
	<li>Cells where black soldiers died incl. Captain, guarded by few normal guards.  Captain had a fancy longsword (1d10 18-20x2), purse of gold, scroll announcing the soldiers to all concerned as emissaries of the Duke of Freinal in the kingdom of Western Silat, on a mission of utmost importance to the future safety of the Realm.</li>
	<li>Barracks, best avoided</li>
	<li>Kitchens, comedy relief?</li>
	<li>Lava pits, with rickety pumps pumping it out as an energy source. Tended by diminutive creatures in heat suits.</li>
	<li>...and more that will have to wait until next session!</li>
</ul>

<em>The Forestborn army blew the bloody doors off at this point, and sounds of battle filled the cave as the session ended.</em><br/><br/>
