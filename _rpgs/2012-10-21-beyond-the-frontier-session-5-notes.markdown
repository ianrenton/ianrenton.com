title: Beyond the Frontier -- Session 5 Notes
---

Run time: 2h 30m –- the second half of the previously planned session!  This would have been 2h long but the Earth Elemental, and the characters fighting it, developed a chronic case of the sucking.<br/><br/>

Characters deep in underground realm.  Arken shows them the important bits, at speed as the Forestborn and Earthborn soldiers are now in battle.
<ul>
	<li>Lava pits, with rickety pumps pumping it out as an energy source.  Must be negotiated.  Locker room nearby with suitable equipment for characters to protect from heat, but on the other side of the lava pits.  Diminutive creatures (“Atar”) controlling the apparatus, will work on unless pestered, react with hissing anger if interrupted.  No weapons, AC 10.</li>
	<li>Hopefully power generation apparatus is sabotaged by characters.  This sets off an alarm that lasts for a few minutes before power dies.</li>
	<li>Further on, encounter "royal guards". Earth elemental forms from the wall to block the exit.</li>
	<li>Throne room.</li>
</ul>

In the Throne room, Lord Granite sits backed by the portal much as the Forestborn Queen had.<br/>

He sighs.  “My wizard,” he says simply.  “Deal with them.”<br/><br/>

Once the wizard is despatched, Granite mocks.  “It took long enough for the creatures of this realm to make their pathetic stand before me.”  He notices Ailsa/Forestborn and Arken. “I see you have allies, too. Curious that you should choose to befriend them. And you have some of my property. Interesting.”<br/><br/>

<em>The characters dropped Ailsa and Arken at the Lava Pits, but I blagged Granite's knowledge of them anyway.</em><br/><br/>

He stands.<br/>

“Let's make it more interesting.”<br/>

And steps backwards through the portal.<br/><br/>

End session.<br/><br/>
