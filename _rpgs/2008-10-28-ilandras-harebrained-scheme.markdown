<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Ilandra and Cain slept well that night, their first night of relaxation<br />
in quite some time.  By the time they awoke, it was to the light<br />
of dawn seeping through the eyes in the fabric of the tent and the<br />
bustle of the camp outside.</p>
<p>The army had risen early, as they are wont to do, and already tents<br />
were being pulled down as fires were smouldering away at cooking<br />
breakfast.</p>
<p>Breakfast.  Just <i>how</i> long had it been since Ilandra and Cain had eaten?</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra stirred, opening her eyes and looking around. Cain was sitting<br />
up in the camp bed. Jumping down from her perch on his feet, she<br />
resized to fae shape and stretched. Smoothing her dress slightly she<br />
decided that she looked perfectly fine.</p>
<p>"Morning!" she chirped. "I&#039;m going to go investigate the possibility of breakfast... wanna come?"</p>
<p>She walked to the door bit of the tent and poked her head out. Then<br />
remembering the previous night, left their tent in the direction of the<br />
Baron&#039;s tent.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain followed in a half-asleep daze, his feet being repeatedly poked by<br />
sticks and embers as he had forgotten to put his boots back on.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the Baron&#039;s marquee, the place was a hub of<br />
activity.  Soldiers with bags, and scrolls, and weapons rushed in<br />
and out of various tents of what looked to be the higher-ranking<br />
officers.  From inside the Baron&#039;s tent, two raised voices could<br />
be heard - his, and a girl&#039;s.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m telling you," began the man&#039;s, "you are not ready to be on ze front-"</p>
<p>"Yes I am!  What did I come here for?"</p>
<p>"I don&#039;t-"</p>
<p>"I came here to fight, cousin!  I came here to help the House!  So let me!"</p>
<p>"I-"</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<p>And with that the girl stormed out of the tent.  She wore a black<br />
gown that reached the floor, somehow miraculously not muddy even after<br />
at least one night in a field.  Over it, red beaded jewellery set<br />
off the cherry red of the hair that spilled in waves over her shoulders.</p>
<p>She looked around outside, and found herself uncomfortably close to someone she was not at all expecting to see.</p>
<p>"Ilandra."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra&#039;s eyes glowed a feline shade of green, she narrowed them.</p>
<p>"YOU!" she snarled. "What the hell are YOU doing here?"</p>
<p>By her sides, her hands were involuntarily clenching into fists as though she was preparing for a fight.</p>
<p>"Oh, by the way, it&#039;s Duchess Ilandra... show <i>some</i> respect." she added.</p>
<p><i> &#039;Ugh just what I need, HER turning up and declaring that she would<br />
look far better on Cain&#039;s arm... as if Cain is some accessory...&#039;</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Duchess, eh?  Well, it&#039;s still only House Honeysuckle, isn&#039;t it<br />
-" there was a fraction of a pause, but a very deliberate one - "your<br />
Grace?  And there&#039;s still no <i>Duke</i> Honeysuckle..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"So what if there&#039;s no Duke Honeysuckle?" Ilandra snapped. "Besides,<br />
even being a peasant is better than being the nobody niece of a council<br />
member! At least when I meet new people their first question isn&#039;t &#039;so<br />
who exactly are you?&#039;."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;ll have you know I&#039;m quite well regarded at court!  Better than &#039;I&#039;m sorry, what House was that again?  <i>Is</i> there even one of those?&#039;"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra had been trying to keep her temper at bay, but she was finding it was rapidly fraying.</p>
<p>"Give me one reason not to smack you in front of Cain. Just one." she said, between teeth. "No, actually on second thoughts..."</p>
<p>Ilandra rammed her fist into the other girl&#039;s face.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p><font color="red">Ilandra rolls to punch Jasmine.<br />

<p>Jasmine jumped for Ilandra, but the feline was too quick for her.<br />
With a sullen thud, she ended up face down in the damp earth.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked down at Jasmine. A smile crossed her face, showing elongated eye teeth.<br />
She faded slightly as she looked at the threads.</p>
<p>"Looks like you&#039;re still unlucky in love..." she said, tutting<br />
slightly. "What&#039;s the matter? High status in court not attracting any<br />
nice guys?"</p>
<p>She shook her hand out from the punch, then turned on her heel spraying Jasmine with more mud.</p>
<p>"Well, I&#039;m going to go track down some breakfast..." she said, before turning back to the other girl. "Want a hand up?"</p>
<p>Mischief glinted in her eyes as she proffered her hand.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Why thank you," said Jasmine, her voice heavy with sarcasm.  She took Ilandra&#039;s proffered hand...</p>
<p><font color="red">Jasmine rolls to grapple Ilandra.<br />

<p>...and pulled her down into the mud as she stood up!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra laughed manically.</p>

<p>A surprise gust of wind affecting only Jasmine sweeps her up, taking<br />
her spinning into the air at high speed. She came crashing down face<br />
first 5 feet away.</p>
<p>She picked herself up, dusting her dress down as she did so.</p>
<p>"You know, you never did say what you were doing out here..." she said,<br />
cracking her knuckles and springing onto the other girl&#039;s back.</p>
<p><font color="red">Roll to grapple her.<br />

<p>"Nor-" she gasped.  "Nor did you.  You&#039;re a... long way from... your friends, out here."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>

Jasmine&#039;s arm gave out a sickening snap as Ilandra twisted it.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As Jasmine screamed loud enough to waken the dead, a much quieter but much more sinister sound rang out.  Metal on metal.</p>
<p>And, a few seconds that would have been silent later, a sharp cold feeling on the back of Ilandra&#039;s neck.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra froze. Her anger vanishing to be rapidly replaced by concern.</p>
<p>She let go of Jasmine&#039;s arm.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Stand up slowly, and turn avound," said Baron von Richtoven.  "Jasmine, get up too."</p>
<p>The Red Rose girl&#039;s screams turned to whimpers as she stood.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra stood, her eyes downcast.</p>
<p>"She started it..." she mumbled.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"You," he said to Jasmine.  "Medical tent, now.  If it&#039;s down already, find the First Regiment field surgeons."</p>
<p>"You."  Ilandra.  "Back to your tent, clean up, get ready to<br />
leave.  Help the soldiers put your tent down, that&#039;s your<br />
punishment."</p>
<p>"Prince Cain.  My tent, now, if you please."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Don&#039;t let him have the box." she told Cain as she turned to go back to<br />
her tent. "Oh, erm... have a medical tent. Fully kitted out. Just<br />
please don&#039;t punish Cain for my behaviour."</p>
<p>She pulled a small yellow fabric from her bag and threw it to the ground where it expanded into a tent.</p>
<p>"It&#039;ll be fine for any medics to use." she called as she walked back to their tent.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the tent she rolled her sleeves up. Looking over at the<br />
other soldiers with tears running down her face, she straightened up.</p>
<p>"Please, just let me do this on my own. OK? I&#039;ll even fold it up." she wiped a tear from the tip of her nose. "Just go!"</p>
<p>That said, she went in and retrieved their belongings before dismantling the tent.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Time passed, and eventually - somewhat later than intended - the Third<br />
Division of the Red Rose forces began their half day&#039;s march northwards<br />
to rendezvous with their allies.</p>
<p>Ilandra and Cain rode Hawthorn to one side of the army, whilst Jasmine<br />
rode about as far away from them as possible.  Cain was even<br />
quieter than usual, refusing to be drawn out into any discussion of<br />
what he and the Baron talked about.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>After a short while of Cain&#039;s silence, Ilandra&#039;s lip began to wobble.<br />
She fidgeted in the saddle for a little bit before jumping down and<br />
walking behind Hawthorn, hoping the sound of the other horses would<br />
drown out her tears.<br />
As she hit the ground, she dimly noticed Cain looking concerned.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I haven&#039;t had a chance to eat and I&#039;m just highly strung..."<br />
she offered in explanation. "but I didn&#039;t want to worry you too much...<br />
it&#039;s ok, I&#039;ll get back on Hawthorn if you like."</p>
<p>She accepted his proffered hand to get back on the horse, choosing to<br />
snuggle into his chest instead of looking at where they were going.</p>
<p>"I got you in trouble, didn&#039;t I?" she sobbed. "And that&#039;s why you&#039;re<br />
upset with me... is... do I..." a sob punctuated the sentence. "...am I<br />
still asking the two roses for a favour? I&#039;d... I&#039;d understand if<br />
you... need more time to think"</p>
<p>She gave up on speaking and buried her face in Cain&#039;s chest, holding<br />
onto him like as though he were a life raft in a sea of dangerous<br />
creatures.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain fidgeted in Hawthorn&#039;s saddlebags, and pulled out some trail<br />
rations that had probably seen better days.  He prised one of<br />
Ilandra&#039;s hands free for just long enough to put a thoroughly<br />
inedible-looking piece of meat into it.</p>
<p>"This is all I&#039;ve got, I&#039;m afraid.  I guess we won&#039;t get chance to stop for food until lunch, now."</p>
<p>Cain thought for a while.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I&#039;m not upset with you.  And how could I be in<br />
trouble?  He&#039;s just a Baron.  Were we at war, I could see how<br />
his Barony being twenty times the size of Poppy could be a<br />
problem.  But we&#039;re allies, and while we&#039;re allies, protocol is<br />
still observed."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra handed the piece of meat back.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s OK, I think I still have some biscuits somewhere." she mumbled.<br />
She pulled a bundle of biscuits out of her bag though she didn&#039;t make<br />
any move to eat them. Instead, she stayed snuggled into Cain.</p>
<p>"Can I just stay like this for a little while longer?" she asked, her<br />
eyelids fluttering closed. "I shouldn&#039;t have lost my temper like that,<br />
she makes my blood boil but that&#039;s no excuse. I suppose in a way, it&#039;s<br />
a good thing I didn&#039;t react the way I did with Duke Hyacinth..."</p>
<p>Ilandra dropped the biscuits, preferring instead to cling to Cain.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>After a while, Ilandra stirred. Mischief once again flashed in her<br />
eyes. She looked over at the Rose Viscountess, a mischievous smile<br />
playing on her lips. Making sure she didn&#039;t move her head too far from<br />
Cain&#039;s chest, she concentrated on one of the crossbow bolts on the<br />
saddle.</p>
<p><font color="red">Using Gimmix.<br />
Dex + Melee difficulty 7<br />
You rolled 2 successes using 5d10 with the World of Darkness 1st ed system with a target of 7 ((1,9,3,9,1)).</font></p>
<p>The bolt lifted, flew a couple of feet into the air and then dropped<br />
onto Jasmine&#039;s head. Having achieved her act of mischief, Ilandra<br />
snuggled into Cain.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Ow!" Jasmine said, by luck catching the bolt as it fell.  She<br />
looked at it curiously as she rubbed her head, then counted the number<br />
of bolts in her quiver as she put the strange one back.  She<br />
looked around for anyone who might have had a hand in the strangeness -<br />
particularly that nuisance Ilandra.  But the cat-girl, like<br />
everyone else with whom she travelled, seemed to be paying her no<br />
attention.  Jasmine scowled, unimpressed by the aching head to<br />
accompany her aching arm.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>From Cain&#039;s chest came a low giggle. Ilandra looked up at him.</p>
<p>"So... what did you talk with the baron about?" she asked, casually keeping half an eye on Jasmine.</p>
<p>As he thought of his reply, Ilandra decided to try lifting the pouch.</p>
<p><font color="red"> Gimmix for great mischief.<br />
You rolled 2 successes using 5d10 with the World of Darkness 1st ed system with a target of 7 ((4,6,6,7,10(+3)))</font></p>
<p>The pouch lifted up into the air then dropped onto Jasmine&#039;s head.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Various things," said Cain dismissively.  "The war, and what happened outside the tent this morning, and...  stuff."</p>
<p>Across the other side of the marching column, Jasmine had to wheel her<br />
horse around and dismount to pick up the quiver.  Once mounted<br />
again she snarled at no-one in particular, dug her knees in, and<br />
cantered up to the front of the column to ride alongside her cousin.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra giggled again as she watched Jasmine ride off in irritation. Then fixed her gaze on Cain.</p>
<p>"What kind of stuff?" she asked. "I mean, about this morning..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, you know, he...  He wasn&#039;t expecting something like that<br />
when he woke up in the morning.  He didn&#039;t even remember that you<br />
and Jasmine knew each other, let alone that you had some inexplicable<br />
vendetta going on."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"It&#039;s not inexplicable, there&#039;s a perfectly good reason!" she replied.<br />
"It&#039;s just... it&#039;ll seem silly to you because... well, it&#039;s about<br />
you..."</p>
<p>She looked up at him imploringly.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m sorry, just... I can&#039;t help being slightly territorial... besides,<br />
she talked about you like you were just chattel. I hate that!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Look, this was... how long ago?  Couldn&#039;t you just not try to<br />
tear each other&#039;s throats out for a while?  Annoying Baron von<br />
Richtoven isn&#039;t going to help your goal very much..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Seven years..." she said, pouting. Then did a quick double-take. "Hold<br />
on, two days ago you said we should refer to stuff as OURS! What<br />
happened to ours? It&#039;s our goal... the whole checking satisfaction<br />
thing is a cover story... and the Duke Pansy plan can be dropped at any<br />
stage that you decide to veto it..." she paused for a second to think.<br />
"Actually, yeah it pretty much is my goal isn&#039;t it? I mean, you&#039;re just<br />
making sure I don&#039;t get killed... I&#039;m sorry."</p>
<p>Deciding that she was getting too longwinded, she pulled Cain down to<br />
her level and kissed him, letting him go before he unbalanced.</p>
<p>"How can I make it up to you?" she asked, looking up at him earnestly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Don&#039;t worry about it," said Cain with a sigh.  "Just... let&#039;s get<br />
this bit over with and move on, without getting into any fights.<br />
Especially the big one.  How <i>are </i> we going to avoid that, if we&#039;re spending the whole time with the leaders of the army?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I hadn&#039;t thought that far ahead..." Ilandra admitted, biting her lower<br />
lip. "Maybe I could arrange another pick-up by my house but I don&#039;t<br />
know how or where... Or we could try riding back the way we came..."</p>
<p>She looked thoughtfully at the clouds while she tried to come up with a plan.</p>
<p>"Or we could ask if there&#039;s anyone who could help us get away..." she finished. "With glamour or something..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I suppose there might be," said Cain.  "I&#039;m not sure about riding<br />
back the way we&#039;ve come, though...  Actually, I&#039;m a bit worried<br />
about this.  This is Birch duchy, right?  So where are all<br />
the members of House Birch?  Where&#039;s the roads, and the<br />
villages?  The peasants?  For all the ground we&#039;ve covered in<br />
the last day or so, I&#039;ve not seen any evidence that there&#039;s anyone by<br />
us here..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Perhaps they decided to go stay with allies like your house did..."<br />
Ilandra told him. "Or maybe these are the outskirts and there&#039;s nobody<br />
living here because it doesn&#039;t make for good farming land... Or maybe<br />
this battle was arranged months in advance and the duke was able to<br />
evacuate the area so as to minimise the carnage on his own people... I<br />
don&#039;t know... Perhaps we could ask..."<br />
She stroked his hand absentmindedly as she thought.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I suppose we could," said Cain.  "Though you&#039;re probably right, I<br />
expect it&#039;s just that nobody really wants to live in this bit of the<br />
kingdom."</p>
<p>They rode on, the sun reaching its zenith and then beginning to descend<br />
slowly into the west.  Before too long, the word spread through<br />
the soldiers and eventually to Ilandra that they were reaching the<br />
rendezvous point.  Sure enough, at around two in the afternoon,<br />
the army&#039;s course veered to the east as other marching men and cavalry<br />
appeared in the distance.</p>
<p>Having merged to the officers&#039; satisfaction, the now much larger<br />
combined army - perhaps five times the total size of Baron Richtoven&#039;s<br />
force alone - stopped and set about distributing rations.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>As the rations were handed to Ilandra, she thanked the soldier and asked</p>
<p>"Any idea when we&#039;ll be able to see Duke Rose?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;d imagine pretty much any time, your Grace," replied the<br />
soldier.  "He&#039;ll be up in front, I&#039;m sure.  Just look for the<br />
most impressive tent!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Awesome, thanks!" she said, grabbing her bag and shoving the sandwich<br />
in her mouth and running towards the front of the gathering.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the front she located the most impressive tent, brushed her dress down and approached.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, I was wondering if it&#039;d be possible to see Duke Rose at<br />
all?" she asked a likely looking guard. "I mean, if it&#039;s not too much<br />
of a bother..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"And you are?" asked the guard, as Cain breathlessly ran up behind Ilandra.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Oh yeah, I&#039;m Duchess Honeysuckle..." she said. "And before you ask,<br />
yes there is still one of those and no, I&#039;m not married yet but I will<br />
be eventually. How are you?"</p>
<p><i>damned Jasmine has me on the defensive now...</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"How am...  How am I?" asked the guard.  "I&#039;m... not bad, I<br />
suppose, your Grace.  Considering tomorrow, anyway.  But I,<br />
er...  I wasn&#039;t planning on marrying you.  So you&#039;re, erm,<br />
safe there.  Shall I let the Duke know you&#039;re here?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I didn&#039;t suggest you were planning on marrying me..." Ilandra said,<br />
not unkindly. "Yes, I would like to see the Duke please. Also, good<br />
luck tomorrow..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Your House isn&#039;t...?  Ah, I see.  Well, I&#039;ll let His Grace know you&#039;re here."</p>
<p>The guard disappeared inside the tent, and emerged a few minutes later.</p>
<p>"The Duke will see you, but he says you&#039;ll have to be quick.  We resume marching in fifteen minutes."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Thankyou!" she said. "Well, I&#039;ll probably be seeing you soon unless<br />
you don&#039;t get wounded... or you get killed. Do please take care!"</p>
<p>She entered the tent, fidgeting with her sleeves.</p>
<p>"Good Afternoon, Your Grace. How are you?" she asked, nervously.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Inside the tent, the opulence of the decorations quite put the Baron&#039;s<br />
tent to shame - and all this for only a half-hour lunch break!<br />
Duke David of the House of the Red Rose was quite clearly a man who Got<br />
Things Done.  Or, rather, Got People to Do Things For Him.</p>
<p>Duke Red Rose was a fairly portly chap, clearly no stranger to the<br />
banquet table, and as his current activities demonstrated well, no<br />
stranger to the cigars and the port decanter, either.  He smiled<br />
as Ilandra entered.</p>
<p>"Ah, the Duchess Honeysuckle.  Ilandra, isn&#039;t it?  How can I help you?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra nodded, fidgeting even more with her sleeve not noticing the fabric beginning to tear.</p>
<p>"Well... thing is... er..." she said, her voice rebelling against her.<br />
"That is..." She looked up at him, blushing furiously. "I wanted to get<br />
married and I can&#039;t remember who&#039;s on which side and I wanted to retain<br />
neutrality and I would be really honoured if you could be there to<br />
officiate... please!" she blurted out, only then realising that in her<br />
nerves she&#039;d managed to destroy a sleeve.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Officiate?  At a wedding?" he said.  "Why, I&#039;d be delighted!"</p>
<p>He considered for a moment.</p>
<p>"Is this an &#039;I want to marry my fiancÈ before he goes off to battle<br />
tomorrow&#039; sort of thing, or could it wait a few days?  As you can<br />
probably imagine, I&#039;m not especially well-endowed with free time at<br />
present."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra panicked. Tears formed in her eyes.</p>
<p>"HE&#039;S GOING TO BATTLE?!?" she demanded, clutching the Duke&#039;s sleeve and<br />
beginning to cry. "Please don&#039;t let him go to battle! He said he<br />
wouldn&#039;t!"</p>
<p>Before the duke she melted into tears hugging herself and rocking slightly backwards and forwards.</p>
<p>"He can&#039;t go to battle..." she burbled. "...he mustn&#039;t go..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Pull yourself together, girl!  Who is this man, anyway?  One of mine, I assume?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>She nodded, wiping her tears away with the fragment of her sleeve she&#039;d torn off in her nerves.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m sorry... I just... Haven&#039;t got over the loss of everybody else<br />
yet." she murmured, her cheeks colouring again. She wiped the last of<br />
the tears away and looked up at the man. "Sorry. I wanted... well,<br />
still want... to marry Prince Poppy. I know right now isn&#039;t convenient,<br />
so I was wondering when would be convenient... bearing in mind that in<br />
the interest of preserving neutrality I have to ask the White Rose duke<br />
also."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Poppy?  Well, he&#039;s not one of mine then, dear."  He looked<br />
her up and down.  "The elder one, I take it?  What&#039;s his<br />
name, now...  Cain, is it?"</p>
<p>Ilandra nodded.</p>
<p>"None of my business whether he fights or not, any more.  Not that<br />
I don&#039;t value the Poppies as allies, but they don&#039;t have much of an<br />
army.  I&#039;m still counting on the political support of the Duchess<br />
Poppy, but even if it were my place to, I wouldn&#039;t order them to<br />
battle."</p>
<p>He took a deep swig of port as Ilandra&#039;s last sentence sunk in.</p>
<p>"You&#039;re going to ask Richard as well, eh?  That would make the<br />
ceremony a little... awkward, now, wouldn&#039;t it?  Obviously my<br />
behaviour, and I&#039;d vouch White Rose&#039;s too, would be exemplary.<br />
But there would be a lot of people from both sides there.  How<br />
could you be sure that nobody would try anything... unfortunate?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Just the fact that if any fights break out I&#039;ll have the medics out<br />
sedating them before they can do any harm to anybody. That and the fact<br />
that nobody ever fights at weddings." she said, confidently. "Anyway,<br />
if it causes any problems then I&#039;ll just invite you and the other duke<br />
and nobody else from either side... just I didn&#039;t fancy having to join<br />
the black roses to get a neutral wedding."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m afraid, my dear, one can&#039;t just invite the two most powerful men<br />
in all the land and them alone.  There&#039;s the retinue, the<br />
bodyguards...  Plenty of people who might have uncivil<br />
ideas.  Unless you want to be married right in the middle of a<br />
battlefield before the battle starts - hah! - but that&#039;s the moment the<br />
two of us would have the least people around us.</p>
<p>"If you really insist on keeping things neutral at the wedding, is<br />
there no-one in your own house that could perform the ceremony?<br />
Or if not, what about one of the Trees?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra gave him a look that almost said &#039;are you mentally deficient?&#039; at his last question.</p>
<p>"There&#039;s nobody left in my house... the battle at house Poppy wiped<br />
them out... I believe, they were trying out an ambulance system." she<br />
said. "Though I suppose we could do a battlefield wedding... if we<br />
absolutely must. Can I get back to you on that one in a little bit? I<br />
have to run it past Cain."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Certainly," he said, waving Ilandra from the tent and wondering how he could have made his point any clearer.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra left the tent in a state of mild confusion. As she came out, she bumped into Cain.</p>
<p>"Hey," she said, "I have a question... how do you feel about a<br />
battlefield wedding?" She thought for a second. "Actually, scratch<br />
that, I have a better idea. Next Wednesday is good for you, right?"</p>
<p>She didn&#039;t wait for an answer before re-entering the tent.</p>
<p>"I thought about it further and seeing as the Poppies are red it makes<br />
sense for you to be there... so how&#039;s next Wednesday? We&#039;ll hold it at<br />
my castle so that we can get the whole coronation nonsense out of the<br />
way too..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Wednesday, eh?" asked the Duke.  "Ah, the young, always in a hurry.  Lieutenant Jenkins!"</p>
<p>"Sir?"  A scrawny-looking man in disarrayed uniform appeared from the back of the tent, clutching at a notepad.</p>
<p>"Are we free next Wednesday?"</p>
<p>"Right, oh, um, let me see..." said Jenkins.  "This engagement<br />
should be wrapped up by Friday morning, then they march north...<br />
Another two days to the Ivy border.  Probably a light engagement<br />
there, that&#039;ll bring us to Monday.  Then it&#039;s further north to<br />
Valentine City, that&#039;ll be three to four days of skirmishes to get<br />
there, making it Thursday...  On the assumption that the force<br />
remains strong enough to deal with skirmishers, sir, I&#039;d say Wednesday<br />
next will be relatively uneventful."</p>
<p>"Jolly good.  Well then, your Grace, assuming you&#039;ve come to your<br />
senses and won&#039;t be requiring myself to make any undue preparations in<br />
the way of bodyguards and whatnot, I shall see be there to officiate on<br />
Wednesday.  Honeysuckle, correct?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Yup!" she said. "Honeysuckle. Thank you!!!"</p>
<p>She flashed the Duke a winning smile and popped back out the tent.</p>
<p>"Will you tell your mother?" she asked Cain. "It&#039;s Wednesday next week<br />
and it&#039;ll be at my place rather than yours. Also, could she not invite<br />
too many people... I don&#039;t have enough time to prepare for more than<br />
150 people."</p>
<p>She looked around for a few seconds.</p>
<p>"Now... shall we go look for the beardy man?" she asked, rubbing her<br />
hands together. Noticing the guard again she asked him. "Where would I<br />
find Duke Pansy?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m not completely sure, your Grace," said the Guard.  He turned,<br />
and looked out across the camp.  "There&#039;s a group of tents over<br />
there," he said, pointing.  "They&#039;re not Red Roses&#039;, and since I&#039;m<br />
guessing only the top brass would have tents up for a lunch stop,<br />
that&#039;s probably the Pansy command group."</p>
<p>The guard turned back, and glanced in the direction of Cain, who was<br />
still standing as if the pace of decision-making in the last few<br />
minutes had frozen him to the spot.</p>
<p>"Is he okay?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra poked Cain in the side. He swayed slightly from side to side. She poked again and achieved about the same result.</p>
<p>"I think I broke him..." she mused. "Or in five minutes he&#039;ll explode<br />
into life like he did last time... I&#039;d best move him before anyone<br />
trips over him."</p>
<p>She picked him up, holding him by the legs facing away from her. To a<br />
casual observer, Cain appeared to be bobbing through the crowd.<br />
Carrying him, she wandered towards the Pansy camp where she walked up<br />
to a large tent and asked the guard.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, would it be possible to have a minute with Duke Pansy. I&#039;m duchess Honeysuckle." she said.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"And I&#039;m Prince Cain Poppy," said Cain.  "And you can put me down now."</p>
<p>The guard looked from one to the other and back again, nodded, and stepped inside the tent.</p>
<p>He emerged a minute or so later.</p>
<p>"You can go in," he said simply.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"You were broken, like when I gave you moonshine..." she explained as<br />
they entered the tent. Inside the tent Ilandra turned to Duke Pansy and<br />
bowed. "Hello, I have a massive favour to ask of you... and before you<br />
worry, no I&#039;m not concerned with how many people you wound. Basically,<br />
we&#039;re getting married next Wednesday and I want to personally invite<br />
you...."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Married, eh?" said Duke Pansy, winking at the two of them.  "Well<br />
well well.  I&#039;ll come if I&#039;m not on a battlefield at the<br />
time!"  He laughed uproariously.  "So what&#039;re you doing all<br />
the way out here?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"You&#039;re gonna laugh..." Ilandra said. "Basically, his mother is not<br />
only single but enjoys doing paperwork and you&#039;re a nice man so I<br />
wondered if you wouldn&#039;t mind being her date for the wedding... only<br />
she will insist on spending all her time with me otherwise and you can<br />
appreciate that that&#039;s not a particularly appealing prospect on one&#039;s<br />
wedding day..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Duke Pansy bellowed heartily.  "Damn right I&#039;ll laugh! You want me<br />
to be your mother-in-law&#039;s date to your own wedding?"  He<br />
grinned.  "Well, it&#039;s crazy enough, it might just work! I&#039;m sure I<br />
can bore her with tales of battle and she can bore me with tales of<br />
paperwork, and between &#039;em we&#039;ll have her off your hands!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Thank you!!!" Ilandra cried, leaping up and hugging the other Duke. "I<br />
knew you were awesome! As for boring her with tales of battle, well<br />
from what I hear they&#039;ll be totally fascinating! I mean, just a few<br />
months ago you single-handedly filled up one of our wards..."</p>
<p>She let go of the Duke, smiling.</p>
<p>"Anyway, now I have to find someone to pretend to be my father..." she<br />
said, mostly to herself thoughtfully. "and perhaps a few bridesmaids...<br />
though am I sure I really want bridesmaids? Hmm..."</p>
<p>Turning back to the Duke she put on puppy dog eyes.</p>
<p>"You wouldn&#039;t mind doing the whole walking down the aisle to give the<br />
girl away thing as well would you?" she asked. "Only that otherwise I<br />
have a week to find another Duke willing to do so..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"What about your own- oh," said Pansy, realising he&#039;d just put his foot<br />
in it.  "Right, well.  I suppose so, if there&#039;s no-one you&#039;d<br />
rather have.  At least no-one will try to steal you!  Hahaha!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Thanks!" she said. "If there&#039;s anything I can do for you in return,<br />
just let me know... otherwise, I&#039;ll be seeing you soon! Oh and do try<br />
to not get hurt, I&#039;ll be worrying about you if you do..."</p>
<p>She turned to leave the tent, grabbing Cain&#039;s hand.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Pansy laughed again.  "Hurt?  Hah.  I don&#039;t think you<br />
need to worry, somehow!  Enjoy the rest of being single, and I&#039;ll<br />
be seeing you in a week!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Yup, see you then. Though I&#039;ll still worry..." she replied. "You look like you need somebody to worry over you occasionally..."</p>
<p>She left the tent, dragging Cain behind her.</p>
<p>"I can&#039;t think of any sensible places nearby that might be weak enough<br />
for a pick up..." she said. "We could just stick with the troops for<br />
now, I guess. What do you think?"</p>
<p>She fixed Cain with a concerned look.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I suppose so," said Cain, his tone of voice betraying how un-keen he<br />
really was.  "But they&#039;re going to be fighting tomorrow.  I&#039;d<br />
rather not...  Well, you know.  I&#039;d rather not get any more<br />
involved than I need to."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"No, it&#039;s OK... Let&#039;s go find Hawthorn, the nearest weak spot is over<br />
that crest..." she said pointing in the general direction they&#039;d been<br />
marching in. "Are we going to stay in my house or do you want to brave<br />
your mother today?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Yours, I think.  Um, if that&#039;s okay.  The last half hour has<br />
been a bit... crazy.  I think I&#039;d like to sleep on things before I<br />
have to explain them to my mother."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Right. Well, in that case we&#039;d best get moving." she said, her mind<br />
trying to work out how to get to the white camp on her own. They walked<br />
towards Hawthorn as the troops readied themselves for the afternoon&#039;s<br />
march. Once mounted, they followed the other troops. "Looks like<br />
they&#039;re going our way after all..." Ilandra commented.<br />
Sensing Cain&#039;s mood, she turned slightly to hug him and snuggle into his arms.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked pensive as they rode, then turned to Cain and asked for<br />
a candle. He rummaged in Hawthorn&#039;s saddlebags and handed her one.<br />
She dredged in her bag and pulled out a pencil and some paper and wrote<br />
a quick note which she sealed up using her ring and the wax. Satisfied<br />
at this, she pointed out the fork in the road where they&#039;d be<br />
separating from the rest of the troops. The feeling they had when they<br />
entered returned as they reached the edge of Birch land and as they<br />
entered the crisp spring sunshine of Honeysuckle it dispersed. Ilandra<br />
made a mental note of this entry, deciding that she&#039;d be re-entering<br />
Birch on her own later on.<br />
"Well, we&#039;re home... sort of." she said, gesturing at the cottage. "I&#039;m<br />
just going to put Hawthorn in the stables, so if you go in and ask<br />
Catkin to put you up in the guest chamber..."<br />
She handed him the letter to give to Catkin, explaining that it had<br />
some instructions about her wedding dress. Then watched him go into the<br />
cottage. Once he was inside she turned to Hawthorn.<br />
"Right, I have a plan... I need you to carry me back to Birch lands...<br />
And I&#039;m sorry to say, but the quicker the better." she said. "You see,<br />
I never asked the white duke and I need to but I can&#039;t let Cain come<br />
along because he&#039;ll get killed. I&#039;m sure he wouldn&#039;t mind..."<br />
Inside the cottage, Catkin opened the letter which merely said:<br />
<i>Don&#039;t let him leave the cottage until I come back, keep him inside by any means necessary.<br />
I&#039;ll be back as soon as I can...<br />
Ilandra</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"You&#039;re going to <i>what</i>?"<br />
asked Hawthorn incredulously.  "This is quite a risk.<br />
Granted, Cain&#039;s life would be in more danger, but you and I are by no<br />
means guaranteed to be treated in a friendly manner by the Whites."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"That&#039;s true, however you run faster than I do and if they attack me on<br />
my own I&#039;d find it hard to get away." she said. "Besides, you&#039;re a<br />
warhorse... you know more about battlefields than I ever will... So I&#039;d<br />
totally appreciate your help... please? I&#039;ll give you all the apples<br />
and carrots you can eat when we get back!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"It sounds," said Hawthorn, slowly, "distressingly like you were planning on going on your own if I said no."</p>
<p>He thought for a moment.  "That being the case, I will carry<br />
you.  But we must be very quick.  It would be dangerous to<br />
remain in the Whites&#039; camp for too long, and it also unnerves me to be<br />
too far from the Prince.  Furthermore, I recommend you change my<br />
tack for some belonging to your house, or at least some that is<br />
undecorated."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I don&#039;t know how to..." she admitted. "How about I just add some honeysuckle details to your current er... tack...?"</p>
<p>She pulled out her scissors and cut a medic tabard in half, attaching it to the saddle as if it were a blanket.</p>
<p>"Right, well I covered all the pictures of poppies..." she said. Then<br />
she looked over at the cottage, the door was still closed. "Can we get<br />
going yet? I don&#039;t know how long it&#039;ll be before Cain figures that I&#039;m<br />
not going in...."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Right.  Let&#039;s get going.  Plenty of time on the road ahead<br />
for you to think up ways of explaining this to the Prince..."</p>
<p>With that, Hawthorn cantered off down the path away from Honeysuckle Cottage, out into wherever the border took them.</p>
<p>Before too long they passed through the unnerving, shimmering barrier<br />
of Honeysuckle&#039;s border, and out into Birch land again.  This<br />
time, as before, they stared down a slight incline towards an army at<br />
camp.  There was no mistaking that these were Whites,<br />
however.  None of the red and gold adornment that characterised<br />
Red Rose and Pansy&#039;s camps was present here.  Their army was<br />
smaller than the approaching reds&#039;, that was for certain, but they<br />
seemed... grittier.  Nothing was wasted here, there was no<br />
luxury.  It looked for all the world like the officers camped no<br />
better than the ordinary men.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, this is a lot different to what I expected..." Ilandra said. "How long before we get there?"</p>
<p>She looked up at the sky, trying to figure out the time, idly noting by the setting sun that it was early evening.</p>
<p>"It looks like it&#039;ll only really be a meal we&#039;ll be interrupting and<br />
not waking anyone up if we get there in the next hour so... at least we<br />
won&#039;t get into too much trouble..." she said.</p>
<p>They rode on for a little while, Ilandra pulling on a medic tabard over<br />
her jacket to emphasise the fact that she wasn&#039;t a red. As they<br />
approached, she fretted slightly over her clothing... checking and<br />
double checking that she was wearing no red or white. She wasn&#039;t, after<br />
becoming fully satisfied that her yellow dress and pale pink jacket<br />
were neither red nor white she adjusted her signet ring.</p>
<p>"Do you think they&#039;ll accept my neutrality?" she asked Hawthorn, after<br />
fretting for a while. "I&#039;m not sure, cause Cain&#039;s red and they might<br />
think I&#039;m on his side when I&#039;m clearly not on any side..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I doubt that they even know about your relationship with the Prince,"<br />
said Hawthorn.  "So long as you introduce yourself properly, you<br />
will likely come to no harm."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>They were nearing the front of the camp by that stage and Ilandra straightened herself up.</p>
<p>"Good evening," she said to a guard that was eyeing her up<br />
suspiciously. "I&#039;m Duchess Honeysuckle and I was wondering if I&#039;d be<br />
able to see Duke Rose please."</p>
<p>She thought for a split second before adding.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I mean Duke White Rose..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Hah," said the guard, "well, I didn&#039;t think you&#039;d mean <i>Red</i> Rose..."  He turned.  "Sergeant Major, Sir!  A visitor, sir!"</p>
<p>A stout fellow appeared from a nearby tent, and made his way to the guards&#039; position.</p>
<p>"The Duchess Honeysuckle, sir!" said the guard.</p>
<p>"Well, well," said the Sergeant Major, waddling toward Ilandra.<br />
"If I may see your ring, your Grace?  No offence, you understand,<br />
but security&#039;s pretty tight around here."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Sure." she said, holding her hand out to show the man. Being sure to keep it just out of his reach as he looked.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The Sergeant Major examined it as best he could, then nodded and stepped out of her and Hawthorn&#039;s way.</p>
<p>"Who are you here to see, your Grace?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, as I said to your guard here, I&#039;m here to see Duke Rose. If I<br />
may." she said, keeping her voice level. "I won&#039;t keep him long, I&#039;m<br />
aware that you have an early start and all that..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Thank you, your Grace.  If you ride in that direction," he said,<br />
pointing into the camp, "about four hundred yards, you should find the<br />
command tents.  His will be the most heavily guarded, I&#039;m<br />
sure.  Just ask someone if you get lost."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Thank you!" she said, as Hawthorn began walking in the direction that<br />
the soldier had pointed. Upon reaching a heavily guarded tent she<br />
dismounted and walked up to a guard.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, would this be Duke Rose&#039;s tent?" she asked. "And if so, may I just pop in and see him? I&#039;m Duchess Honeysuckle..."</p>
<p>She flashed her signet ring at the guard, watching as he ducked inside<br />
the tent to check with his superiors. After a few seconds he popped<br />
back out and waved her in. She thanked him before entering the tent.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Your Grace." she said, bowing to the Duke. "I was<br />
wondering if I could ask you a favour... See, I&#039;m getting married next<br />
Wednesday and I wanted you to be there officiating..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Duke White Rose looked up from a map, at least six feet in each<br />
direction, spread out on a table before him.  "Honeysuckle,<br />
hmm?  Well, in principle I have no objections.  However, I<br />
must ask - why me?  I would seem rather an odd choice, wouldn&#039;t<br />
you agree?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I know..." she said. "But seeing as he&#039;s technically a red, having a<br />
white do the whole thing would make people believe he&#039;s serious about<br />
the whole neutrality thing. Besides, there&#039;s nobody from my house to do<br />
it... Please?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"There will, then, inevitably be a number of Reds there, and a number<br />
of Whites.  You realise, I assume, that extra... security measures<br />
would have to be taken?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"That&#039;s perfectly fine by me. Put in whatever security measures you see<br />
fit." she said. "After all, I wouldn&#039;t want you to get harmed at all<br />
during the wedding or the celebrations."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Indeed.  Nor would I, nor would I.  This wedding is to be at your... castle, yes?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Yup!" she said. "At my castle. Though it still looks like a cottage...<br />
I can&#039;t quite work out how to reverse that... Will you be there?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I will," said Duke Richard with a slight bow.  "Now then, if you will excuse me..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Thanks!" she called, ducking out of the tent and running towards<br />
Hawthorn. "Right, Hawthorn... best return you before your master has<br />
kittens!"</p>
<p>She waved goodbye to the guard as Hawthorn began to walk out of the<br />
camp toward the spot where they&#039;d entered. The weird feeling coming<br />
over them once again as they went through the border between Birch and<br />
Honeysuckle. Upon reaching the stables, Ilandra dismounted and keeping<br />
a hand on Hawthorn asked him to talk her through the removal of the<br />
tack.</p>
<hr />

<p>Hawthorn did so, slowly, trying to build Ilandra&#039;s confidence.</p>
<p>"So," he said as Ilandra unhitched the saddle, "anything to put off having to explain this to Cain, eh?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"No," she said. "If i don&#039;t take all this off you then you&#039;ll be really<br />
uncomfortable and Cain&#039;ll shout because I haven&#039;t taken care of you...<br />
that and I haven&#039;t yet worked out how to explain it to him..."</p>
<p>She put the saddle carefully down and returned to Hawthorn&#039;s side.</p>
<p>"Do I have to brush you down now or will you be ok?" she asked, anxious to do the right thing.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Brushing would be appreciated," said Hawthorn, snorting.  "It&#039;s<br />
been a while since I&#039;ve been in anything resembling a stable.  I&#039;m<br />
sure the Prince will understand your reasons eventually.  He just<br />
might be a little annoyed to start with."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>She grabbed up a brush and started brushing the horse down, paying particular attention to his instructions.</p>
<p>"So you think he&#039;ll understand?" she asked, eventually, as she finished<br />
brushing him down. "Well, I suppose we&#039;ve kept him waiting long<br />
enough... Wish me luck!"</p>
<p>With a final pat on Hawthorn&#039;s neck, she left the stables and walked into the cottage.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Ilandra eventually found Cain in the library, staring out of the window<br />
across the gardens of Honeysuckle cottage.  He didn&#039;t turn around<br />
as his fiancÈe entered the room.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Hi..." she said, quietly. "Sorry for just disappearing like that..."</p>
<p>She fidgeted quietly with a sleeve, approaching him slowly.</p>
<p>"I had a couple of loose ends that needed sorting out... so I sorted<br />
them out, I didn&#039;t think you&#039;d mind that much..." she said, tentatively<br />
reaching out for him. "I&#039;m really sorry, and next time I&#039;ll tell you<br />
before I go..."</p>
<p>She put her hand on his arm, gently as though to test the severity of his annoyance.</p>
<p>"And I had to remove Hawthorn&#039;s tack and brush him down." she said,<br />
trying and failing to keep the pride out of her voice at her<br />
achievement. "I&#039;m still sorry for disappearing on you like that... I<br />
really won&#039;t do it again."</p>
<p>She gripped his arm softly, pulling him towards her gently.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"You went to see the White Roses, didn&#039;t you?" asked Cain slowly,<br />
resisting Ilandra&#039;s pull on his arm.  "You could have just asked,<br />
you know.  Without any of this trying to keep me prisoner<br />
here.  I realise why I couldn&#039;t go, and...  I&#039;m quite<br />
surprised you made it back alive too."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I said I was sorry..." she said. "Besides, why would they kill me? I&#039;m not on either side. And you&#039;re not prisoner..."</p>
<p>Ilandra idly wondered whether Catkin had shown Cain the note... then<br />
decided to pretend she hadn&#039;t written it unless shown the note.</p>
<p>"I&#039;d never keep you prisoner..." she lied. "You were perfectly free to leave..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"That&#039;s not quite the way your butler put it," said Cain.  "He was<br />
most insistent that I needed to stay here, but wouldn&#039;t say why..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, I might have asked nicely for you to still be here when I<br />
returned..." she said, looking down at the floor. "Besides, don&#039;t<br />
prisoners get locked up in dungeons? You&#039;ve not been locked up,<br />
therefore you&#039;re not a prisoner..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Huh," said Cain, turning back to the window.  He stood for a minute or more, looking out into the gardens.</p>
<p>"I take it White Rose accepted, then?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Sort of..." she said, neglecting to tell him details. "I think it best<br />
we don&#039;t tell too many people though, he said something about not<br />
wanting anyone to know they don&#039;t mind being seen together..."</p>
<p>She took a step forward and put her arms around Cain.</p>
<p>"Look, I&#039;m sorry... I thought you&#039;d follow me and I didn&#039;t want to risk<br />
your life..." she said, holding him tightly enough that he couldn&#039;t<br />
just wriggle away. "I know it was unfair and I promise you I&#039;ll never<br />
do it again. I understand if you want to go back home tonight, but I&#039;d<br />
like you to stay and I&#039;ll give you my set of master keys so that you<br />
can go anywhere you like..."</p>
<p>She reached into her bag and pulled out a bundle of keys, keeping one<br />
arm around him. Then she put the keys into his hand, let go of him and<br />
walked back towards the door.</p>
<p>"I&#039;ll be in the drawing room downstairs, let me know if you forgive<br />
me." she said, deciding that perhaps the best way to solve the argument<br />
is to acknowledge she&#039;s lost it.</p>
