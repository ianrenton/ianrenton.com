<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Ilandra opened her eyes, and was briefly seized with the panic of all<br />
those who find themselves newly blind.  Then she tried again, and<br />
managed it that time.</p>
<p>The world blurred back and forth in front of her, though she was still<br />
somewhat preoccupied with the joy of not actually having lost her sight<br />
after all.  By feeling around her and blinking rapidly, she put<br />
together enough of a picture of her surroundings to figure out that she<br />
was indoors, but no longer in the inn.  Morning sunlight shone in<br />
through the windows and onto the rough straw bed, on which she lay next<br />
to Cain.  Both still wore the same clothes they had arrived in.</p>
<p>Ilandra started to roll towards Cain, and immediately regretted<br />
it.  Her stomach was not in a friendly mood, and her mouth felt as<br />
if some malign entity had spent the previous evening filling it with<br />
adhesive mice.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>She groaned, then froze to forestall a repeat performance of the previous day&#039;s reaction to hangovers.<br />
<i>Ugh, again... what did I do to deserve this?</i><br />
She experimented with opening her mouth, it was still possible.<br />
"mmm never drinking again...." she mumbled angrily. Then experimented with rolling reeeeally slowly the other way.<br />
<i>if my stomach hates me, at least cain won&#039;t suffer if I go this way.</i><br />
Having managed to take half an hour to get to the floor, she almost<br />
lost the contents of her stomach when Cain poked his head over the edge<br />
of the bed to check she was ok.<br />
"Your mum, she hates my head." she grumbled, then grabbed her aching<br />
head and sank to the floor. "gonna find water, wash the mice out. These<br />
people have mouse glue."</p>
<p>Having managed what she thought was epic amounts of explanation,<br />
Ilandra dragged herself to the door, where she spent a good minute or<br />
so working her way up to turning the handle. Though this proved<br />
unnecessary when Cain handed her a mug of water which she decimated.<br />
Noting the lack of any other drinks she went for the door handle again.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Ilandra landed heavily on the door handle, pushing it down and the door<br />
open in one swift and graceless movement.  Still not completely in<br />
command of her balance, she fell uncomfortably to the floor.</p>
<p>On the way down, she saw a huddle of people in the room beyond, engaged<br />
in whispered conversation.  Jebodiah and his son were there, along<br />
with two other men whom Ilandra had not seen before.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>She looked up. "Hiiii!" she managed, trying to sound really surprised<br />
(which to be fair she was). She smiled wearily as Cain strode from the<br />
room, picking her up on the way out.</p>
<p>"Hope I didn&#039;t interrupt anything..." she said as he righted her and allowed her to hold on to him for balance.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Mornin&#039; Kate, Ger&#039;ld," said Jebodiah.  "Oi see one&#039;a ya&#039;s a bit<br />
t&#039;worse fer wear, a&#039;least.  Oi&#039;ll fetch ya&#039; some breakfast in a<br />
bit if yer in t&#039;mood, but roight now Oi&#039;ve got some ver&#039; import&#039;nt<br />
bus&#039;ness ta deal with."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Breakfast?" Ilandra turned a slightly green shade. "&#039;scuse me a sec"</p>
<p>She sank down to the floor, where, still steadied by Cain&#039;s leg where she swayed a little trying not to be ill.</p>
<p>"Right, sorry &#039;bout tha&#039;... couldja no&#039; mention food righ&#039; now?" she<br />
asked, holding her stomach. "&#039;less you need the room for other stuff...<br />
cos we could leave ya to i&#039; an&#039; see to the sick guys."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Ah, roight, sorry," said Jebodiah.  "Boi all means see to &#039;em if<br />
ye think ye&#039;re up t&#039;it.  Oi&#039;ll come see ya&#039; in a bi&#039;.  Oi<br />
think Oi moight &#039;ave summat else ya can &#039;elp us wi&#039;, as well as th&#039;<br />
injured lads."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p><i> going to see their infected wounds might set me off, however, leaving them to fester is just as bad</i></p>
<p>"Well, er... ok, let&#039;s go see to the men." Ilandra said, lurching to<br />
her feet. "Nothing like festering wounds to help a hangover..." she<br />
mumbled turning slightly green.</p>
<p>Leaning on the doorpost she turned to Cain. "C&#039;mon then."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain followed Ilandra out into the misty morning, supporting her every<br />
few steps as her hung-over swayings threatened to topple her.<br />
They made their way to the temporary hospital at the end of the village.</p>
<p>It didn&#039;t smell any better than yesterday; in fact it smelt rather<br />
worse.  A couple of the patients looked like they&#039;d managed to<br />
fall asleep eventually, one possibly with the aid of a bottle of<br />
moonshine that now lay on the floor beside him.  Others looked<br />
like they hadn&#039;t rested at all, and were still whining and groaning<br />
just as they had the previous evening.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Digging around in her bag, Ilandra pulled out a little sachet of hops.<br />
Extracting one and putting it in her mouth Ilandra grimaced and chewed<br />
on it while looking the patients over.</p>
<p>After a minute or two, she and Cain went to the well where they filled<br />
a couple of buckets and returned to wash out the wounds. As they walked<br />
back Ilandra turned to Cain and said, "Hey Cain, how did we end up in a<br />
bed last night? Cos I fell asleep on your leg..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Ah.  I was wondering when you&#039;d get around to asking that.<br />
You see, er...  After you fell asleep, Jebodiah and I sat in<br />
awkward silence for a while, since I couldn&#039;t speak without blowing our<br />
cover and it seemed like Jebodiah had nothing much to say.  Well,<br />
the minutes wore on, and the old man got slowly more and more drunk,<br />
and more and more fed up.  Eventually, well...  I was<br />
expecting him just to give up and go sit at another table, but he<br />
didn&#039;t.  He sighed, and said &#039;Look, I know, alright?&#039;.</p>
<p>"I looked kind of startled at that point, but still didn&#039;t say anything<br />
until he elaborated.  &#039;I know who you are.  So you can talk<br />
if you like,&#039; he said.  So... I did."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"oh..." Ilandra said, looking at a point of the ground not too far<br />
forward from where they walked. "So, what did you talk about? Anything<br />
interesting?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Politics, mainly," said Cain.  "He has much bigger plans than I&#039;d<br />
expected.  He also said he wanted our help with them..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I don&#039;t see how I can help with politics... I used to fall asleep in<br />
the lessons..." Ilandra said. "Unless it&#039;s not tuition he wants..."</p>
<p>The last sentence re-parsed itself in her mind.</p>
<p>"Oh he wants us to help him with his plans!" she said. "Sure, why not?<br />
It&#039;s not like we&#039;re in any mad rush, right? Only if you want to though."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, I have to admit...  I&#039;m quite in favour.  I&#039;m not sure<br />
how far he&#039;s planning to take this plan of his, but I wouldn&#039;t put it<br />
past him to try to depose Duke Hyacinth.  I&#039;m not sure quite what<br />
he thinks will happen then - the kingdom needs a ruler, and I doubt a<br />
commoner could take the place of a Duke - but he&#039;s promised favourable<br />
agreements with House Poppy in exchange for us helping him.  And,<br />
well...  What with how badly we suffered due to Duke Hyacinth&#039;s<br />
two-faced scheming, I&#039;d be inclined to favour just about anything over<br />
him!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra thought about it for a moment. "I don&#039;t know the rules behind<br />
it, but I don&#039;t mind helping him if you want to. Though if he hurts you<br />
in any way, he&#039;d better start fearing for his existence!" she said.<br />
"Sorry, not that you wouldn&#039;t hurt back equally... just my territorial<br />
instincts taking over for a second..." looking decidedly sheepish, as<br />
she trailed off, she looked up to notice her surroundings. Putting the<br />
two buckets she was carrying down on the ground, she pulled Cain down<br />
to her height and kissed him.</p>
<p><i>cos hey, it&#039;s been ages and stuff</i></p>
<p><font color="red">ooc: it had been ages</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain and Ilandra embraced for a good long while, making up for lost<br />
time.  When at last they broke apart, Cain stretched back to his<br />
full height, and from there saw Jebodiah waiting for them at the<br />
makeshift hospital.  His face turned from joyous to serious.</p>
<p>"Well, guess who it is," Cain said with a sigh.  "Looks like it&#039;s time for the serious stuff again..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Damn it, why is it all work and no play?" Ilandra grumbled, picking<br />
her two buckets back up. "Mind you, I suppose we sorta volunteered for<br />
this... though when we get the chance to just duck off and be alone, we<br />
are so taking it."</p>
<p>"&#039;llo again Jebodiah." she said, as they approached. "&#039;Ow c&#039;n we help?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, ah," began Jebodiah.  "Look, ye can stop wi&#039; t&#039;voice now,<br />
if ye loikes.  We&#039;re &#039;lone &#039;ere.  Now there ain&#039;t no easy way<br />
ta&#039; break this to ya&#039; if yer man ain&#039;t already, but...  I knows<br />
who y&#039;are.  Always &#039;ave, Oi&#039;m &#039;fraid."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Oh alright then." she said in a voice not that far removed from her<br />
peasant accent. She noticed the look from Jebodiah. "What? I actually<br />
talk like this normally. Unless I&#039;m visiting his mum in which case" she<br />
pauses and slips into received pronounciation "One talks all posh<br />
like..."</p>
<p>"Anyway, what can I do for you?" she asked in her normal voice. (for reference, she talks just like I do)</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Jebodiah looked somewhat confused at Ilandra&#039;s outburst, then appeared<br />
to file the confusion away for future reference as his face returned to<br />
its normal serious expression.</p>
<p>"Well&#039;n, Ilandra, Cain," he said, "If ya&#039;d loike ta&#039; foller me back<br />
t&#039;the house, we&#039;s can talk &#039;bout what&#039;s a&#039;happenin and whether ye want<br />
ta be involved or not."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Ok" Ilandra said and followed him, being sure to shoot a glare at Cain.</p>
<p><i> I wonder what he wants...</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>At Jebodiah&#039;s house, the men with whom he was in conversation with<br />
earlier were idly chattering as the elder and the two nobles<br />
entered.  They looked up and immediately separated to standing<br />
apart and looking formal, as if the old man might have told them off<br />
for talking in class.</p>
<p>Jebodiah sat down heavily in his chair at the centre of the room, leaving Ilandra and Cain standing in front of him.</p>
<p>"Now&#039;n," he said, "T&#039;day is a most... auspic&#039;s day.  T&#039;day, or<br />
mebbe t&#039;morrow by time we get there, we&#039;s goin&#039; ta speak to Mister<br />
Hy&#039;cinth.  Y&#039;can prolly guess, a meetin&#039; between one concern&#039;d wi&#039;<br />
the fate o&#039; &#039;is people loike me, and one who abuses &#039;em in &#039;is manner<br />
ain&#039;t gonna be &#039;tic&#039;ly friendly.  An&#039; on &#039;way, o&#039;course, this<br />
country&#039;s swarmin&#039; wi&#039; soldiers.  So, what Oi&#039;d loike... is for<br />
you ta help us."</p>
<p>He paused for breath.</p>
<p>"Now you, Mister Poppy," he said, looking at Cain, "we&#039;s already<br />
discussed &#039;ow the world moight jus&#039; be a better place for the both of<br />
us if Mister Hy&#039;cinth weren&#039;t in charge no more.  Bu&#039; you, Miss<br />
Honeysuckle...  From what Oi &#039;eard, there ain&#039;t a lot we&#039;s can<br />
offer ya&#039;.  If ye can think&#039;a anything Oi could grant ya&#039; in<br />
&#039;change, ya&#039;s welcome t&#039;it.</p>
<p>"Now, we leave a&#039;noon.  If you two got things ta&#039; talk about, an&#039;<br />
Oi&#039;m guessan y&#039;prolly do, ya got &#039;till then if you&#039;s comin&#039;."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, I was wondering if I could maybe speak to one or two of the<br />
ladies in the village... teach them the basics of wound care..."<br />
Ilandra said "Just so that your guys in there get better soon... oh,<br />
and just call me Ilandra, everyone else does"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Roight.  Yes, okay," said Jebodiah, as if he had previously<br />
forgotten all about his dying men.  "Oi&#039;m sure you&#039;ll foind a<br />
number&#039;a loikely ladies in t&#039;inn, wishing for summat better ta do than<br />
clear up las&#039; noight&#039;s mess.  Either way, if ye&#039;s resolved ta&#039;<br />
comin&#039; wi&#039; us, be back &#039;ere and packed a&#039; noon."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p><i> I haven&#039;t unpacked yet... still at least I didn&#039;t have to take the ring off in the end.</i></p>
<p>"OK." she said, running off to the inn. As she burst in she was greeted by the tired gazes of the women inside.</p>
<p>"Right, ladies. I have a job for all of you!" she said. "Now who wants to do something useful and learn how to treat wounds?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Ilandra&#039;s offer was greeted with replies ranging from wide-eyed<br />
enthusiasm to weary indifference.  All things considered, by the<br />
time the women had finished fussing around and debating amongst<br />
themselves, Ilandra had a reasonably respectable four volunteers to<br />
learn the gory ins and outs of caring for the wounded.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra proceeded to teach them all the basics of wound care. Then<br />
handed one of the women a picture and told them about feverfew and how<br />
it could be used to alleviate fevers. Then she told them of the merits<br />
of willow bark and told them that if they couldn&#039;t find either willow<br />
or feverfew they could use some honeysuckle.</p>
<p>She put her hand to the ground and a sizable japanese honeysuckle bush sprouted up.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The women stopped and stared as Ilandra produced a full-grown<br />
honeysuckle bush from previously-bare ground.  They looked guilty<br />
as Ilandra turned around to face them as if she&#039;d just done the most<br />
trivial thing in the world.</p>
<p>"We, ah..." said the eldest after a few seconds.  "We don&#039;t mean<br />
no dis&#039;pect or nowt, but...  &#039;ow in the blazes can ye do tha&#039;?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>It suddenly dawned on Ilandra that peasantry weren&#039;t capable of such things.</p>
<p>"A handful of seeds and some liquid compost?" she said, hopefully. "Oh<br />
nevermind, look. It doesn&#039;t matter, ok?" As she said this her eyes<br />
glowed slightly.</p>
<p><font color="red">Roll for fuddle: difficulty 6. 4 dice. 2 successes.</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Yeah, you&#039;s roight," said the woman.  "It don&#039;t matter, roight ladies?"</p>
<p>There was a vaguely affirmative mumble from the other three.</p>
<p>"So," the eldest continued, "how&#039;d ye say one uses this &#039;gain?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"You grind up the flowers and buds in a pestle and mortar and smear the<br />
paste onto the wounds. Or you can make a tea of the stems and drink it.<br />
Failing that you can grind up the flowers and make them into a syrup<br />
and feed it to the sick person" she reminded them. At this point she<br />
noticed the sun getting to its noontime position.</p>
<p>"Sorry, ladies. I gotta run Jebodiah wanted something about noonish." so saying she and Cain rushed off to the meeting point.</p>
<p>As they reached Jebodiah&#039;s hut, Ilandra asked him if they&#039;d be needing the horse (though she still called it a death machine).</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Death m&#039;chine?" asked Jebodiah.  Cain quickly explained, before carrying on inside the cottage.</p>
<p>"Oh, roight," said Jebodiah.  "Well, ah, it&#039;d certainly come in<br />
&#039;andy, though there&#039;d be more&#039;a us than it can carry.  Besoides,<br />
don&#039;t it belong to yer man?  I ain&#039;t sure &#039;e&#039;d want ta&#039; leave it<br />
&#039;ere."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well it is his." she said. "How far are we going anyway?"</p>
<p>"Just as far as the cassle, on&#039;y a day&#039;s walk away." he answered.</p>
<p><i> ooooh fun(!) I wonder if Cain&#039;ll let me ride on his shoulders... or hold his hand...</i> Ilandra blushed and tried to hide it by ducking behind Cain.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain turned and grinned at Ilandra.  "Don&#039;t you worry," he<br />
said.  "I won&#039;t make you ride him this time.  We don&#039;t have<br />
enough horses to go around, so we&#039;ll have to go at walking pace<br />
anyway."  He knelt down and hugged Ilandra.  "I&#039;d better go<br />
and fetch him, we&#039;re leaving soon.  Would you like to come with me<br />
to the stable, or are you staying here for a while?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra dug her fingers into his coat as a signal for him to take her with him.</p>
<p>"Promise he won&#039;t tread on me..."she said in a small voice. He nodded<br />
and she joined him on the way to the stable, half hiding behind him the<br />
entire way.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Come on now, has he ever trodden on you before?  I assure you, he&#039;s very careful."</p>
<p>Once they had wondered out of earshot of Jebodiah, Cain turned more<br />
serious.  "I do wonder about the old man&#039;s plans, you know.<br />
It&#039;s clear he wants power &#039;for the people&#039; at the expense of Duke<br />
Hyacinth, and I guess the Poppies are okay with that, but...  I<br />
wonder how far he intends to take it."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well from what I heard, Duke Hyacinth has it coming..." she said.<br />
"Besides, I don&#039;t know how the dynamics of it work..." She shrugged.<br />
"Though, really, as far as I&#039;m concerned whatever you say goes. Also,<br />
THAT may not have trodden on me yet, but it might decide that you<br />
belong to it and stuff...I don&#039;t know, are those things territorial?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Territorial?  You mean horses?" asked Cain.  "I&#039;m not sure<br />
they are; I think they&#039;re sort of a &#039;roaming free across the prairies&#039;<br />
kind of animal.  Besides, this is Hawthorn."</p>
<p>Having reached the half-disintegrated stables, in which his was the<br />
only horse, Cain began to untie him as he continued.  "It&#039;s not as<br />
if he can&#039;t make up his own mind about things, is it?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Okay, in which case." she turned to the horse. "Listen, Mr. Horse. I<br />
don&#039;t want my feet trodden on and Cain is MY territory and not yours.<br />
He owns you, and in the event that you challenge me I will think<br />
nothing of treading on your feet. Are we in agreement?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Hawthorn snorted and what almost looked like an affirmative nod.<br />
Seemingly pleased, Cain finished untying the horse, and led him out of<br />
the stable.</p>
<p>"Right then," said Cain.  "Shall we head back to the others?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra nodded and followed Cain and Hawthorn out of the stable.</p>
<p>"I&#039;ll call a truce with this one, but I still don&#039;t like horses that<br />
much..." she informed Cain. "After all, if you say he won&#039;t hurt me and<br />
he doesn&#039;t seem to wanna hurt me then it should be ok... right?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Trust me," said Cain, "he doesn&#039;t want to hurt you.  He&#039;s a war<br />
horse born and bred; he has a very good idea of friend and foe."</p>
<p>By the time they&#039;d rejoined Jebodiah, the old man was beginning to get<br />
people organised.  His son Jake, who by the looks of things was<br />
nursing a hangover at least as bad as Ilandra&#039;s, would be in charge of<br />
Wheat Down in his father&#039;s absence.  Aside from the two nobles and<br />
the elder, two more fae would be going to Castle Hyacinth.  One of<br />
them, whom Ilandra recognised as having been talking to Jebodiah when<br />
she awoke, was a tough and rugged-looking old man with a bandanna and a<br />
multitude of scars.  The other, almost his polar opposite in<br />
appearance, was a young man wearing a brightly-coloured cape who looked<br />
for all the world like his introduction would include the phrase "Great<br />
Adventurer".</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra sidled up to Jake and pressed a hop into his hand. "It&#039;ll help<br />
the hangover..." she whispered. Just as soon as he acknowledged her she<br />
reappeared next to Cain, putting a hop in her mouth to help her own<br />
hangover as well.</p>
<p>"So, what now?" she asked of Jebodiah.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, now we get ki&#039;ed up!" said Jebodiah.  "We&#039;s got five people<br />
an&#039; only one &#039;orse, so &#039;e&#039;d be bes&#039; used carryin&#039; what kit we<br />
&#039;ave.  E&#039;ryone in t&#039;village knew th&#039; day were comin&#039; soon, so we<br />
ain&#039;t got no g&#039;byes ta say.  Once yer horse i&#039; packed, we&#039;re<br />
roight ready ta&#039; go!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Cracking her knuckles, Ilandra set herself to the task of helping load<br />
up the horse. Making sure Cain didn&#039;t have to do very much work.<br />
(Mostly by doing a flying tackle everytime anything was handed to him<br />
and thus intercepting the load.)<br />
Once the horse was loaded, she looked around in anticipation.</p>

<p>"Roight," announced Jebodiah when everything was packed to his satisfaction.  "If we&#039;s all ready, then let&#039;s go!"</p>
<p>Hawthorn sported a particularly grim expression as he started to walk<br />
alongside them, only barely allowing Cain to lead him with his reins to<br />
keep up the pretence that the horse didn&#039;t know exactly what he was<br />
doing.  He verily radiated displeasure at being loaded up with<br />
their supplies rather than being ridden, but the effect seemed<br />
completely lost on the peasants.</p>
<p>It seemed that the bandanna-endowed man was a scout of some sort, for<br />
almost as soon as they&#039;d left Wheat Down he hurried on ahead and was<br />
not seen again for some time.  Jebodiah and the young man walked<br />
at the front of the group, it being painfully obvious from their<br />
silence that they had nothing whatsoever in common to talk about.<br />
Ilandra and Cain, leading his horse, followed a few paces behind.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra trailed behind Cain for a couple of minutes noticing the<br />
displeasure that the horse was radiating. Getting slightly more scared<br />
and worried she tugged on Cain&#039;s sleeve.</p>
<p>"Erm... the death machine is being scary... could I have a sugar cube or something to give to him..."</p>
<p>He handed her a sugar cube and Ilandra made a mental note to figure out<br />
where the hell he was getting them from as she approached Hawthorn<br />
carefully.</p>
<p>"Here you go Mr. Hawthorn... please don&#039;t stampede us..." she handed<br />
him the sugar cube with her hand flat as she&#039;d seen Cain do.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Hawthorn stooped down until his nose was a bare inch from Ilandra&#039;s<br />
outstretched palm, and sniffed.  Seemingly happy, he licked up the<br />
sugar cube with his tongue and pushed his muzzle into the girl&#039;s palm.</p>
<p>As soon as he did, Ilandra heard the horse&#039;s rough voice clear as day inside her head.</p>
<p>"Do not be concerned, your Grace.  You are not in any danger from<br />
me.  And the ire I feel is a mere fraction of what I would endure<br />
for my House."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"You&#039;re really quite sweet aren&#039;t you?" she asked, fighting against the<br />
urge to declare &#039;omg a talking horse" and freak out. Stroking his neck<br />
idly, she moderated her step to fall in with the horse&#039;s. "It shouldn&#039;t<br />
be too long now... and when we&#039;re done with all this gallivanting I&#039;ll<br />
fill the stables in my house up with friends for you... though I won&#039;t<br />
ride them" as she finished the sentence she visibly shuddered in fear.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Our kind exist to be ridden, your Grace," said Hawthorn.  From<br />
the abundant lack of anyone&#039;s reaction, it was clear that Ilandra was<br />
the only one who could hear him.  "Our purpose is to carry our<br />
master into battle.  To act as a... a <i>mule</i><br />
as I currently do is part of my duty to the Prince.  But to own<br />
one such as myself without any intention to ride him would be...<br />
confusing."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I dunno, I mean, out of all the horses you&#039;re the only one I&#039;ve met<br />
that doesn&#039;t scare me..." she pondered for a second. "Do you reckon you<br />
could come along and choose one that&#039;s not too scary for me? Mind you,<br />
asking you to choose a horse might be weird for you... Would you?"<br />
She looked at the horse imploringly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I would not consider it &#039;weird&#039;, your Grace.  In the same way<br />
that you appraise others of your kind as lovers or as soldiers, we too<br />
appraise our kind.  However, I belong to my master.  I may<br />
only assist you if he permits it."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra nodded. "I should probably go ask him. It was an absolute<br />
pleasure talking to you..." she gave the horse a last pat and rejoined<br />
Cain.</p>
<p>"Cain... do you reckon I could one day get a horse like yours? Also, my feet are getting tired can I have a hug?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Of course you can," said Cain, lifting Ilandra up to his height and<br />
hugging her tightly.  "Er, if you want one, that is.  I<br />
thought you didn&#039;t like horses?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I don&#039;t, but Mr Hawthorn would get really lonely in the stables alone<br />
and he said if you let him he&#039;ll help me pick a really nice horse and<br />
seeing as he&#039;s not that scary anymore maybe it&#039;ll be a lovely horse and<br />
they can be friends and we can go out on rides to say hello to everyone<br />
and stuff..." Ilandra trailed off as she snuggled into Cain&#039;s shoulder.<br />
"You can put me down if you like... my feet weren&#039;t that painful... or<br />
painful at all..." she smiled impishly. "I just wanted a hug..." He put<br />
her down and, blushing she grabbed his hand.</p>
<p>"How far do you reckon we have left?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"How far?" asked Cain.  "Well, I&#039;ve not been this way before, but,<br />
ah... Jebodiah said it was a good day&#039;s travel to the castle, so I<br />
would think at least we&#039;d make it by sunset tomorrow."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Oh." she said, then added more to herself "Well, what could we do to pass the time?"</p>
<p>She looked around, thinking.</p>
<p>"Cain... what&#039;s Duke Hyacinth actually like? Is he nice?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Duke Hyacinth?  Well, he&#039;s... lacking in a few qualities that a<br />
Duke should generally have," said Cain.  "I&#039;ve rarely met him, he<br />
never attended many of the balls and parties that my family and I<br />
did.  From what I gather he&#039;s not one for that sort of thing at<br />
all - quite shy in fact.  But, as you can probably tell from the<br />
fact that this whole revolution-in-the-making is going on, he&#039;s not<br />
much of a good ruler.  He&#039;s cowardly enough to switch sides in the<br />
war, three times now, trying to save his own life with little regard of<br />
the effect that has on his kingdom."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"But doesn&#039;t he have an adviser? Even I have one of those... and I only<br />
have two staff" Ilandra said. "Why didn&#039;t he just give the throne up to<br />
someone more capable if he wanted to save his own life?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I think it&#039;s a twisted kind of pride, really.  Perhaps despite<br />
the cowardice, he&#039;s so falsely confident in his own ability that he<br />
refuses to let anyone do his job instead of him."</p>
<p>Cain thought for a while.  "Or perhaps there really isn&#039;t anyone<br />
else.  I don&#039;t know if he has cousins or other family members, but<br />
it&#039;s said he has no wife and no heirs."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Maybe they all got killed and he&#039;s trying his best..." she said,<br />
looking fixedly at the ground. "and so he doesn&#039;t know he&#039;s letting<br />
everyone down cos he was never taught how to run a kingdom..." She<br />
looked up at Cain "Cos it&#039;s kinda scary and looks really hard to do..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I think, what with the war on, it might be too late to re-educate the<br />
man," said Cain.  "Besides, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll find it all that<br />
hard yourself.  You&#039;ll have plenty of people you can ask for<br />
advice, and... you can always look to Duke Hyacinth&#039;s example of how<br />
not to do it."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"My mother always used to say it was never too late to learn something<br />
new... kinda makes me wonder whether she learnt her lesson at the end<br />
or not" Ilandra said pensively. "Perhaps the Duke will appreciate the<br />
heads-up and apologise to his subjects... though I don&#039;t know how far<br />
the apology will go... I mean, if they&#039;re doing a revolt then they&#039;ve<br />
obviously had enough and don&#039;t wanna forgive..." She squeezed his hand.<br />
"Though I reckon I have an advantage really... cos didn&#039;t you get<br />
taught about how to run a kingdom?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, of course I did.  I&#039;m guessing Duke Hyacinth was educated<br />
the same sort of way, but...  Maybe the power went to his<br />
head.  History&#039;s full of examples of rulers who turned bad as soon<br />
as they started using their power - I&#039;m sure Abel could tell you about<br />
plenty of them."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;d hate to get corrupted by power..." she said grimly. "Do you reckon<br />
the Duke&#039;ll have a cup of tea for us when we get there? Cos tea would<br />
be nice..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Depends whether he sees us coming or not.  If not, then I&#039;d<br />
assume not.  If he does, then..."  Cain looked at the rest of<br />
the group - heavily laden warhorse, old man with shining eyes and<br />
revolutionary zeal, young man with far too much weaponry hanging from<br />
him...  And, in the distance, the fifth member of their group, who<br />
appeared to have just beaten a wild bear into submission and was<br />
dragging it behind him, possibly as an example to the rest.</p>
<p>"If he does...  Probably also no."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra&#039;s eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p>"But... it&#039;s basic etiquette!" she said, her voice gaining volume. "I<br />
don&#039;t know about you, but I haven&#039;t been able to get my hands on any<br />
tea for so long that I&#039;d appreciate a cup... even if I have to beat the<br />
manners into him!" She finished that sentence smacking a fist into her<br />
other hand. Noticing the extra pairs of eyes on her she blushed<br />
slightly. "That is to say, I&#039;ll sit him down and educate him on how one<br />
should treat one&#039;s guests..." She looked decidedly guilty as she<br />
trailed off.<br />
"I like tea... or at least I remember tea tasting good... or was that<br />
the biscuit aspect of it?" she said quietly as she grabbed Cain&#039;s hand<br />
again. "The tea supply dried up when you left... and it felt kinda<br />
sacrilegious to get some more..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m sure there must have been some left in the stores, or, you know,<br />
you could have asked some peasants.  But still, never mind.<br />
I&#039;m sure even if Duke Hyacinth doesn&#039;t offer us any, there&#039;ll still be<br />
time for tea somewhere around the place.  If nothing else, we<br />
could always requisition it!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"but that would have been their tea... that said, I bet you&#039;re really<br />
gorgeous when you requisition stuff..." she trailed off, her mind<br />
clearly on other things. "Do you reckon we&#039;d get away with running off<br />
with Duke Hyacinths tea stores? Oooh or you could requisition it from<br />
him..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m not sure one can requisition something of a Duke unless you&#039;re the<br />
King or Queen," said Cain.  "It&#039;s more something you do of<br />
peasants or lesser nobility.  But depending on how things go when<br />
we get there - who knows if there&#039;ll even be a Duke Hyacinth.  Or<br />
for that matter, who knows if there is even one now?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I think you&#039;d know if there was no Duke... when my parents died all<br />
the flowers wilted and it took several weeks to restore them. It<br />
happened the same when Lysander died... even though he was Crown<br />
Prince... though the flowers went haywire when I took the job..." she<br />
said. "Anyway, if he&#039;s as bad a ruler as he seems then he&#039;s less of a<br />
Duke than I am and therefore I&#039;m better than him, surely that means I<br />
can requisition stuff. How long do you reckon it&#039;ll take to get to the<br />
council after we finish with the Duke?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain thought for a minute or so.</p>
<p>"A good point, but thinking about it...  Have you seen any<br />
Hyacinths since we came here?  This land&#039;s so torn up through war<br />
and in-fighting and misrule that we might not even be able to tell if<br />
there&#039;s anyone still ruling at all!  At least until we get to the<br />
castle I suppose.  Things will get a little more obvious then.</p>
<p>To the council... no idea.  It&#039;s a long way, through many<br />
kingdoms.  I&#039;m not sure how exactly, but I was hoping that some<br />
kind of quicker way than riding would present itself..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"That seems like an interesting game to play... If you find a hyacinth<br />
then you win 100 points and when you get to each 200 points you<br />
get...you get a kiss!" She smiled. "Worst case scenario you&#039;ll just<br />
have to put up with the consolation prize which is many kisses... How&#039;s<br />
that sound?"</p>
<p>Without waiting for an answer, Ilandra started paying attention to the scenery...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Within an hour or so, the question was answered,  Despite it<br />
being, at the end of April, almost past flowering season for Hyacinths,<br />
Ilandra and Cain had between them spotted several.  Reasonable<br />
proof, it would seem, that there was at the very least a Duke or<br />
Duchess Hyacinth still alive and ruling - however badly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>A thought crossed Ilandra&#039;s mind.</p>
<p>"Cain, now that I think about it... it seems a bit daft that we doubted<br />
there was a Duke cos do you remember the weird thing that hit us when<br />
we entered these lands? Well, if that&#039;s dependent on the Duke it<br />
wouldn&#039;t have been there and I&#039;d have been just fine. What do you<br />
think?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Oh, the disorientating thing?  Yes, I suppose if it was meant to<br />
protect the kingdom, then maybe so...  But it wasn&#039;t very<br />
effective, was it?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, it might be to make soldiers fall over... cos soldiers, let&#039;s<br />
face it they have pointy bits so if they fall on each other there&#039;s a<br />
high chance they&#039;ll probably stab each other and thus manage to kill<br />
each other making it a little bit less hassle for whatever army the<br />
duke has... if indeed he has one and isn&#039;t relying on the forcefield."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, maybe so," said Cain.  "But if so, then I suppose they<br />
erected it too late - after all, as I understand it the main force of<br />
the Red army is already on Hyacinth land and we&#039;ve not heard of them<br />
all accidentally stabbing each other."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Oh, but if they&#039;d accidentally stabbed each other, well, how would<br />
they let anybody know? They&#039;d be dead! In my experience dead things<br />
don&#039;t tend to be very talkative. Though you must admit, it would be<br />
slightly amusing..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I... suppose," said Cain, not in truth liking the idea of losing most<br />
of his allies&#039; army.  "But still, there&#039;d be officers,<br />
standard-bearers, musicians - word would&#039;ve got back to us."</p>
<p>He thought for a while.  "Um, unless the Whites came and picked<br />
off the rest, I suppose.  But they couldn&#039;t possibly hide so many<br />
bodies..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Noticing the expression of distaste on Cain&#039;s face Ilandra attempted to backtrack.</p>
<p>"Not that I want either side to come to any harm, just the mental image<br />
was funny... though the fact people get hurt makes it unfunny... oh<br />
dear..." she trailed off. "I don&#039;t think the whites killed off all the<br />
soldiers... gods know our hospital is already heaving with casualties<br />
and I didn&#039;t know that thing was there so maybe the officers didn&#039;t<br />
notice it... and maybe the standard bearers weren&#039;t with the armies and<br />
stuff... I didn&#039;t know musicians went to war."</p>
<p>Her mind was racing on ways to stop the nonsense pouring out, but now<br />
that she was nervous there was little chance of it stopping before she<br />
put her foot in it.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Of course they- oh, I suppose you&#039;ve never seen a battle, have you?"<br />
asked Cain.  "I, er, suppose that&#039;s probably for the best<br />
really.  You don&#039;t want to.  I know I would rather not have<br />
done..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I suppose. If you don&#039;t want the memories let me know when we get back<br />
home..." she said, sadly. "Not having seen battle is all well and good<br />
but I saw plenty of the effects of battle, and I have memories of it...<br />
my imagination put in the rest..." she visibly shuddered.<br />
"I don&#039;t want you to go back into battle ever again."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, with any luck, we won&#039;t have to," said Cain, for now ignoring<br />
the comment about his memories.  "Now they&#039;re back on the<br />
offensive, I just hope the Reds can win the war and get it all over<br />
with..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"What would it take for the Reds to win, do you think?" she asked. "I<br />
mean, do they need more people on one side than another or?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Who knows, really?" said Cain.  "They say things are pretty<br />
evenly matched, hence all the back-and-forth squabbling.  I<br />
guess... it would take something pretty big to make us sure we were<br />
going to win."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Does it really matter who wins? I mean, not having sided with anyone<br />
it doesn&#039;t really make much of a difference to me. But if you want your<br />
side to win, then that&#039;s what I want too... though I don&#039;t really want<br />
to get involved..." she fidgeted with a loose thread on her dress. "Not<br />
that I could get involved anyway. But would it matter either way?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I guess it doesn&#039;t matter, all things considered," said Cain. "Truth<br />
be told, we&#039;re only on the Reds&#039; side because of our historical<br />
allegiances. I&#039;d rather the war were over, but apart from whatever the<br />
Black Roses are planning, most of the Dukes and Duchesses have a vested<br />
interest in keeping it going..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Why would anyone want to keep fighting unless they absolutely have<br />
to?" she asked, "It just seems like such a wasteful thing to do..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"We sort of do have to.  If both sides would agree to stop<br />
together, then that would be perfect.  But they won&#039;t, because<br />
neither side trusts the other not to attack them as soon as they begin<br />
to withdraw."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well that sucks." she said, pouting. "Is there nothing happier to talk about?" She kicked a stone on the path aimlessly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p><font color="red">Hihi, roll Perception + Alertness, difficulty 8 plzkthx.</font></p>
<p>Cain rolls Perception (3) + Alertness (0), difficulty 8.  0 successes.</p>

smile was clearly not convincing anyone... the man deflated and they<br />
carried on walking.</p>
