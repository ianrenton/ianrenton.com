<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Ilandra, alone in recognising the raccoon hanging above them, carried<br />
on walking with the rest of the group.  Jebodiah and the<br />
heroic-looking young man passed underneath with barely a glance up, and<br />
Nyano did little to refute their opinion that he was just a wild animal.</p>
<p>Until, that is, Cain and Ilandra passed underneath...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>With a despairing wail of "CAAAAAIIIIINE!" Nyano dives out of his branch to land in front of the ambling prince.</p>
<p>He collapses in a heap and starts sobbing.</p>
<p>"I think I killed someone!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Glaring at Cain, then at Nyano for a few seconds then back at Cain.</p>
<p>Biting down her temper she asked.</p>
<p>"How do you mean you think you killed someone? You either did or you didn&#039;t." she seemed perplexed.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looks over at the scary catgirl and cries harder.</p>
<p>"I guess I did, it was all so quick."</p>
<p>He shuffles up closer to Caine.</p>
<p>"I came through the border and my head hurt, so I got the guards to come nearby to show them that there was barrier thing"</p>
<p>Nyano is talking really quickly, as if he wants to get this off his chest.</p>
<p>"and then I went through it again, and I passed out. When I came to,<br />
one of the soliders had tried to come through the barrier, and he was<br />
bleeding through his ears."</p>
<p>The Raccoon pauses for a moment to sob into his arm.</p>
<p>"We buried him an hour later."</p>
<p>Then he pretty much gives up on the concept of intelligle speech and just hugs Caine&#039;s leg and sobs.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Carefully peeling the crying raccoon from Cain&#039;s leg, she hugs him,<br />
stroking his head for a few moments, whispering soothing words.</p>
<p>"It&#039;ll be ok, you&#039;ll see... Tell you what, I&#039;ll tell Duke Hyacinth off<br />
for the nasty barrier and make him apologise to you for all the pain<br />
he&#039;s caused you." she said, soothingly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>After a little care the distraught raccoon quietens down and hugs the suddenly not scary cat girl that was being nice to him.</p>
<p>"I think his name was Jenkins."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"OK, well when we get to the castle we&#039;ll give the good-for-nothing<br />
meanie what for..." she said reassuringly. "And then he&#039;ll probably<br />
apologise to you for it..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano wriggles about in Illandra&#039;s arms until his head is at her eye level.</p>
<p>"You think he will? Are we going there now?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Yes, but I have no idea where we are right now or when we&#039;ll be<br />
getting there... Cain knows... and so does Jebodiah... but I&#039;ve never<br />
really been anywhere that isn&#039;t poppy or honeysuckle lands for a long<br />
time..." she said. "As to whether he&#039;ll apologise. Well he&#039;ll have to!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano&#039;s eyes narrow.</p>
<p>"Oh he&#039;ll apologise alright. Putting a barrier like that up without telling his neighbours is unforgivable."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra gently lowered the raccoon to the ground.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I can&#039;t carry you for too long... my arms hurt a bit." she<br />
said, careful not to mention the fact pretty much all of her hurt due<br />
to a hangover. "Are you OK to walk or would you like me to see if Mr<br />
Hawthorn is willing to carry you?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano sets his feet determinedly on the ground.</p>
<p>"I can walk, it&#039;ll be fine."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra nodded and they carried on their way to the palace.</p>
<p>"Nyano, why are you in Hyacinth lands? Did Regara send you or something?" Ilandra asked after a while.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano walks steadfastly on as he answers.</p>
<p>"There was a messenger. He said that they&#039;d seen someone who looked like my father in Castle Hyacinth."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"So," said Jebodiah, sensing the lull in conversation and turning back<br />
to the nobles.  "This... r&#039;coon?  E&#039;s a friend&#039;a yours?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"You could say that, yes." Ilandra answered. "He&#039;s more of a friend of<br />
Cain&#039;s than mine really. Nyano, this is Jebodiah. Jebodiah, this is<br />
Nyano."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Pleased to meet you!" Nyano tries to give a winning smile, but his heart just isn&#039;t in it. "So what do you do?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Right now?" Jebodiah asked.  "We&#039;re going to have a word with the<br />
Duke.  I was, and I suppose still am, an ordinary man of a village<br />
called Wheat Down.  After our little Ducal chat...  Who knows<br />
what will happen."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Oooh it&#039;s just like that story! With the girl and the dog!" Ilandra<br />
said, excitedly. "Only there&#039;s no scarecrow or metal guy..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"A girl and a dog?" says Nyano, he turns to look at Jebodiah "Do you... Do you work in a pet shop?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Now what makes you think that I would work in a pet shop?" asked Jebodiah.</p>
<p><font color="red">Did you just hear that crumbling sound?  I&#039;m sure there used to be a fourth wall over there somewhere...</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Well my father always told me never to judge by appearances."</p>
<p><font color="red">Oh please can Nyano&#039;s father be Prince Phil?</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"So it&#039;s better to assume someone works in a pet shop for no reason?"</p>
<p><font color="red">Alright then =p  Big burly man, or big burly raccoon?</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"I wasn&#039;t assuming! I&#039;ll have you know I was asking. What&#039;s wrong with working in a pet shop anyway?"</p>
<p>Nyano looks indignant.</p>
<p><font color="red">Burly Raccoon. Burly man would be disturbing.</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Er, nowt, I s&#039;pose," mumbled Jebodiah, seemingly caught off guard by<br />
his surreal exchange with the raccoon.  "Oi&#039;m a bit too old ta&#039; be<br />
workin&#039; all &#039;time, so no, Oi don&#039; work in a pet shop.</p>
<p>"Anyroad, we&#039;s all goin&#039; ta the castle.  If ye got business there, feel free ta join us tha&#039; far."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Oh I&#039;ve got business at the castle alright." Nyano says "Duke Hyacinth killed one of my men."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well&#039;n," said the old man.  "Looks loike we&#039;s got a&#039;least one thing in common."</p>
<p>With that the group set off, one small furry member larger, on the way to Castle Hyacinth.</p>
