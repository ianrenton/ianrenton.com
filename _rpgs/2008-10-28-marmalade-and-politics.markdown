<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Long past dawn, the bustling kitchens awoke once more.  The<br />
banquet hall, now cleared and re-set (by mundane means this time) for<br />
breakfast, was for some hours empty besides the vast piles of food,<br />
from bacon to jam and from toast to hog roast.</p>
<p>Gradually, in varying states of consciousness and dress, the guests arrived.</p>
<p>Abel was a particularly early riser, and for a considerable amount of time was the only one to be breakfasting at the top table.</p>
<p><font color="red">OC: Feel free to head in for breakfast at any time<br />
you like.  If you&#039;re pretty early, come in now, otherwise if you<br />
both poke me to continue I&#039;ll do a bit more breakfast-stuff before<br />
waiting for you two again.</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano was next in. Being a scoutmaster he was used to having to wake up early and hadn&#039;t had time to get out of the habit.</p>
<p>He marched in full of morning cheer waved at Abel. The hog immediately<br />
caught his eye but he decided that it was far to early for something<br />
that heavy and piled himself up a mountain of teacakes.</p>
<p>Plate of teacakes in hand went and lounged against the top table to raid Abel&#039;s supply of jams and speads.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Regara was the next to make her way slowly into the room.  Once<br />
seated at the top table, she glanced around the table.  It had<br />
been arranged in the traditional fashion - that is, in order of<br />
decreasing calorific value with increasing distance from the Duchess&#039;<br />
throne.</p>
<p>Thus, she was easily able to help herself to a slab of buttered<br />
chocolate spread, which at some point may have been built on toastlike<br />
foundations.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane had finally ran out of strength for holding hands and changing<br />
bandages by dawn, at which point the hospital staff had been obliged to<br />
lead her to a bunk because she could barely see in front of her. She&#039;d<br />
needed to borrow a uniform from the annoyingly perky Susie in order to<br />
make it to Honeysuckle Cottage to change into her own clothes, and had<br />
noted with regret that she did not fill it out quite as well.</p>
<p>She slunk into the Great Hall of Castle Poppy with her hat pulled low<br />
over her eyes in an attempt to disguise the black circles under them;<br />
on the bright side, she felt calmer, or at least calm enough to find<br />
Nyano and make plans to infiltrate Hyacinth territory. Thankfully she<br />
seemed to have had enough sleep that there was no risk of impaired<br />
reflexes to her in danger during the trip. She sat down next to Abel<br />
and started munching on crumpets, if not quite with a healthy and<br />
energetic appetite, then at least not listlessly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Morning, you two," said Abel amidst mouthfuls of the bacon bush&#039;s<br />
finest fruits.  "I&#039;m guessing it&#039;ll be a while yet before my<br />
mother&#039;s ready to start announcing her plans.  So in the<br />
meantime..."  He cast his gaze about the room.  "Eleven of<br />
us, three hundred people&#039;s worth of food!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looks up from his piled up plate.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m not sure that the duchess only counts for one person..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well," said Abel, glancing conspiratorially around the room again.  "Maybe make that fift-"</p>
<p>In his glancing, his gaze had come to rest on his mother, who was<br />
looking right back at him with the trademarked motherly &#039;I can hear<br />
you, you know&#039; glare.</p>
<p>"Erk."</p>
<p>Abel panicked for a moment before the rational part of his mind<br />
returned and he offered his mother a plate of doughnuts.  She took<br />
three, stuck her tongue out at Abel and Nyano, then returned to the<br />
gargantuan task of breakfasting.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane raised an eyebrow at Abel and Nyano. "Never, ever try to separate<br />
a lady and her chocolate," she informed them seriously as she poured<br />
herself another cup of coffee. "All the guests staggered home, I take<br />
it?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Staggered home?" asked Abel.  "Certainly not, they&#039;ve all come<br />
much too far for that.  Why, some of them have travelled for weeks<br />
to be here!  No, they&#039;re all in the castle somewhere.</p>
<p>"Now there&#039;s not so many of us," Abel said with a sigh, "there&#039;s a lot more guest rooms."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Ahh, they&#039;re sleeping off last night&#039;s indulgences then? Fair enough.<br />
I&#039;m finding myself remarkably unaffected by all the Aardvarks, although<br />
I really was off my head at the time...Abel, how are <i>you</i>?" Akane grinned mischievously.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano takes the opportunity to ask the question that was bugging him all night.</p>
<p>"How do you drink an aardvark?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane turned slightly green and responded, "It depends on...what kind<br />
of Aardvark it is. The kind of Aardvark that&#039;s an animal, I&#039;m not sure<br />
how you&#039;d drink that...and if anybody managed it, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d want<br />
to know about it... but the kind of Aardvark I was drinking was<br />
actually a kind of alcohol. The only thing it has in common with the<br />
animal kind of Aardvark is that they have the same name. Uhh...am I<br />
making any sense at all?" she groaned as she buried her face in her<br />
coffee.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Yep, it makes sense to me. So where do these alchohol aardvarks live<br />
anyway? I bet it&#039;s really hard to catch one, you couldn&#039;t use a net,<br />
it&#039;d just slip through. That must mean that it&#039;s really rare. Hugh<br />
serves the coolest things at our parties!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Umm," Akane responded, racking her brain for an answer. "Alcohol<br />
Aardvarks mostly live in bottles, and breweries. You could say<br />
they&#039;re...domesticated. Bred to be brewed. Much like cows, they<br />
wouldn&#039;t exist without the humans."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"I didn&#039;t know that, but I guess it was obvious, where else would an alcohol aardvark live?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane shrugged. "I&#039;ve only seen &#039;em in those places, anyway. Not<br />
exactly hunted them in the wild. Come to think of it, I&#039;ve mostly<br />
avoided alcohol Aardvarks, except for a few memorable nights..." she<br />
quickly shoved down the relevant memories. "Err, have you heard back<br />
about the state of the Hyacinth lands yet?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Ah," said Regara, scattering toast crumbs unto the four winds, "I was<br />
wondering if you&#039;d be asking that.  From what I heard last night,<br />
which isn&#039;t much mind you, the situation is about how your friend in<br />
the cells described it.</p>
<p>"The Whites are maintaining a strong resistance in Hyacinth territory,<br />
what with it being so difficult for the Reds to attack properly.<br />
Mister Chicken mentioned something about Gorilla Warfare, though I&#039;m<br />
sure Nyano, you&#039;d know more about that sort of thing than me.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s also not unheard of for big groups of peasants to be taking<br />
things into their own hands, and from what I&#039;ve heard they&#039;re somewhat<br />
beyond caring about which side they&#039;re supposed to be on.  So,<br />
Akane, you might want to be somewhat reluctant to be stopped by just<br />
about anyone if you&#039;re going in there."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Yes, Nyano did warn me, Your Grace," Akane responded. "I&#039;m very much<br />
hoping they won&#039;t waylay a perfectly innocuous fox; I should <i>get</i><br />
to the village in question just fine; what I&#039;m worried about is getting<br />
out, as a fox may be fairly innocuous, but one leading a family around<br />
is probably less so. That&#039;s why I&#039;m worried that I may emerge with<br />
pursuit and hence my request for a border guard.</p>
<p>"I suppose the best plan would be to make sure I contact the family<br />
after dark and sneak out with them, as a fox going through a Fae<br />
settlement in broad daylight and with an obvious target that isn&#039;t the<br />
chicken-coop might be slightly suspicious..." she concluded.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"You&#039;re right," said Abel, "but it might not be so simple as all<br />
that.  Hyacinth kingdom is quite big, and whilst we do share a<br />
border, there&#039;s no guarantee that Albert&#039;s family are anywhere near<br />
there.  You might end up out there for several days, hiding out<br />
from whoever notices the family have gone."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane sighed. "Beyond any personal honour at stake due to the fact that<br />
I gave my word, from the way Duchess Regara explained matters, the most<br />
politically expedient (and possibly the only politically viable) course<br />
of action is for me to go. We can&#039;t leave his family there, as they&#039;d<br />
be a liability, therefore <i>someone</i>&#039;s got to fetch them, and it looks like that falls to me whether we like it or not."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I wasn&#039;t arguing that you shouldn&#039;t go, Akane.  I was just saying<br />
that you should be-"  Abel stopped mid-sentence.  "I&#039;m<br />
sorry.  I know you can look after yourself.  I, er...<br />
Yes, sorry."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"That I should be careful?" Akane smiled. "Your concern is appreciated,<br />
and I won&#039;t take it amiss, I know you&#039;re not implying I don&#039;t know what<br />
I&#039;m doing. As you said, though, I can look after myself; and yes, I<br />
will be careful. I&#039;m hoping that combined with caution, it&#039;ll be<br />
enough. If all else fails, the hospital is next door," she winked at<br />
him.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Duchess Regara stood, and banged a ladle against a nearby mountainous<br />
kettle.  She had the attention of the room - all dozen of them.</p>
<p>"My Lords, Ladies and early birds," the Duchess began.  She was<br />
greeted with vague hung over murmurs from the nobles, and with<br />
high-pitched tweeting from the early birds, who had been at the coffee<br />
already.  "Firstly, I must apologise for the somewhat unexpected<br />
turns of events last night, and I hope that you will also convey my<br />
apologies to those who are not present at breakfast.</p>
<p>"Concerning the Black Rose Committee, I am informed that over the last<br />
few years they have made themselves known to a significant proportion<br />
of Arcadia, and thus it was perhaps to be expected that they should<br />
send an emissary here.  Be assured that, though I have spoken to<br />
Lady Elaine at length, I am not presently disposed to aid their cause.</p>
<p>"Concerning the suspected poisoning, I assure you that there is and<br />
never was any danger to any of us.  There was of course no chance<br />
of an actual poison being applied to the food, and the whole incidence<br />
was in the manner of a jest.  Thus, I apologise on behalf of the<br />
perpetrators for the somewhat poor taste in which the joke was<br />
made.  However, this incident has enlightened us to a state of<br />
affairs with which we are concerned in the Duchy of Hyacinth.  At<br />
present it affects only us, and we are dispatching some of our scouts<br />
and allies to ascertain the situation.  Should it prove of<br />
importance to us all, I will of course inform you.</p>
<p>"Thank you, and please continue to enjoy your breakfast."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Just then, one of the side doors to the room burst open, and a<br />
lightning-fast blur of maid bustled in and rushed to the top table.</p>
<p>"Ah-Mister-Nyano-good-to-see-you-how-are-we-this-morning?" she<br />
asked.<br />
"One-of-the-other-servants-mentioned-something-about-a-"  She<br />
paused for a breath.  "-bill?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looked up from his breakfast, his face sporting a new and not entirely unbecoming cream moustache.</p>
<p>"A bill? I don&#039;t remember talking to any platypuses last night..."</p>
<p>Then a memory bubbles to the surface of  the ocean of icecream and determination that serves Nyano as a brain.</p>
<p>"Wait, I remember getting one from Gustaffsen. Oh that&#039;s right, I needed to talk to you about it."</p>
<p>He fishes around in his sash and manages to retrieve the crumpled bit of paper. He waves it out towards the maid as he talks.</p>
<p>"He wants the dream of one genius. I&#039;m going to need you to requisition his dream stealing apparatus in order to pay him."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Dream-of-a-genius,-right." blurred the maid.  She paused for a<br />
fraction of a second, which for her was somewhat noticeable.<br />
"Do-you-think-taking-one-of-his-own-is-cheating?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Do you know any other geniuses we could get one from?" Nyano absent-mindedly licks the cream from his face.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s not like he told us to get a specific genius&#039;s dream." He smiles,<br />
"Besides I think the price is a little steep for the little research<br />
that he did. It&#039;ll serve him right."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Right-you-are-Sir," said the maid, relativistically.  "I&#039;ll-get-right-on-it!"</p>
<p>So saying, she left the room.  It was gone a minute by the time the dust had finished settling.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>The conversation being over Nyano returned to his special place,<br />
resplendent amongst the massive amount of clotted cream and scones<br />
needed to feed a growing raccoon.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>A few minutes later the doors to the hall burst open, the echo<br />
resounding through the room long after the doors had left their hinges<br />
and collapsed to the floor.  In though the new airy opening walked<br />
a huge pile of books and vegetable-themed apparatus, which only when it<br />
approached the top table resolved itself to be the maid from earlier <i>carrying</i> all that stuff.</p>
<p>She dumped the equipment on the table in front of Nyano, causing<br />
miniature landslides of jam and marmalade.  The table buckled<br />
slightly but held, so the maid dropped the books on it as well and sent<br />
the whole thing crashing to the floor in splinters.</p>
<p>"There you are," she said, the red glow fading from her eyes.  "One... dream stealing machine."</p>
<p>The glow finally having dissipated, the maid began puffing and wheezing<br />
as if the strain of her effort had only just caught up with her.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano leaped across the splintered mess in an attempt to catch the poor maid as her muscles gave in.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for him he hadn&#039;t considered the fact that she weighted<br />
about twice what he did, and so found himself pressed to the floor<br />
under a heap of exhausted maid.</p>
<p>"Thank you" He managed to squeek to her, before the breath was fully expelled from his lungs.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The maid blinked, twice, and her eyes began to glow mysteriously yellow.</p>
<p>She almost levitated off Nyano, propelling herself up into the air, then swiftly into an apologetic curtsey.</p>
<p>"Ohmigod-I&#039;m-so-sorry-Mister-Nyano!  Are-you-okay-are-you-okay?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano pulls himself to his feet and smiles up at the young woman.</p>
<p>"No harm done."<br />
He looks over to the ruins of the head table.<br />
"Well no harm done to ME anyway..." He beckons over to a couple of his<br />
men who were surreptitiously providing security and they come over and<br />
take the mess of machinery vegetables and paperwork away to a storage<br />
room.</p>
<p>He looks back at the maid, "You couldn&#039;t get some servants to bring us<br />
a new table could you? I hadn&#039;t had a chance to try the special rainbow<br />
flavoured jam yet, and it&#039;s not a proper breakfast without rainbow<br />
flavoured jam."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Certainly-sir-of-course!" stammered the tachyonic maid.  "I&#039;ll-be-right-back-and-I&#039;ll-bring-more-rainbow-jam-too!"</p>
<p>And, in a flash, she was gone.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"could you get them to bring more of everything else as well please? I<br />
don&#039;t think the Duchess want&#039;s to be eating off the floor"</p>
<p>Nyano calls after her.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Hearing Nyano&#039;s words, Regara looked up guiltily with a slice of toast mid-way from her plate on the floor to her mouth.</p>
<p>"I... don&#039;t?" she asked, her mouth still full from the previous<br />
bite.  "I don&#039;t see why I should have to pause breakfast just<br />
because the table has become a splintered mass of jam-stained<br />
furniture, you know!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looks around at the Duchesses pronouncement, then he looks at the<br />
interesting mess on the floor. His ears perk up as he has a thought.</p>
<p>"Does that mean... Is it ok to... we&#039;re having a... FLOOR PARTY???"</p>
<p>Nyano looks at the duchess on her knees with the toast still in her hands.</p>
<p>"We are arn&#039;t we? YAAAAY!"</p>
<p>and taking advantage of his tiny frame he dives into the sticky wooden mess and starts eating.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"A... floor party?" groaned Abel, who had seen his end of the table<br />
catapult its contents halfway across the hall as the other end hit the<br />
ground.  "What&#039;s a-  Oh."</p>
<p>Watching Nyano drop to the floor and start snuffling up the food that<br />
had found its way there, Abel sighed.  It was going to be <i>another</i> one of those days...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Some little while later, once the breakfast of dubious hygiene had<br />
properly gotten underway, in walked a lady none were honestly expecting<br />
to see.  Lady Saledenre had disappeared on another of her<br />
wanderings nearly three years ago - shortly after the declaration of<br />
war, but many months before Poppy lands looked like they might be<br />
threatened.</p>
<p>Of course she had been informed by a fairly round-about route that the<br />
remainder of House Poppy were returning home, and so here she was -<br />
fashionably late for the party.</p>
<p>Though that said, looking around the room, it occurred to her that so<br />
long spent in the Human world might have thrown off her sense of time<br />
somewhat.  The damaged furniture, piles of greasy breakfast food<br />
and small huddles of hung-over nobility suggested that she might be<br />
less of an <i>hour</i> late and more of a <i>day</i>...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Oh nuts!" she exclaimed, dropping her shoulders in a huff while her<br />
lips twisted into something that was half-pout, half tight-lipped<br />
displeasure.  The lurid swathe of silk, layers upon layers of it,<br />
rustled from the motion.  "And I had some excellent stories to<br />
tell you."</p>
<p>Still obviously sulking from missing the party, and the opportunity to<br />
show off, Saledenre glided forward towards the Duchess, the movement of<br />
her feet lost in a sea of rustling silk.  She curtsied deeply, the<br />
epitome of decorum.  "Your Highness."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Duchess Regara looked up from her bowl and caught Saledenre&#039;s<br />
gaze.  She nodded, as formally as she could manage with a<br />
porridge-dripping spoon halfway to her mouth.</p>
<p>"Ah," she said, swallowing her previous mouthful.  "Salendre,<br />
yes?  My word, but it has been a long time.  How have you<br />
been?  And, for that matter, <i>where</i> have you been?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"I have been... finding inspiration, your Highness," Saledenre replied<br />
with a wide grin, her teeth a glaring white gash across her otherwise<br />
dark face.  "I lot has changed since I last walked these lands,<br />
much strife has touched it."  Eloquence, it seemed as she spoke,<br />
was second nature to the storyteller</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m afraid much strife is still touching it," Regara sighed.<br />
"Our lands are safe again for the time being, but the war is still not<br />
far away.  Have you returned with stories to tell, or do you still<br />
seek inspiration?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano pops up out of a pile of woodchips and strawberries.</p>
<p>"Can it be stories? I haven&#039;t heard a good story in ages! Tell us a story about where you&#039;ve been."</p>
<p>He pauses to think for a second.</p>
<p>"or maybe a story about alcohol aardvarks, I&#039;m not fussy."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Saledenre grinned toothily.  "Oh there will be stories a plenty to<br />
regale you with, but as the Duchess has stated, there is a time and a<br />
place for the bardic arts.  In the meantime, would someone care to<br />
explain what whirlwind of destruction crashed through this place.<br />
I am somewhat chagrinned to admit that I have been somewhat...hmmm,"<br />
the storyteller frowned, trying to remember something, "now what was it<br />
those students said.  Ah yes, &#039;out of the loop&#039;."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"This isn&#039;t a destruction, it&#039;s a breakfast!" Nyano has by now ensconced himself back amidst his beloved scones.</p>
<p>"The serving staff decided to surprise us by making today&#039;s breakfast a floor party. You should join in!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"And the splinters?" Saledenre asked, furiously trying not to laugh at<br />
the scene she beheld.  Perhaps she had been away in the land of<br />
Mortalia for far too long, she was certain that once upon a time the<br />
idea of a floor breakfast would not have seemed so odd.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"That was part of the surprise you see, they didn&#039;t tell us it was going to be a floor party until they exploded the table..."</p>
<p>Nyano glances conspiratorially at Abel&#039;s pristine morning suit, before looking back to Salendere.</p>
<p>"If you want to actually eat any of this you&#039;d better tuck in quickly,<br />
I&#039;ve got a feeling that the food fight is scheduled to start soon."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Yes, she had been gone too long, Saledenre decided and though she did<br />
not join in the feast, the bard did sink to the ground in a single,<br />
fluid motion.  She arranged her skirts around her, completely<br />
hiding her crossed legs, and looked around those who were assembled<br />
there.  Some she knew, Salendenre smiled toothily at Abel, but<br />
others were strangers to her and still more were ominously missing.</p>
<p>"Where is Ilandra?" she asked at last, noticing that the exhuberant Pooka was nowhere to be found.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel smiled back at the new arrival.  "Good morning, Saledenre,"<br />
he said, rising from his chair and coming to join her and Nyano.<br />
To the latter, as they passed, he whispered.  "I saw that<br />
look.  I&#039;m taking this suit off as soon as you even so much look<br />
at the mustard tureen!"</p>
<p>"But Ilandra," he said, returning to full volume and addressing<br />
Saledenre again.  "Ah, I take it from that that you missed last<br />
night&#039;s... interesting turn of events?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>At once Saledenre&#039;s face contorted into an expression of disgust as she<br />
remembered her long overdue return to Arcadia the previous<br />
evening.  "I got caught up in a deluge on the edge of Poppy<br />
lands," she replied, grumpily.  "Isidal was most<br />
unimpressed."  She remembered the large faery cat yowlinng<br />
unhappily as her white fir became soaked and heavy with water.<br />
She herself had not faired much better; the colourful silks she had<br />
chosen to wear especially for the return to her home world were<br />
currently dripping water over the floor of her room.</p>
<p>"But tell me, what mischief has my little Pooka friend got herself into<br />
now," Saledenre tipped her head to one side, an eyebrow raised in<br />
humoured interest and lips twitching with laughter as she wondered just<br />
what Ilandra had been up to in her absense.</p>
<hr />

<p>"Well, now there&#039;s a thing," said Abel.  "I would say &#039;in your<br />
absence&#039;, but, in truth, it&#039;s more of a &#039;since sunset&#039;, Ilandra<br />
has..."  He took a deep breath.  "Revealed that she has spent<br />
the last two years hiding out here, welcomed us home in her usual<br />
fashion, led my brother and I on a trip to the human world for<br />
ice-cream, run away from the castle, become a Duchess, been hauled<br />
back, virtually had her marriage arranged for her, and...  Oh yes,<br />
she eloped.  One could say it&#039;s been quite the day."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Saledenre&#039;s eyebrows rose.  "Man, if I could come up with a story<br />
like that I&#039;d be famous!" she exclaimed before a more sly expression<br />
replaced her incredularity.  "She wouldn&#039;t sell the rights for<br />
that, would she?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"You have to pay people before you can tell stories about them? Is that a new rule?"</p>
<p>Nyano scratched his head, he was clearly having serious trouble with this concept.</p>
<p>"It sounds kinda unfair."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Rubbing the point where her nose met her forehead, Saledenre had the<br />
grace to almost look embarrassed.  "Your words ring true,<br />
youngling," she admitted, "but strange lands have strange customs and<br />
it is a pity that they seem to have leaked into my brain a little."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Well, we better unleak it then"</p>
<p>Nyano scrabbles around in the pile next to him.</p>
<p>"Here, have a crumpet, it&#039;s good for the brain!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Thank you," Saledenre replied slowly, taking the profered<br />
crumpet.  Just as slowly, she bit into it, feeling the butter<br />
dribbling into her mouth.  She wrinkled her nose; it had already<br />
gone cold.  Still biting into the crumpet, Saledenre&#039;s eyes<br />
scanned the faces of those assembled, coming to rest upon Abel.<br />
Her eyebrows rose and her eyes sparkled with mirth.  It had been a<br />
long time since she had last been surrounded by anyone but<br />
overcomplicating humans.</p>

<p>Just then, the door to the room burst open and in rushed a high-pitched yellow blur.</p>
<p>"Master-Nyano-I-brought-the-ouch-" said the hyperactive maid, abruptly<br />
ceasing her motion as she tripped on an exposed edge of the broken top<br />
table.  The jar of jam flew from her hands, twisting in the air<br />
and upending itself in its entirety over Regara, whose red dress turned<br />
immediately psychedelic.</p>
<p>She stood, a towering mass of rage and cholesterol.  "Who<br />
did...  Nyano!  I bet it was you!" she shouted, and hurled<br />
some nearby marmalade in his direction.</p>
<p>And so, breakfast began proper, in the time-honoured fashion of House Poppy.</p>
