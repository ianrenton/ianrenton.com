<p>The Ubertuber&#039;s highly specialised conveyance left its subterranean<br />
mode, emerging at last into cool morning sunlight.  Folding the<br />
vehicle up and placing it in its pocket, the potato took stock of its<br />
surroundings.  It stood on the banks of a wide and slow-flowing<br />
river, into which drooped weeping willows and all manner of other<br />
waterside plants.  Tiny fish rippled and flashed below the surface<br />
as the last wisps of the morning mist slowly disappeared above.</p>
<p>The river snaked off through open fields and copses in either<br />
direction.  Besides the natural beauty, there was only a path that<br />
stuck next to the river through all its twists, turns and ox-bow lakes.</p>
<p>Oh, and a signpost.  To the West, the sign was inscribed "Castle<br />
Willow, 5 miles".  To the East, where the sun was slowly rising,<br />
"The Sun.  ??? miles".</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Quietly the super secret potato spy surveyed the land about him, &#039;it<br />
was good to be back on the trail once more&#039; with the feel of the sun,<br />
??? miles away, and a mission resting about his shoulders.  Now it<br />
was time to take on his first disguise.  Slowly Das Ubertuber<br />
walked into the surrounding undergrowth and did not re-emerge...</p>
<p>... A short time later and further down stream towards Castle Willow a<br />
slightly dirty servant emerged from a small gully its apron held out in<br />
front of it filled with bulbs of wild garlic.  With care in<br />
proceeded back towards the castle where he left the track, circled<br />
around to the back of the castle and entered the servants entrance;<br />
waving at the guards in a friendly confident fashion before walking<br />
towards the kitchens.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Before long, Hugh&#039;s trek took him from open plain to forest.<br />
Still the attendant followed on behind, occasionally stopping to ask a<br />
question or whinge, both of which Hugh largely ignored.</p>
<p>An hour passed, with the woods getting progressively thicker and then<br />
thinner again.  When at last he thought he saw the end of them,<br />
though...  Something else caught his finely-trained nose.<br />
Wild garlic - yet not only garlic, but hidden underneath the pungent<br />
aroma was another.  The smell of potato, but more than that!<br />
Potato the like of which Hugh had never smelt before.  A pure<br />
symphony of deliciousness, contained within the scent of but one<br />
vegetable!</p>
<p>Ahead of him, leaves rustled at the edge of the forest and a faerie man<br />
emerged, bearing a basket of garlic, but yet no noticeable<br />
potatoes.  Nor, as Hugh stepped slowly through what remained of<br />
the woods and emerged onto a well-worn path, were there any potatoes to<br />
be seen.</p>
<p>It was him!  The man smelt of that divine potato scent!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"At last. What ho there!"</p>
<p>Hugh treated the potato-y man to a gigantic smile (the attendant nodded<br />
and went back to glaring sulkily at Hugh) and offered a hand.</p>
<p>"Listen, I don&#039;t mean to be a bother, but I&#039;m a bit turned around... Well, look, do you have any idea where we are?"</p>
<p>And all the while his mind raced. Why? Why could this man smell so<br />
delicious? Sure, he&#039;d whiled away the odd afternoon at the castle<br />
rolling around in the potato store, but he&#039;d mostly just smelt muddy<br />
afterwards.</p>
<p>Maybe Eau d&#039;potato was the latest fashion - he inhaled deeply - No. No that definitely wasn&#039;t it.</p>
<p>Maybe ... Oh. Maybe it was this again.</p>
<p>"And whilst we&#039;re at it, was your father by any chance a potato? Because... well..."</p>
<p>He waggled his five-fingered hands at the man.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Carefully Das Ubertuber tugged his forelock in respect.  He&#8217;d<br />
crossed paths with Hugh on several occasions in the past, and on a few<br />
of those occasions it hadn&#8217;t been the pleasantest of times.<br />
Still, he thought, it&#8217;s a good thing he is on the same side as Das<br />
Creator else he&#8217;d be a real menace.  In a sluring country burr he<br />
said, &#8220;G&#8217;day Gv&#8217;ner.  Why you be a few mile from Castle<br />
Willow.  Keep on down track and you be there in no time.  As<br />
for my Fa&#8217;ter sir, he be a fairy through and through.  Though now<br />
you come to mention it I once did hear a roomer in Village that he had<br />
this odd thing for vegetables.  Spent many a lonesome night out in<br />
the fields, talking to his plants.  Why&#8217;d you ask?&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Well, that made sense enough. Hugh had heard all kinds of strange<br />
things about what went on in the sticks and there weren&#039;t a shortage of<br />
comely potatos in the world...</p>
<p>He grinned at the man.</p>
<p>"Tell me sir, have you ever considered a career in waitering? I do<br />
think you&#039;d be more than passing good at it. Castle Willow you say,<br />
well it&#039;s been a while, what do you think Mr Attendant?"</p>
<p>The attendant still seemed to be spluttering rubbish, really the man<br />
was getting quite tiresome. Hugh returned his attention to the potato<br />
fellow.</p>
<p>"Unless I miss my mark, your destination with that garlic will be the<br />
kitchen, I&#039;d consider it a singular honour if you wouldn&#039;t object to<br />
our following you there, for turning up at the front doors always<br />
involves a certain amount of tedium, but there&#039;s always something good<br />
happening in a kitchen. And I&#039;ve just had an idea for a potato and<br />
garlic soup that needs a little fleshing out...</p>
<p>Leeks are so passe, obviously an onion or two ... Cheese! Perhaps, if it was mild and ..."</p>
<p>And so muttering to himself, lost in a world of tubery speculation, Hugh ambled happily down the road.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>As Hugh seemed to have gone off on one of his long self dialogs about<br />
cooking Das Uber Tuber decided it was best to to reply and after a<br />
pause in which he looked totally dumb founded and bemused by everything<br />
he turned and started heading towards Castle Willow.  He was<br />
almost certain the talkative chef would follow him to the castle.<br />
Hopefully I&#039;ll be able to lose him at the gate or in the kitchens the<br />
starchy spy thought to himself.</p>
<p>As he reached the castle he proceeded with care. Leaving track, circled<br />
around to the back of the castle and entered the servants entrance;<br />
waving at the guards in a friendly confident fashion before walking<br />
towards the kitchens.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>And Hugh absently followed along behind, still in a gastronomic world<br />
of his own. The attendant, after eying up the guards and deciding<br />
they&#039;d have even less of an ear for his complaints than Hugh followed<br />
him in turn, still complaining in what he hoped was a forthright and<br />
strident fashion.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>The kitchen was full of people rushing here and there, steam rising<br />
from many bubbling pots and smoke from the cook fires mingling with<br />
all. Carefully the Starchy super spy wended his way through the chaos,<br />
deftly slipping between the fairies diligently preparing the days<br />
food.  Just as he passed one of the cook fires a log<br />
&#039;accidentally&#039; fell from the grate scattering smoke, ash and partially<br />
cooked food everywhere.  In the kerfuffle no one seemed to notice<br />
the newly acquired basket of garlic sitting quietly on the side, nor<br />
the domestic who was working his way down the hall broom and pan in<br />
hand, and an array of polishes and dusters at his belt...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Certainly not Hugh, who had taken a good look around and established<br />
that there was indeed something going on. And it was a bit of a<br />
shambles.</p>
<p>Slipping around the frantic staff, who seemed a little too interested<br />
in running around like headless chickens, he swept up the basket of<br />
garlic, some potatoes and a variety of other sundries.</p>
<p>And as he ambled his way around the kitchen, fetching chopping boards,<br />
knives, finding a large pot and an empty stove... He slipped in a<br />
little word here, a small soupcon of advice there.</p>
<p>Soon, he&#039;d forgotten all about the strangely potatoy man and had all<br />
but taken over the kitchen. Even the funfair assistant had found a<br />
chef&#039;s hat from somewhere and was - inexpertly but surprisingly<br />
succesfully - whip up a small batch of souffles.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Time passed, as time is wont to do, and it drew inexorably closer to<br />
lunchtime.  The Ubertuber, as a domestic servant, worked his way<br />
into the large serving staff of the castle whilst Hugh set about<br />
refining the menu of the kitchens.</p>
<p>Whilst the rota was already set for the lunchtime servants, and thus<br />
the Ubertuber did not manage to infiltrate the hall quite so easily as<br />
all that, the time soon came for both of he and Hugh.  So<br />
impressed was Duke Willow with his meal that he sent for the head chef,<br />
and the order to fetch him was passed from senior to junior amongst the<br />
staff until eventually the Ubertuber - who, since nobody recognised<br />
him, must be <i>very</i> junior indeed - was given the task.</p>
<p>Down in the kitchens Hugh had all but taken over, and had the Willow<br />
chefs following his orders.  So it was that Hugh was led away from<br />
the kitchens by a servant who - coincidences abounding - smelt just<br />
like butter melting into mashed potato.  Hugh had very little time<br />
to contemplate this, however, nor the tuber to escape Hugh&#039;s suspicion,<br />
because soon enough they stood before the high table.  Amongst a<br />
line of unfamiliar faces stood Duke Willow, loudly applauding Hugh&#039;s<br />
culinary mastery, and next to him, looking very suspiciously at them<br />
both, was none other than Elaine of the Black Rose Committee.</p>
<p>"Bravo, Bravo!" cried Duke Willow, still clapping.  "Sir," he said<br />
to Hugh loud enough that the whole room could hear, "do please tell us<br />
your name!"</p>
<p><font color="red">House Willow are, as far as you know, definitely on the Red side.  The Duke was at the Poppies&#039; homecoming party.</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Hugh waved politely to the woman he half remembered from some party<br />
recently - he was sure there was something going on with her, but he&#039;d<br />
been so distracted by all the goings on with the poison ...</p>
<p>"Call me Hugh!" he beamed up at the Duke. "And I&#039;m glad you enjoyed it.<br />
Even more so the inspiration for the soup - wasn&#039;t it marvellous? - is<br />
here too, I&#039;d never have thought of it if it hadn&#039;t been for this stout<br />
starchy fellow here.</p>
<p>Have you smelt him highness? It&#039;s a real treat!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Smelt him?  Whatever do you mean?  It sounds rather... uncouth to me.  Is it a cook&#039;s thing, perhaps?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"Uncouth?"</p>
<p>Hugh blinked.</p>
<p>"I suppose it could be. I&#039;m sure he doesn&#039;t mind though! And besides,<br />
if he didn&#039;t want people smelling him, he wouldn&#039;t smell so!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, er," said Duke Willow, quite taken aback.  "I suppose so, then..."</p>
<p>He shot a confused glance at the vegetable spy, then made his way<br />
around the table to where they were standing.  He hovered over the<br />
Ubertuber and inhaled deeply.</p>
<p>The Duke smiled.  "You have a point, sir!  Tell me, what is his name?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"Oh introductions! How shockingly rude of me.</p>
<p>Your grace! I have the singular honour of presenting ... "</p>
<p>The tiniest moment of confusion at the realisation Hugh had no idea was blown past quickly.</p>
<p>"The man that smelt of potato. Of the famous Tuber family. And may I say, he&#039;s delighted to make your graces acquantaince!"</p>
