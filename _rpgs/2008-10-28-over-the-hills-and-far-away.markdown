<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>They got to the castle door and turned towards the stables. Ilandra<br />
struggling to maintain her dignity while wearing a fluffy dressing<br />
gown. As they entered the stables, Ilandra stopped.</p>
<p>"Right, this is ridiculous, I need to get something on cos this<br />
dressing gown is too revealing." She said, delving into her handbag and<br />
pulling out a dress and some worn out shoes. "Now, we are going to need<br />
a horse, cos there&#039;s no way you can carry that heavy bag all the time<br />
without getting tired. Do we have any that are strong enough to carry<br />
us and your bag?"</p>
<p>She put the dress on, using a saddling area for cover. She left the<br />
dressing gown hung up on a hook, as she figured they wouldn&#039;t need a<br />
fluffy dressing gown.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, they&#039;ve all been doing pretty much that for years now.  The<br />
war&#039;s taken it&#039;s toll in a lot of ways, and one of them is that there<br />
aren&#039;t a lot of spare horses around any more", said Cain.</p>
<p>He began to walk alongside the stables.  "Much as I doubt he&#039;ll<br />
appreciate being ridden again so soon, we could always take mine."</p>
<p>Cain unbolted one of the stable doors, and stepped inside.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra watched in fascination as Cain brushed the huge brown horse<br />
down. She had to withhold a gasp of surprise as it didn&#039;t step on his<br />
feet. Tentatively she moved towards them.</p>
<p>"It won&#039;t tread on me, will it?" she asked, realising she always panicked this way when faced with horses.</p>
<p>"Of course he won&#039;t" said Cain patting the horse on the nose. Hearing<br />
this, she moved towards the great beast and helped Cain brush it down<br />
and saddle it, her fear subsiding as the horse didn&#039;t tread on her.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Once they were done, Cain led Ilandra and his horse out into the<br />
courtyard and shut the stable door quietly behind them.  He threw<br />
his bag up behind the saddle and lashed it on, before springing easily<br />
up into the saddle himself and offering his hand to Ilandra.</p>
<p>Ilandra followed him up without hesitation, keen to get away from the horse&#039;s feet.</p>
<p>Then, once they were finally ready, Cain reached around Ilandra to pat<br />
his horse on the head.  "Come on, Hawthorn," he said, shaking the<br />
reins and sending them trotting off into the sunset.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>As they left the castle grounds, Ilandra told Cain they were going<br />
left. Then leaning back into his body, allowed the horse to take them<br />
off on their next adventure.</p>
<p>After about twenty minutes, Ilandra was starting to get impatient so she turned around and could still see the castle.</p>
<p>"You know, I&#039;m not sure left was the right way..." she said, "I can<br />
still see the castle, at this rate we&#039;ll still be in Poppy lands when<br />
your mum notices."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, we&#039;re only a couple of miles away.  We could go faster, if you like."</p>
<p>"Okay," said Ilandra, and Cain pulled his knees in and spurred Hawthorn into a canter.</p>
<p>Before another half hour had passed, they had crested a hill and ridden<br />
down into the leafy valley beyond, the rise obscuring the tall spires<br />
of Castle Poppy from view as night closed in around them.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>As night descended and the stars came out, Ilandra wrapped Cain&#039;s arms<br />
tighter around her shoulders in the hope of not obviously shivering.<br />
She did so carefully, so as not to disturb the reins. Sighing she<br />
wondered what would happen over the next few days.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s such a nice evening... I&#039;m glad you&#039;re here." she told him, smiling contentedly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Ilandra was not altogether successful in hiding her shivering.<br />
Cain removed his coat and wrapped it around Ilandra, then began to<br />
fumble around the bag behind him to find his cloak.</p>
<p>Cain hugged her more tightly, and their canter continued along the<br />
bottom of the valley where their thin track was joined by a tiny river<br />
that bubbled and gurgled and shone with the faint light of the crescent<br />
moon.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>After what seemed like an eternity of pretty night-time scenes, Ilandra<br />
felt her eyelids droop slightly. She fought the sleepiness for a while,<br />
but eventually felt compelled to regale the world with one of her most<br />
copious yawns.</p>
<p><i>I know I&#039;m going to fall off this terror machine... If I lean further into Cain, he&#039;ll stop me falling off.</i></p>
<p>Snuggling further into Cain&#039;s arms, she began to fall asleep.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>As Ilandra fell deeper into dreams, memories came back,almost unbidden<br />
of happier days. Days where she was not only a princess, but also a<br />
treasured pet. She dreamt of all the times she&#039;d fallen asleep in<br />
Cain&#039;s arms, under the guise of "Fluffy" his pet cat, and been told all<br />
about his day. She also remembered the feeling of belonging that she<br />
had experienced.<br />
Her dreams also led her to (her perception of) the future, where she<br />
and Cain where allowed to run around her house doing whatever they<br />
wanted without anyone around to shout at them for breaking the<br />
furniture.<br />
All in all, Ilandra was happy, you could tell, she was purring quite<br />
loudly in her sleep. She shifted position slightly and allowed her<br />
dreams to take her wherever they wanted.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Ilandra shifted slightly, and her eyes flickered open.  Before her<br />
shone an eternity of stars, much brighter in Faerie than in other<br />
worlds, framed by silhouetted branches of an old and tall tree.</p>
<p>After a brief moment to recalibrate her senses, she found herself lying<br />
with her head and torso resting against Cain, who in turn was<br />
half-sitting, half-lying against a thick clump of tree roots.  The<br />
horse was tied up near by, and from the former&#039;s stillness and the<br />
latter&#039;s snoring, she figured both Cain and Hawthorn to be asleep.</p>
<p>A gentle breeze blew along the valley, rustling the leaves overhead and<br />
continually shifting Ilandra&#039;s view of the blazing night sky.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>She laid as still as possible for a few minutes before deciding the one<br />
thing they needed the most was a small fire and marshmallows. She got<br />
up, looked around to make sure there were no immediate threats and<br />
wandered into the trees to pick up suitable firewood.</p>
<p>Having picked up some firewood, she returned to where she&#039;d left Cain<br />
and set up a small fire-shaped pile of wood. She started rubbing the<br />
wood together and soon had a small fire. Looking back at her lover, she<br />
smiled to herself and rummaged in her bag to produce a rather sizeable<br />
bag of marshmallows.</p>
<p>Standing up and reaching as high as she could, she tried to break a<br />
twig off the tree, but found she was too short. Cursing beneath her<br />
breath she started to climb the tree, cursing a little louder each time<br />
her dress snagged on a twig. Finding two suitable sticks for in case<br />
Cain woke up, she climbed back down and sat beside the fire again.<br />
Movement nearby startled her, but when she saw it was only Cain she<br />
relaxed and proffered one of the two sticks she&#039;d picked and some<br />
marshmallows.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain clamped his eyes shut against the bright light of the fire, and<br />
kept them shut until the after-images faded.  Then, slowly, giving<br />
him chance to adjust to the brightness, he opened them and took a<br />
marshmallow-endowed stick from Ilandra.</p>
<p>"Say, Ilandra," Cain said sleepily, "we&#039;ll be out of Poppy lands by<br />
this time tomorrow.  Did you plan on going... anywhere in<br />
particular?"  He kissed her lightly on the cheek, and idly turned<br />
his marshmallow.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra smiled, her hand instinctively going to her cheek as she turned<br />
red. She removed her marshmallow from the fire, and waved it a bit to<br />
put the flame out then blew on it before she answered the question.</p>
<p>"Well, the way I figure it, if we go to anyone to get married secretly<br />
it&#039;ll be the talk of Faerie how Honeysuckle sided with X to get married<br />
and are therefore not neutral. So therefore, the only way we can do<br />
this without too much backlash is to go to the High Council and ask<br />
them nicely if they would mind officiating. Also, if we don&#039;t invite<br />
_every_ house in Faerie, we&#039;ll get accused of siding with people." she<br />
told him, looking thoughtfully into the fire. "I know it sounds like<br />
I&#039;m trying to put the wedding back, but it might endanger our lives if<br />
we don&#039;t do it this way." She moved her hand from her cheek to the<br />
collar he&#039;d once so lovingly put around her neck and fidgeted<br />
absent-mindedly with the bell.</p>
<p>"Also, I&#039;ll probably need tuition in politics if I&#039;m to be a good<br />
Duchess... I don&#039;t know very much at the moment." she told him, "I<br />
considered asking your mother, but she&#039;d gloat too much..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m exactly the world&#039;s greatest politician either; we both might need tuition when it comes to that.</p>
<p>"But the Council, are you sure?  Obviously we have to <i>invite</i><br />
everybody, but asking a Councillor to officiate?  Neither of us<br />
are all that important in their grand plans; they probably barely care<br />
about our marriage or our Houses..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Why not the Council?" she asked defiantly. "If we get one from each<br />
side, they&#039;ll be sufficiently reassured that we wish to be neutral<br />
rather than if we got a neutral person. A neutral person would be far<br />
more challenging to find, I think, than to just go and ask nicely." she<br />
looked at him, as if to gauge his response, and munched on her now cold<br />
marshmallow.</p>
<p>"I suppose so," said Cain.  "As far as I know there&#039;s not been a<br />
marriage even as important as ours since the war began, so we have<br />
concerns over this that no-one&#039;s had to deal with before.  And,<br />
thinking about it, the Council&#039;s about the only place these days that<br />
you&#039;d find a Red and a White working together.  Bar your hospital,<br />
of course."</p>
<p>"Though that said, I could probably bribe Bartholomew and Dexter into<br />
it. But it just seems more fitting for it to be done by Dukes." she<br />
said. "You thought of those two before I did... And then you say you&#039;re<br />
not the best politician, I barely know whose side you&#039;re on. Though<br />
that said, I&#039;m mostly looking forward to finding a suitable uniform for<br />
you that doesn&#039;t look too much like a uniform... oh and bunny slippers<br />
in your shoe size might be interesting to knit." they both laughed at<br />
the suggestion of bunny slippers. When they stopped laughing Ilandra<br />
changed the subject.</p>
<p>"I watched you sleep earlier, you looked really peaceful," she told<br />
him, blushing slightly, "I hope you slept well... And I feel I need to<br />
excuse my behaviour earlier, I don&#039;t normally drink that much."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Hah, it&#039;s okay," said Cain, hugging Ilandra around her shoulders and<br />
pulling her closer to him.  "Not everybody has my brother&#039;s<br />
alcohol tolerance!"</p>
<p>Having toasted it thoroughly, Cain ate his marshmallow then stared up<br />
at the sky, trying to remember the stories for each of the<br />
constellations of the Spring.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra relaxed into the hug. <i>he doesn&#039;t burn the marshmallows like I do... wow!</i></p>
<p>She put another marshmallow on her stick.</p>
<p>"You know, if I hadn&#039;t always kept on insisting on running away from<br />
home and camping in the Honeysuckle grounds, I&#039;d have never learnt to<br />
make fire and toast marshmallows like this..." she said, absently.<br />
"Though that said, I was really happy that summer when you, Lysander<br />
and Abel came along for one of my trips. That was really kind of you.<br />
Especially the way I always used to react." she blushed bright red. "I<br />
guess we all show fondness differently." she looked into his eyes "I<br />
always wanted to apologise for that, but never really knew how to...<br />
also, Abel insinuated you were upset that I was Fluffy... so I figured<br />
I&#039;d let you know something." she stretched across and kissed him.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m all yours, Cain. I give myself to you until the end of time. All<br />
my land and property are yours also, to do with as you wish..." she<br />
told him, earnestly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Ours, Ilandra.  <i>Ours</i>, to do with as <i>we</i><br />
wish.  I... don&#039;t want you to feel like you have to give something<br />
up to be with me."  He paused.  "That is, I mean, um...<br />
Not that it&#039;s a bad thing to have to give up something to be with the<br />
one you love, because, well, I guess I don&#039;t mind losing the stuff I&#039;m<br />
losing, but...  You&#039;re in the best situation, where you don&#039;t have<br />
to lose anything at all, so please just... use &#039;us&#039; rather than &#039;you&#039;<br />
and &#039;me&#039;..." said Cain, earnestly trying to put a point across but<br />
failing horribly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"us..." she said, slowly. "It feels strange saying that..."</p>
<p>"OK, well tomorrow we shall sort out where we stand in regards to our<br />
allegiances and land and stuff. Right now, I&#039;m happy here." she hugged<br />
him. "I&#039;m not so tired any more, we have two choices, either carry on<br />
eating marshmallows wait til dawn and go to the council or get off your<br />
mother&#039;s land and go back to mine, <i>ours</i>,<br />
for hot cocoa. Either way, we should go to the council tomorrow...<br />
Either way, when you see our room you are totally going to schiz!"</p>
<p>She intercepted Cain&#039;s marshmallow as he tried to eat it, holding it<br />
between her lips teasingly for a few seconds before just eating it.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Hot cocoa?  You&#039;re bored of running away already, aren&#039;t you?"<br />
asked Cain.  "Still, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s going to be possible<br />
tonight.  We&#039;ll not have left Poppy lands for a good eight hours<br />
of walking yet, and Hawthorn&#039;s not in any state to carry us any<br />
more.  For tonight, can we just enjoy being together under the<br />
stars?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked offended at the suggestion.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m not bored... but we only have a bag of marshmallows and a block of<br />
fudge to stop us from starving. Our house can pick us up and deposit us<br />
anywhere we want it to... there&#039;s no reason we can&#039;t pilfer some food<br />
from the pantry and then carry on running away. Then there&#039;s the<br />
problem of breakfast, I doubt you&#039;ve ever had to forage for your<br />
breakfast so it&#039;d all be left to me... and I don&#039;t think I have any<br />
frying pans in my bag." she told him. "Lying here under the stars,<br />
however is a marvellous idea... even if surviving out in the open is<br />
looking daunting. I suppose we could pose as low-ranking nobles and<br />
hope that if we pass through any lands people don&#039;t assume we&#039;re<br />
enemies... even if we do have a death-machine with us."</p>
<p>Having said her piece she rooted around in her bag and pulled out a<br />
block of home-made fudge and offered it to Cain, still in it&#039;s muslin<br />
wrap.</p>
<p>"See? No healthy foods." she said, smiling a little. "Though, I&#039;m not<br />
sure you&#039;re healthy either..." she continued, giggling, as she pushed<br />
him to the ground playfully.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain grabbed Ilandra&#039;s shoulder as he fell, and pulled her down with him.</p>
<p>"Hey, and whose fault is it we&#039;re out here?"</p>
<p>He grabbed her, and rolled over so that he was almost lying on top of her, supported only by his arms.</p>
<p>"You&#039;re not that healthy for me, either!" said Cain, smiling.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>She giggled some more and tried to tickle him, but failed as he put up resistance.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s your fault we&#039;re out here, I merely suggested it, but you openly<br />
encouraged it." she told him, playfully batting at his hands. "After<br />
all, you&#039;re older than me, so you should be more responsible old man."</p>
<p>She rolled him over so he was underneath this time and tried to tickle him again, giggling the entire time.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain allowed himself to be tickled for a few seconds this time, before<br />
grabbing Ilandra&#039;s arms and rolling again, pinning her to the ground.</p>
<p>"Yes, of course I should be the responsible one, <i>Your Grace</i>."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I hate being a duchess..." Ilandra said, the mirth evaporating<br />
slightly from her face. "But seeing as how you own me, it shouldn&#039;t<br />
matter what I am..."</p>
<p>He looked slightly bemused at the suggestion of ownership.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s your collar I have round my neck..." she pointed out. "Take some<br />
responsibility for your pet cat." and giggled again, pretending to<br />
struggle as she talked.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain lowered himself gently down so that he was no longer supporting<br />
himself with his arms, and ran one of his hands along the edge of<br />
Ilandra&#039;s collar.</p>
<p>"Yeah," he sighed, and kissed her.</p>
<p>As he broke away, he raised himself up a little, and looked her in the eyes.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m...  I&#039;m sorry for leaving you for so long."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, I did miss hearing about your days..." she said, stretching up to kiss him. "Also, the quality of the food worsened..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I never did ask you, how on earth did you survive two years?  It<br />
can&#039;t have been easy getting by, hanging around a castle under enemy<br />
control..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, lets just say no-one ever hurts the adorable little kitty that<br />
insists on sleeping on the prince&#039;s bed." she said, smiling<br />
enigmatically. "besides, i had to keep your stuff safe... So half the<br />
time i was rearranging furniture and waiting at the foot of your bed..."<br />
She shrugged as if it hadn&#039;t bothered her.<br />
"anyway it&#039;s not like there was anyone around for them to kill... I<br />
didn&#039;t mind too much that way... and if they got too close it&#039;s not<br />
like i can&#039;t defend myself..." a look of concern flashed across her<br />
face.</p>
<p>"How did you get by on the road? Weren&#039;t you scared?" she asked.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Scared of what?" asked Cain.  "We stuck to the lands of Red<br />
Houses, so it&#039;s not as if we were running from battles every day.<br />
And weak as we are, we still have soldiers.  It would have been a<br />
stupid bandit group indeed who&#039;d attack an entire House on the move.</p>
<p>"In fact, thinking about it, that did happen once or twice.  They were very stupid though."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I... I didn&#039;t know, I just assumed you&#039;d all packed up and gone off to<br />
war..." she said, "I saw lots of metal-reinforced death-machines and<br />
figured that&#039;s what you were doing. So I resolved if I was gonna stay<br />
behind I was at least going to make a name for myself... There&#039;s<br />
probably brigades from House White Rose who&#039;ll probably shudder at the<br />
memory of the psycho cat of House Poppy, not to mention the fact that<br />
most of the opposition are convinced your Castle is haunted." she<br />
laughed a little. "It was mostly entertaining... but I figured you&#039;d be<br />
in danger all the time and would probably come back a Duke or<br />
something..."</p>
<p>She pulled him to the ground beside her.</p>
<p>"I was so scared you&#039;d get hurt I had Grizzel keep an eye on you and<br />
pick you up if you got even a tiny little scratch." she leant her head<br />
on his shoulder. "Not that I need have bothered, if you weren&#039;t in that<br />
much danger... did you fight all the bandits off on your own? That&#039;s<br />
quite brave!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, I, er..." Cain began, blushing.  "I might have done at one<br />
point, whilst Nyano and most of the army were off looking for a spot to<br />
camp in.  Seems they were pretty skilful to evade the attentions<br />
of the scouts.  Not smart enough to run away from Abel and I,<br />
though."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"You&#039;re really brave! And I bet you&#039;re really strong and good at<br />
fighting!" Ilandra gushed, not quite able to hide the admiration in her<br />
voice. She stroked his neck bone, thoughtfully, pausing occasionally to<br />
kiss his neck.</p>
<p>She smiled at him, "I guess you probably had a million girls tell you<br />
how wonderful you were... so I&#039;m glad you picked me. You really are<br />
great... I bet the bandits probably wanted to run away when they saw<br />
how awesome you were..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I think it was more the charging horse and drawn sword that did it,<br />
but..."  Cain sighed.  "Anyway, we&#039;re home now, and I&#039;m with<br />
you, and that&#039;s all that matters."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"hmm..." Ilandra said, "it is important... If you hadn&#039;t come back... life would be very strange."</p>
<p>She fidgeted with a button on Cain&#039;s shirt, absent-mindedly twisting it and undoing it.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m sure the bandits weren&#039;t just running from the horse..." she<br />
fidgeted with another button, the first one having lost her interest,<br />
then sighed deeply, clearly contented to be there.</p>
<p>"I have an idea for a really fun game! We could pretend like we&#039;re<br />
peasants when we leave your land and deny all knowledge of who we are<br />
until we decide to go back home, or get to the council." she looked<br />
wistful, clearly enchanted by the idea of being just herself and not a<br />
duchess.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Sounds like fun," said Cain.  "We might have to wear somewhat<br />
simpler and dirtier clothes, though.  And muddy our faces, and<br />
speak... commonly.  Actually, I&#039;m not entirely sure how to do<br />
that..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra surveyed her dress, it was quite torn and dirty.  The<br />
fabric wouldn&#039;t give her away as being slightly richer than the average<br />
peasant, as it was cotton, but the deep pink might alert people on<br />
close inspection.</p>
<p>"I don&#039;t think I need to change my dress too much, maybe fray the edges<br />
a little more..." she said, thoughtfully. "You on the other hand...<br />
you&#039;ll have to remove that dinner suit..." she blushed at the thought<br />
of seeing him unclothed again. "Let&#039;s see what we have to work with..."<br />
she brought his bag to him and rummaged around inside it, pulling out a<br />
white cotton shirt with plain buttons. She set this aside and rummaged<br />
again, this time not pulling anything out. She then rummaged in her own<br />
bag and pulled out a pair of scissors.</p>
<p>"We&#039;ll have to chop those trousers up a little... not to mention<br />
fraying the shirt sleeves at the ends, that shirt looks too new..." she<br />
handed him the scissors and indicated roughly how long peasant trousers<br />
tended to be. Then, developing claws on one hand set to fraying the<br />
shirt sleeves.</p>
<p>After she&#039;d done that, she looked over him, and handed him the frayed shirt.</p>
<p>"I&#039;ll help you with that shirt if you like..." she said, smiling shyly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, um, okay," Cain said, smiling shyly.</p>
<p>"I hope this works, though.  I mean, you could probably pass, but<br />
I&#039;m just not particularly... peasanty.  I&#039;ve never had the same<br />
kind of relationship with subjects as you&#039;ve had, but I kind of wish I<br />
had..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>She smiled, while undoing his buttons.</p>
<p>"If I can make you look like a squire at least then you can pretend I&#039;m<br />
your maid... so you&#039;ll have to get used to me fussing over you..." she<br />
told him, laying a small kiss on his solar plexus.</p>
<p>"Failing that, you could just not talk and I&#039;ll do all the negotiating<br />
with other peasants, then you can bail us out if there&#039;s any barons or<br />
knights getting angry at us." She&#039;d reached the last button, but<br />
couldn&#039;t bring herself to remove the shirt... so she wrapped her arms<br />
around him and snuggled up to him.</p>
<p>"I only get along with our peasants because they are few, so I have<br />
them over for dinner most nights... it keeps cook occupied and the<br />
peasants tend to work even harder on the fields during the day.<br />
Sometimes we even play board games if the weather is inclement, but<br />
it&#039;s only because otherwise I&#039;d get lonely. I&#039;ll keep the habit of<br />
having them around if I can get away with it... otherwise I&#039;ll just<br />
drop food parcels round their houses. Besides, it&#039;s useful to get along<br />
with one&#039;s peasants... how else do you get rid of clothes that no<br />
longer fit?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I always thought that you got seamstresses to alter them, but<br />
still...  It might be a little strange for a squire to have a<br />
maid, so there&#039;ll need to be some excuse - either that our Knight gave<br />
you to my keeping, or that we&#039;re all that remain of his<br />
household.  We&#039;ll have to pretend to be from somewhere obscure and<br />
far away, so that no-one can dispute our claims..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"But where is there that&#039;s obscure and far away?" she asked, perplexed.<br />
"I guess you could be a knight, you have the... er... the... body for<br />
it..." she turned a cute shade of pink.</p>
<p>"Er... sorry, it wasn&#039;t meant to sound like that... I could try again..." she told somewhere around his waist...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"It&#039;s okay," said Cain, rather a shade of crimson himself.  When<br />
Ilandra finally looked up, Cain hugged her tightly and rolled, sending<br />
both of them spinning together across the ground.</p>
<p>By the time they stopped against a tree and relaxed their embrace, both of them were laughing hysterically.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra stopped laughing and kissed him, slowly and deeply, putting all<br />
her emotions into it. When she pulled away, she looked into his eyes.</p>
<p>"At your service, sir Knight" she said, giggling. "We&#039;ll have to think up names for each other..."</p>
<p>She kissed him again, feeling herself get lost in his arms...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Mmm, there&#039;ll be time for that in the morning," said Cain, and continued the kiss.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I can&#039;t wait..." murmured Ilandra, running her hands softly down his<br />
back. Then caressing his lower back, she rejoined the kiss, allowing<br />
her hands to take themselves wherever they felt right.</p>
<p>"I love you." she murmured the next time the kiss allowed a break.</p>

<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>A solitary cockerel crowed in the distance as the first tendrils of<br />
light crept across the hills.  Yet there was no stirring in the<br />
forest glade where two young lovers slept in each others&#039; embrace.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, as the sunlight finally made it through the trees<br />
to illuminate the ground below, they were still fast asleep.  It<br />
took still an hour more, until their horse was sufficiently worried<br />
that he started nuzzling the two faeries, before Ilandra finally<br />
returned to the world.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra ()</b></p>
<p>The first thing Ilandra noticed as she woke up was the horse, nuzzling<br />
the two of them. As she took stock of the situation, panic took over<br />
and she let out a scream before jumping up and running up the tree<br />
behind her, in cat form.</p>
<p>From her vantage point on the branch she could see she&#039;d left her dress behind in the panic.</p>
<p><i>great, now the death machine is going to eat my favourite dress! Oh god, it&#039;s going to eat Cain!!! What do I do? What do I do?</i></p>
<p>She watched in abject terror as the horse didn&#039;t in fact eat Cain or<br />
her dress, then started feeling really dumb as she realised this was<br />
probably some evil trick. She resolved to stay up the tree until she<br />
either knew what was going on or was told the <s>death machine</s> horse wouldn&#039;t eat her.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Awakened by the dual sensory inputs of Ilandra&#039;s scream and Hawthorn<br />
licking his face, Cain woke up in quite the state of confusion.<br />
He sat up, pushing the horse&#039;s head away, and looked around with<br />
increasing panic as he could not find Ilandra.</p>
<p>Worried that he could not see his fiancÈe, Cain stood and hit his head<br />
on a low branch of the tree that they had slept under.  He was<br />
greeted with a shower of leaves and a surprised yowl.</p>
<p>At last he looked up and noticed Ilandra, and his worry melted into a smile.</p>
<p>"Ilandra?" he asked.  "Why are you all the way up there?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"It was trying to eat me!" she said, her voice betraying the fear she<br />
was feeling. "I&#039;ll come down, but you have to promise that death<br />
machine isn&#039;t going to eat me."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Death machine?  Eat you?" Cain asked.  He patted Hawthorn on<br />
the head, and offered him a sugar lump that had somehow appeared in his<br />
hand.</p>
<p>"Ilandra dear, Hawthorn wouldn&#039;t hurt a fly!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"You promise?" she asked, still unsure. He nodded.</p>
<p>"Can you pass me my dress please, and look away." she asked, tail twitching slightly. <i>mind you, is it proper to ask him to look away in light of recent events?</i> "well... ok, you can look if you really want... but can I please have a dress?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Um... Sure," said Cain, picking the dress up from the ground.  He<br />
threw it up onto the low branch on which Ilandra was perched, then<br />
turned away to blush furiously at some point in the far distance.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Taking the dress, she ran up to a higher branch where she morphed back<br />
into human form and put it on, then climbed towards the edge of the<br />
branch and jumped down to the ground landing about a foot or so away<br />
from Cain.</p>
<p>"Right, I&#039;m ready. What&#039;s the plan? Also, thinking of names, how&#039;s<br />
Gerald?" she asked, looking around for her bag to eat some more<br />
marshmallows. Having found the bag, she offered Cain a marshmallow.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Mmmf," Cain said with a mouthful of marshmallow.  "Gerald?  I gueff."</p>
<p>Cain swallowed.</p>
<p>"I didn&#039;t have a <i>plan</i>, though.  I figured you did..."</p>
<p>Ilandra shook her head.</p>
<p>"Right, well, um...  To be honest, I&#039;m not really very good at<br />
plans.  Since neither of us have one, why don&#039;t we just keep<br />
riding until we find somewhere we like?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"That&#039;s an excellent plan!" she said. "Also, we&#039;ll probably have to<br />
move quite fast, otherwise your mum will catch up with us and eat us<br />
for being bad."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"It&#039;s alright," said Cain, "we&#039;ll be outside of Poppy lands soon<br />
enough.  My mother&#039;s got enough to worry about without trying to<br />
chase after us as well."</p>
<p>Sensing Ilandra&#039;s nervousness to approach Hawthorn, Cain saddled and<br />
mounted the horse before hauling Ilandra up into the saddle in front of<br />
him.  Then, with a cuddle from the couple and a snort from the<br />
horse they were off again, following the remainder of the valley up<br />
toward the West.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>As they started riding off, Ilandra snuggled into Cain&#039;s arms.</p>
<p><i>While he&#039;s here, nothing can hurt me... I ought to protect him like he protects me.</i></p>
<p>"Caaaain?" she asked. He murmured a response so she continued. "If<br />
you&#039;re gonna be Gerald, I need to change my name to something more<br />
mundane... kinda like maybe Mavis... but if you know of a name you&#039;d<br />
prefer let me know." She snuggled up to the crook of his arm, kissing<br />
the inside of the elbow joint.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Mavis?" Cain asked.  "Dear Ilandra, where <i>do</i> you get such names from?  Still, if you like, Mavis it is."</p>
<p>Around mid-morning, the valley in which they had been travelling<br />
rapidly steepened, and their trot almost became a climb.  The<br />
ground got steadily more rocky, and after a while they found the<br />
river&#039;s source as it emerged from an outcrop of stone in the hillside.</p>
<p>They reached the top just as the sun disappeared behind a thick<br />
cloud.  The sky had been becoming more overcast all morning, and<br />
now as they stood atop the hill and looked down at the next valley<br />
spread out beneath them, the air began to smell strongly of rain.</p>
<p>Whilst the top of the hill was windswept and bare, the forest that had<br />
featured strongly in the last valley persisted in the next one, bar a<br />
few clearings.  In one of these, faintly visible at a couple of<br />
hours&#039; riding distance, stood what seemed to be a solitary<br />
cottage.  No smoke curled from its chimney, and nothing stirred in<br />
the valley but the tops of trees blown by the strengthening wind.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra&#039;s head was beginning to pound and the world was looking<br />
altogether too bright for her liking. Even the threat of rain served<br />
little to alleviate the oppressive feeling of her headache. She groaned<br />
slightly as an errant ray of light caught her eye.</p>
<p>"I think I need a new skull... this one&#039;s altogether too small for<br />
me..." she said quietly, biting back the urge to hide under Cain&#039;s<br />
cloak. She covered her eyes as a temporary measure and hoped for the<br />
best. "Also, I don&#039;t really like mavis... it sounds old, like grizzel<br />
old..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Oh, you poor thing!" exclaimed Cain.  "You must&#039;ve drunk so much<br />
last night, and we haven&#039;t had a drop of water since.  Come on,<br />
let&#039;s get to that house as quickly as we can, and hope they have a<br />
well!"</p>
<p>So saying, Cain spurred Hawthorn into a canter, and they raced down into the valley.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s not as if Gerald&#039;s a particularly young name either!" said Cain,<br />
raising his voice against the wind.  "Still, what&#039;s normal and<br />
young?  Sarah?  Janet?  Rachel?"</p>
<p>Just as he finished his question, the world jarred for a second as if<br />
space and time were knocked out of alignment by a sledgehammer to the<br />
skull, disorienting Cain and not at all helping Ilandra&#039;s<br />
hangover.  Hawthorn slowed, clearly nervous about going further.</p>
<p>"What in all of Faerie was <i>that</i>?" exclaimed Cain.  He<br />
thought for a moment.  "I think this is one of the borders of<br />
Poppy lands; I remember that much.  But I&#039;ve never felt <i>that</i> before.  I wonder where we are..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>As the world lurched, Ilandra&#039;s headache worsened. Unable to bear the<br />
increased pain, her body did the only thing it could think of.</p>
<p>She felt herself falling away from the relative safety of the horse,<br />
and then upon hitting the ground vomited in a very unladylike way.<br />
Reverting back to the relative safety of cat form, she decided sleep<br />
would be a good plan... now if only she could persuade her stomach that<br />
vomiting more would be a bad idea.</p>
<p><i>I&#039;m staying here, til the world stops spinning... oh gods it&#039;s far too bright... and I feel so sick...</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain jumped down from Hawthorn, ran to Ilandra and stroked her back until the she stopped being sick.</p>
<p>"Come on," he said, trying to coax her back onto the horse.<br />
"We&#039;ll find out what that was all about later.  For now, let&#039;s get<br />
you to that cottage so you can drink some water and lie down."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"mm staying here." she groaned. "here doesn&#039;t throw me off huge things and cause too much pain... here&#039;s good..."</p>
<p>She put a paw over her eyes.</p>
<p>"you can go to the cottage... but please avenge my death..." so saying she allowed herself to fall asleep.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Your death?"  Cain sighed.  "Ilandra, you&#039;re not<br />
dying.  It&#039;s just a hangover.  And I&#039;m not leaving you here."</p>
<p>Taking advantage of Ilandra&#039;s cat-like size and weight, Cain lifted her<br />
up and placed her gently in one of the side-pockets of Hawthorn&#039;s<br />
saddle.  Then he climbed up himself, and they set off towards the<br />
cottage again.</p>
<p>It took well over an hour for them to finally reach the clearing in<br />
which the cottage sat, by which point the weather had turned decidedly<br />
wet.  The air was thick with drizzle, the kind that infiltrates<br />
your clothes without you noticing until you&#039;re suddenly soaked through.</p>
<p>In the mist that the drizzle kicked up, visibility was low.  Thus,<br />
it was quite a surprise when they finally came across the cottage<br />
itself looming out of the mist.</p>
<p>Cain reined in his horse, but stayed in the saddle.  He poked the feline bundle behind him.</p>
<p>"Er, Ilandra," he said.</p>
<p>Ilandra rolled over, muttering.  "Five more minutes, Lysander, I&#039;m comfy now."</p>
<p>Cain poked again.</p>
<p>"Ilandra.  You might want to take a look at this."</p>
<p>She opened an eye.  Before her, rising out of the greyness, stood<br />
the very sme cottage they had spied from atop the hill.  Just as<br />
they had expected, it was a normal and quite inviting cottage.  Or<br />
would have been, had the whole thing not been made of gingerbread.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>She climbed gingerly out of the saddle bag, morphing back to her fae form (looking a lot paler and sicklier than usual).</p>
<p>"Gingerbread... mmmm... gingerbread..." she said, moving towards it. "Wait, why do i get a bad feeling about this?"</p>
<p><font color="red">Rolls for hearth wisdom plus wits, losing two dice for being hungover... so... two dice then... ok, three successes</font></p>
<p>"We might not wanna go near this cottage... it feels wrong. Kinda like<br />
that legend about the kids." she told him. "Anyways, I&#039;m feeling a<br />
little better... sorry for worrying you... shall we get moving?"</p>
<p>She climbed back onto the horse in front of him, where she stole some of his cloak to keep herself warm.</p>
<p>"I think I might still be dying, just a lot less painfully now..." she<br />
said. "Though that said, if it&#039;s a hangover, Abel told me about<br />
those... you get them when Regara sits on your head while you sleep,<br />
right?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"When... Regara..."  Cain paused.  "That Abel, I&#039;ll have words with him when we get home."</p>
<p>"But still," he continued, "even if you don&#039;t want to take shelter inside, let&#039;s at least find the well and get you some water."</p>
<p>"No, I don&#039;t think we should go to the well," said Ilandra.  "If the legend is true, then the witch will come and eat us!"</p>
<p>Cain thought for a moment.</p>
<p>"There&#039;s no witch alive whom I&#039;d let lay a finger on you," said Cain.  "But if you insist - and if you&#039;re <i>sure</i> you&#039;d prefer to carry on than fetch water...?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I&#039;ll just snooze it off here..." she snuggled a little bit<br />
further into his arms. "You&#039;re really warm... hope you don&#039;t mind..."</p>
<p>She wrapped her arms around his arm and leant her head on his bicep then gave out a contented sigh.</p>
<p>"Also, you shouldn&#039;t be too hard on Abel... I think at the time I<br />
probably caught him off guard... he was complaining of a hangover to<br />
lysander..." she mused, "I had to ask what it was..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"It&#039;s okay," said Cain.  "I understand.  Come on, let&#039;s get moving!"</p>
<p>Cain dug his heels in, and Hawthorn began to trot, then canter, then gallop, forward into the rain-soaked forest.</p>
<p>Deep in the darkness of a nearby bush, two sets of beady eyes watched them leave...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>From her resting place in Cain&#039;s arms, Ilandra half dozed half watched the world go by.</p>
<p>After a while curiosity got the better of her and she asked "Cain, is<br />
it true you didn&#039;t mean to give me that record when you did? Cos I was<br />
told you only did it cos the guys told you it was a good idea to give<br />
me... you don&#039;t really have to answer, but it&#039;s been bugging me..."</p>
<p>She wasn&#039;t entirely sure she was ready for the answer, but she had to<br />
know if it had just been her brother trying to push them together...<br />
she snuggled into his cloak a little more, glad she was able to spend<br />
so much time with her fiancÈ.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"That record?  What on earth are you-" began Cain, before he<br />
realised what she meant.  "What, when you were eleven?<br />
&#039;Didn&#039;t mean to give it to you&#039;?  Really, what are you talking<br />
about?  It was ages ago, it was your birthday, I gave you a<br />
present, you liked it.  Or at least you seemed to.  Did you<br />
not, after all?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, the song was quite... suggestive and stuff... and it seemed to<br />
put your brother and mine into hysterics... and then the maid said it<br />
was them that chose it and told you to give it to me..." she said,<br />
blushing slightly. "I tried to approach you to thank you properly at<br />
the time, but I wasn&#039;t sure if you had heard it."</p>
<p>She looked down at the ground, fidgeting with a bit of Hawthorn&#039;s mane and blushing furiously.</p>
<p>"If you haven&#039;t heard the song, I&#039;ll play it to you some time... I think the player Gustafssen made still works..."</p>
<p>(the song was Wham- I&#039;m your man)</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Suggestive?  Of what?" Cain asked.  "Besides, surely the important thing is whether you liked it or not..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked up at Cain, her cheeks still bright red.</p>
<p>"It doesn&#039;t matter, I loved it... I&#039;m sorry." she reached a hand up to<br />
stroke his cheek. "Just, that day I thought you meant something by it,<br />
and Lysander said you were too old for someone like me and that I<br />
should concentrate on my studies. I guess I was a little confused at<br />
the time."</p>
<p>She morphed into a cat to turn in the saddle and morphed back to fae form, this time facing him and wrapped her arms around him.</p>
<p>"I think we should stop soon and get you some breakfast..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Meant something by it?  I, er, just meant for the present to make you happy.  Um, sorry..."</p>
<p>"Right, breakfast, yes," continued Cain.  "Not that I can see very<br />
far in this rain, but it didn&#039;t look like there was anything like a<br />
village up ahead.  Unless you&#039;ve got any more food in that bag of<br />
yours, I&#039;m not sure what we&#039;d be able to eat in a place like this."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra picked the bag up and rummaged in it, pulling out the lump of fudge.</p>
<p>"Well, it&#039;s either this or marshmallows... I helped make this fudge, so<br />
it&#039;ll be nice..." she handed the lump to him. "I&#039;m not really hungry,<br />
so you can have it..." she said, her stomach belying her last<br />
sentence... so she reached into the bag and pulled out some<br />
marshmallows.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m sorry too... I shouldn&#039;t have brought such irrelevant stuff up." she said, eating a marshmallow.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"It&#039;s okay," said Cain, breaking off some fudge and handing the rest<br />
back to Ilandra.  "You can say anything you like, I don&#039;t mind."</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, chomping on fudge as Hawthorn walked forwards<br />
into the thickening rain.  "Do you want to stop, or shall we keep<br />
on going?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"We can stop here if you like... but it&#039;s all soggy... are there no<br />
little pubs in this area where we can at least mooch by a fireplace and<br />
have hot drinks..." she said, "Cos you&#039;re a lot wetter than I am, so if<br />
we stop I&#039;d have to build you some kind of shelter or you&#039;ll catch a<br />
nasty cold."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, I didn&#039;t see one," said Cain.  "The last time we could see<br />
very far at all was at the top of the last hill, and all we saw from<br />
there was that gingerbread cottage.  Assuming you don&#039;t want to go<br />
back there, we&#039;re either going to have to carry on, or try and shelter<br />
underneath a really thick clump of trees."</p>
<p>Cain looked around, his heart sinking.  It had been raining for<br />
long enough that trees were no longer shelter.  Rather, they had<br />
become merely implements for channelling water as effectively as<br />
possible onto the head of anyone standing under them.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, I&#039;m not going to be too worried either way... how&#039;s your cloak<br />
holding up against the wet?" she asked, noticing the wetness of his<br />
shoulders.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s holding up well enough." he answered.</p>
<p>She dragged his coat out of her bag and put it on.</p>
<p>"Right, with your coat on, I shouldn&#039;t have to shelter under your<br />
cloak... though I&#039;ll miss the hug..." she said. "It shouldn&#039;t take<br />
forever to find a pub... and until then we have fudge, marshmallows and<br />
each other&#039;s company... and it&#039;s not like we haven&#039;t got a constant<br />
supply of drink falling on our heads..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Yeah," said Cain, wrapping his cloak tightly around him as Ilandra pulled away.  "I hope we reach somewhere soon..."</p>
<p>Cain and Ilandra gritted their teeth and rode onwards, while all the time the rain worsened still further.</p>
<p>By the time half an hour had passed, the visibility was so low that<br />
they could barely make out the trees either side of the track that they<br />
were attempting to follow.  And yet they had still not seen any<br />
other building, nor even sign of life, since the cottage...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Right!" Ilandra declared. "I&#039;m getting sick of this whole riding in<br />
the rain malarkey... we can barely see the path now. I say we stop and<br />
I&#039;ll sort some kind of shelter out... least then we can snuggle."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Halt!" came a shout from beside the track, the voice&#039;s owner still<br />
masked by the rain.  As if the point needed emphasising, an arrow<br />
whistled through the air a foot or so in front of Hawthorn&#039;s<br />
head.  The horse stopped, gracefully, as if making the point that<br />
he was only <i>choosing</i> to stop because he felt like it, and could just as well have carried on.</p>
<p>A voice, deep and gruff, seemed to echo inside Ilandra&#039;s head as if she<br />
had been spoken to without the need for such contrivances as mouths and<br />
ears - which was more-or-less the case.</p>
<p>"Shall I?" asked the voice.</p>
<p>"Not yet," whispered Cain, who presumably had heard it too.</p>
<p>The man who had fired the arrow, and who had another notched, stepped<br />
forward so that Ilandra and Cain could make out his form as a slightly<br />
detailed shadow in the mist.  He was stocky but not tall, his<br />
shape matching well the voice they&#039;d heard.  On his signal, three<br />
more people stood forward, blocking the path.  They, too, held<br />
back so that their faces could not easily be made out.</p>
<p>"&#039;Oo goes thar?" asked the gruff voice again.  "An&#039; why ye<br />
travellin&#039; this road?  Answer hones&#039;ly, our bows a&#039; trained<br />
&#039;gainst yer &#039;eads!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"We&#039;re... um... we&#039;re no&#039; important, just two normal, ordinary people<br />
wandering about... and we&#039;re lost." Ilandra declared, trying her very<br />
best to sound common. "You wouldn&#039;t happen to know where the nearest<br />
pub is, would you?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Neares&#039; pub?" asked one of the other men.  "Why, tha&#039;s-"</p>
<p>The first man to have spoken elbowed the other sharply in the ribs.</p>
<p>"Ahem," coughed the presumably authoritarian figure.  "You ain&#039;t from round &#039;ere, are ye?  Where&#039;re ye from?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"We&#039;re from a long way away... we were sent to find Honeysuckle land to<br />
get some medicine for our baron, but well... we got lost." she said,<br />
allowing herself to fall deeper into the lie. "Anyway, we haven&#039;t had<br />
any chance to rest for quite some time and we&#039;d appreciate a warm<br />
fire..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Ooh ar, I don&#039;t know&#039;a any Honeysu&#039;le lan&#039; near &#039;ere though.  You<br />
must be not &#039;alf lost, this is Hy&#039;cinth land.  No&#039; tha&#039; tha&#039;<br />
matters much ri&#039; now."</p>
<p>"Still," he continued, "le&#039;s &#039;ave a look at yer."</p>
<p>He man stepped forward, lowering his bow.  His friends didn&#039;t<br />
move, and continued giving the impression that they were very much<br />
armed.</p>
<p>The man who approached them was middle-aged, with shaggy red hair that<br />
merged into his moustache and beard.  Though, as his silhouette<br />
had belied, he was not the tallest of men the width that he had<br />
instead, which seemed comprised entirely of muscle, more than made up<br />
for it.</p>
<p>He peered up at Ilandra and Cain with piercing blue eyes, half shut against the rain.</p>
<p>Looking them over, the man saw little more than two dishevelled<br />
figures, a bag which might have contained their only possessions, and<br />
an old farm horse that both of them rode for lack of money to buy<br />
another.</p>
<p>"Roight," said the man, signalling his friends.  "You two come wi&#039;<br />
us.  It ain&#039;t tha&#039; close, but ye&#039;ll &#039;ave a fire before tonight."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra perked up at the thought of a fire.</p>
<p>"Ok," she said. <i> not that we have much choice either way...</i></p>
<p>Nervously, she squeezed Cain&#039;s hand and twisted her signet ring around<br />
so it would appear to be a thin band of metal rather than the large<br />
band of metal it normally appeared to be.</p>
<p><i>Best hide my ring in my bag as soon as I can, really...</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain squeezed Ilandra&#039;s hand in return, them both silently expressing their fear to each other.</p>
<p>Their would-be ambushers formed up, two in front of and two behind the<br />
horse - presumably to keep the riders in some form of captive mentality<br />
- and they began to move.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The day had worn on into early afternoon by the time Ilandra and Cain&#039;s<br />
journey consisted of anything other than being escorted through<br />
rain-drenched forest.  Sadly it was not the weather that changed,<br />
but the landscape.  The forest thinned, very slowly, and the land<br />
started to rise until after perhaps two hours they reached end of the<br />
valley.  Spread out before them was what once was undoubtedly<br />
good, productive farmland.  Now, however, most of the fields were<br />
burned and empty; some were still smoking in places.  Hedgerows<br />
lay decimated, and paths torn up by the passage of troops.</p>
<p>Amidst this destruction lay a village, just as damaged as the land<br />
around it.  Where once it may have nestled between rolling fields,<br />
now it just huddled.</p>
<p>It was towards this village, and eventually towards one of the more cohesive houses, that Ilandra and Cain were led.</p>
<p>As they approached the house, the man who appeared the leader strode ahead and knocked upon the door.</p>
<p>"South-East patrol returned, sir!" the man barked.  "Two other folk we found on the road!"</p>
<p>"Roight, send &#039;em in," came a voice from inside that was simultaneously both commanding and ancient.</p>
<p>The leader of the group that had escorted them through the forest turned, and approached their horse.</p>
<p>"You &#039;eard the man," he said.  "Go on insoide.  Don&#039; worry, nowt bad&#039;s gonna &#039;appen."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Tentatively, Ilandra slid from the saddle, allowing herself to be<br />
caught and helped down by Cain. Pulling her bag on and wrapping his<br />
coat tighter around her body she grabbed Cain&#039;s hand, resisting all<br />
urges to kitten up and hide in his cloak at the same time.</p>
<p>The couple walked in through the door.</p>
<p><i>I hope nothing bad does happen...</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Inside, the house was thick with dust and dimly lit through<br />
blanket-covered windows.  At one end of the gloom sat a short,<br />
heavily bearded old man, on what could well have been the village&#039;s<br />
only remaining chair.  His eyes, though, shone with an intensity<br />
of a much younger man.  In fact, so bright - and orange - were<br />
they, that they seemed to be all the light sources that the room<br />
required.</p>
<p>His arm, with attached hand and beckoning finger, reached out towards Ilandra and Cain though the dusty air.</p>
<p>"Come closer, you," the old man said, "an&#039; le&#039;s &#039;ave a look a&#039; yer."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra edged a little closer, her face adopting a nervous expression.</p>
<p><i>I bet he&#039;s just like Grizzel and he&#039;s gonna tell me off for breaking a vase somewhere...</i></p>
<p>She fidgeted a little with a bit of Cain&#039;s coat as the bright orange<br />
eyes focused on her, and subconsciously braced herself for a telling<br />
off.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The old man&#039;s eyes caught Ilandra&#039;s for a brief moment, before his gaze<br />
flicked up and down her.  He repeated the same procedure with<br />
Cain, then glanced back and forth between them a few times.</p>
<p>"Roight," he said, quieter and slightly more suspiciously than before.  "Now who be ye, and how comes it you&#039;re &#039;ere?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra cleared her throat a little before answering in her best peasant accent.</p>
<p>"We&#039;re just or&#039;nery people on our way to find the Honeysuckle lan&#039;s<br />
so&#039;s we can get med&#039;cine for our baron cos &#039;is kid&#039;s ill." she said,<br />
elaborating on her previous lie. "This &#039;ere&#039;s Gerald, &#039;e don&#039;t talk<br />
much." she said indicating Cain.</p>
<p><font color="red">Roll manipulation + subterfuge and got 4 successes.</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"For yer Baron?" the old man asked.  "Tha&#039;s quoite the ded&#039;cation,<br />
ain&#039;t it, Miss..."  He stopped, clearly waiting for Ilandra to<br />
fill in her name.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Kate," she finished for him. "...i&#039;&#039;s not tha&#039; much dedication really,<br />
&#039;e&#039;s allus took good care of us. Speshly when our Betsy stopped<br />
producing milk."</p>
<p>She wandered back and hugged Cain.</p>
<p>"Besides, &#039;e said if we do this right we ge&#039; to be together."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Ge&#039; ta be t&#039;gether?" the old man asked.  "Hahaha, why&#039;d ye need<br />
his p&#039;mission?  Yer yer own people, ya&#039; can be t&#039;gether if ye<br />
likes!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked a little uneasy at the last remark the old man had made.</p>
<p>"I&#039;&#039;s a little complica&#039;ed there..." she said. "But basically, we need<br />
to go through a lot of trouble to stay together." she looked down at<br />
the ground, sadly, not realizing she&#039;d begun to slip out of her peasant<br />
accent half way through the last sentence.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"A lot&#039;a trouble?" asked the man, his eyes narrowing.<br />
"Nonsense!  You&#039;s t&#039;gether here, ain&#039;t ya?  If ye want ta be<br />
t&#039;gether, ya can stay here.  Nobody gonna&#039; touch you here!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra&#039;s eyes widened at the prospect of getting to stay by Cain&#039;s side til they got bored and wandered off.</p>
<p><i>well, it&#039;ll only be for a little while, right?</i></p>
<p>"Really? We can stay here?" she asked, like a little child just handed<br />
a massive bar of candy and told it can keep it. "Tha&#039; would be<br />
amazin&#039;!" she could barely contain her glee at the prospect of keeping<br />
the &#039;candy bar&#039;. "We&#039;ll help ou&#039; in t&#039;fields an&#039; all mister!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, you&#039;d &#039;ave ta pull your weight &#039;round &#039;ere," the man said,<br />
glancing at Cain for a moment before returning to Ilandra.  "You<br />
too, Miss.  We&#039;re on our own out &#039;ere now, nowt ta look after<br />
us.  Well, you musta&#039; seen the fields on the way &#039;ere.<br />
T&#039;ain&#039;t much left of &#039;em, so we&#039;s got a lotta&#039; work ta do."</p>
<p>The man coughed, started to choke, then thumped himself in the chest until he could breathe again.</p>
<p>"Roight then.  Wi&#039; this rain, there&#039;s no sense startin&#039; today, so<br />
you&#039;ll stay &#039;ere for now.  Mi name&#039;s Jebodiah, you already met me&#039;<br />

start work on the fields t&#039;morrer while one&#039;a us build ya a place ta&#039;<br />
stay."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Seeing Jebadiah coughing, Ilandra absent-mindedly rooted around in her<br />
bag and pulled out a little cotton bag of herbs and handed them to him.</p>
<p>"Take some of these, they&#039;re good fer colds." she said, handing them to him. "Yeh&#039;ll be better in no time after."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Jebodiah gingerly took the pouch from Ilandra, opened it, and peered<br />
inside.  His gaze slowly rose to meet hers.  If it were<br />
possible, his eyes seemed even wider and more shining than normal.</p>
<p>"You... know about herbs?" he asked.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"A little, I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m not good wi&#039; serious stuff but if i&#039;&#039;s<br />
something minor like a cold or a tummy bug I&#039;m ok." she said, not fully<br />
aware of the significance of this knowledge.</p>
<p>"Roihgt, roight," said Jebodiah.  "Yes, well, Oi&#039;ve...  Oi&#039;ve<br />
got a bit of an errand to run," he said, standing up and hobbling his<br />
way towards the door.  "You two hold tight here, an&#039; Oi&#039;ll be back<br />
afore long."</p>
<p>As he left the room Ilandra pulled Cain down to her height and kissed him.</p>
<p>"How much do you know about farming, my dear?" she asked, wrapping her arms around him.</p>
<p>"Er, well..." Cain said, "I&#039;ve, um, seen farmers at work.  You<br />
know, doing...  Things.  In fields, with horses and um,<br />
ploughs?"</p>
<p>Ilandra&#039;s heart melted a lot and she had to stop herself from ruffling his hair and calling him adorable...</p>
<p>"Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ll try and teach you the basics... hopefully they&#039;ll<br />
have a working plough in which case all you have to do is guide the d-<br />
horse in a straight line..." she said. "I keep forgetting how little<br />
you spent outside... good thing you&#039;ve got me then..." giggling a<br />
little she buried her face in his chest and tightened the hug.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Roight, sorry Oi took so long!" said Jebodiah as he returned, 10<br />
minutes or so later.  "Kate, would ya come wi&#039; me?  Yer man<br />
can come too, if &#039;e loikes."</p>
<p>Ilandra and Cain followed the old man from his house and along the<br />
village&#039;s only track-like street.  The few inhabitants that showed<br />
their faces all stared intently at Ilandra, with one part suspicion to<br />
three parts wonder.</p>
<p>At the far end of the village, some way separated from the other<br />
buildings, stood a house that bar its position was indistinguishable<br />
from the others.  It was to this house that Jebodiah led them.</p>
<p>The smell hit them before they had even gone within ten feet of the<br />
front door.  A very distinct smell that was no stranger to any of<br />
the three.</p>
<p>When the old man opened the front door and led them in, the sight<br />
before them was as shocking as it was unsurprising.  The house was<br />
one large room, in which lay eight straw mattresses.  All but one<br />
was occupied with peasants in varying stages of consciousness and<br />
coherence, all suffering from battle wounds, most of them suffering<br />
more from the after-effects of lack of treatment than from the injuries<br />
themselves.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra&#039;s brain snapped straight into nurse-mode and she rooted in her<br />
bag for her overalls. Having found them she put them on and turned to<br />
Jebodiah.</p>
<p>"Where&#039;s the nearest well? I&#039;m going to need water for these men." she<br />
half demanded, half asked. He answered her and she told them both to<br />
get her at least two buckets of fresh water.</p>
<p>Cracking her knuckles she set about looking at the first man who had<br />
quite deep sword wounds which looked like they were in dire need of<br />
being cleaned and bandaged. She sighed and pulled out her only other<br />
dress which she proceeded to cut into strips using her scissors.</p>
<p>"So much for a change of clothes when we reach our destination. I guess<br />
I&#039;ll have to borrow another shirt." she said to herself as she cut the<br />
dress into strips. "I wonder if these people even know that we exist to<br />
help them too. Well, I&#039;ll just have to do my best and hope..." <i>and if any of them get any worse I&#039;ll have to take the risk and get more help for them...</i></p>
<p>The man seemed to hear her and moaned as he tried to turn towards her.</p>
<p>"Stay still, sir. It&#039;ll only get worse... I&#039;m going to get those wounds<br />
cleaned out for you and then I&#039;ll bandage you up. You&#039;ll see, you&#039;ll be<br />
good as new in no time." she told him, patting his hand and smiling<br />
sweetly at him in what she hoped was a reassuring manner. "Is there<br />
anything you need? I can get my partner to get it for you if you<br />
like... he&#039;ll be back soon."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Water..." the man gasped, and right on cue Cain and Jebodiah crashed through the door carrying two buckets each.</p>
<p>The wounded man&#039;s forehead was burning hot, and was sweating<br />
profusely.  Casting her eyes around the room, Ilandra noticed a<br />
number of the patients in a similar condition, most of whom were<br />
tossing and turning in restless sleep.</p>
<p><font color="red">OC: Int + Medicine, difficulty 5, gogogo</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p><font color="red">Roll int + medicine 1 success</font></p>
<p>Ilandra grabbed one of the buckets and started looking around for a<br />
glass for the guy. Then she thought better of it and expanded her<br />
search to make it a glass each for the patients.</p>
<p>"Can I keep Gerald here to help?" she asked Jebodiah. "I don&#039;t know how<br />
skilled anyone else is and at the moment it looks like the men just<br />
need their wounds cleaned and cold compresses. We also need some kind<br />
of drinking thing, a flagon perhaps, for each man. So I&#039;d be grateful<br />
for that." she handed Cain some strips of what could still be<br />
identified as one of her favourite dresses. "Dip these in water and<br />
stick them on the foreheads of each patient."</p>
<p>She then dipped a strip of dress in the bucket and handed it to the man she&#039;d been sitting next to.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s not a cup of water, but it&#039;ll have to do for now... I can&#039;t give<br />
you the whole bucket after all." she told him, trying to keep her voice<br />
as lighthearted as possible. "However, if you give me a few minutes I<br />
can get you a cup or something and you can drink from that."</p>
<p>"Righty, is there a pub or something nearby where I might be able to<br />
bribe the landlord into lending me some flagons?" she asked Jebodiah,<br />
no longer caring whether she kept up the peasant accent or not.</p>
<p><i>hell, the way I see it our house is apparently the closest to<br />
peasanty that they&#039;ll still invite to parties and our peasants speak<br />
like i do...</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The injured man in front of Ilandra smiled weakly when the subject of water was mentioned.</p>
<p>"Pub, yeah," said Jebodiah.  "We&#039;s go&#039; a pub &#039;right.  Ain&#039;t<br />
got a lan&#039;lord no more, tho&#039;.  If ya need Gerald &#039;ere, Oi&#039;ll run<br />
an&#039; ge&#039; ya flag&#039;ns or sommat."</p>
<p>Jebodiah, true to his word, left the house at a run, leaving Ilandra<br />
and Cain alone for a moment with seven patients in varying states of,<br />
well, death.</p>
<p>Barely a minute later, a flustered and drenched Jebodiah clattered<br />
through the door again, five badly-made but serviceable jugs and<br />
tankards in each hand.  He put them down on the patient&#039;s bed and<br />
bent double, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>"Here y- <i>wheeze</i> are, Kate."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Seeing the old man so flustered, Ilandra thanked him and ushered him to a chair.</p>
<p>"You&#039;d better rest so that you don&#039;t get ill..." she told him, then<br />
half-filled a flagon with water and handed it to the first patient.</p>
<p>She asked him if he had any wounds between his belly and knee. He nodded. Plucking up some extra resolve she called Cain over.</p>
<p>"He, er, you&#039;ll have to clean and bandage a few of the wounds for<br />
me..." she told him, pinkening slightly. Then turning to the man,<br />
"Right, Gerald here will deal with those wounds. So, erm, I&#039;m going to<br />
see if I can&#039;t find some kind of curtain or something... Don&#039;t worry<br />
though, he&#039;s very gentle..."</p>
<p>In a mild panic, Ilandra looked around in search of cloths which could<br />
be made into some kind of screen. She found one in the corner and<br />
picked up a broom. She went over to the bed and hitched the fabric on a<br />
jutting nail then tied the other end around the broom and stuck the<br />
broom bristles up in the corner of the bed between the mattress and<br />
frame. With her rudimentary screen set up, she picked up a few clean<br />
strips of dress and a bucket of water and moved on to the next man.</p>
<p>"Hello, are you thirsty?" she asked, grabbing a flagon and half filling<br />
it with water. She put the flagon down by the bed and took a cursory<br />
glance at his torso which was criss-crossed with sword wounds. Dipping<br />
a strip of fabric into the water she started on the biggest gouge,<br />
ensuring that the dirt drained out of the cut. When most of the cuts<br />
were clean she started bandaging them with strips of dress. "Well, that<br />
should keep you going for a little while... let&#039;s see how your fever&#039;s<br />
doing..." she put her hand to his forehead which was quite warm. "Ok,<br />
I&#039;m probably going to be needing a lot of feverfew, huh?" she said to<br />
herself. "That can wait till tomorrow, for now I should just make sure<br />
the cuts are clean."</p>
<p>So saying she moved on to the next patient where she repeated the<br />
procedures. Every once in a while sending Jebodiah or Cain out for a<br />
fresh bucket of water.</p>
<p><font color="red">OC: i would bother including that she cleans every<br />
