<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>An hour or so later, Ilandra and Cain had mostly made up.  Ilandra<br />
had promised to tell Cain in future if she wanted to go off on her own,<br />
and given him spare keys so that he couldn&#039;t be locked up anywhere in<br />
her house.  Cain had ceased moping, and the two of them were<br />
more-or-less back to their normal selves.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Having curled up on the couch next to Cain after they made up, Ilandra<br />
was getting progressively more restless. Eventually she looked up at<br />
him, trying to gauge how receptive he&#039;d be to any new adventures.<br />
Deciding that she didn&#039;t care, she took a breath and steeled herself<br />
for a negative answer.</p>
<p>"Cain, do you want to come to the village with me? I sort of wanted to<br />
go see the inn keeper&#039;s daughter..." she said. "Because I haven&#039;t seen<br />
Alison in weeks and she&#039;ll want to gossip..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain looked confused.  "Do you really need me for that?" he<br />
asked.  "Gossip isn&#039;t, you know... it&#039;s not really my kind of<br />
thing."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I wasn&#039;t just going for gossip... I sorta wanted to make it a date...<br />
but say hi to a friend while I was at it..." she said, blushing bright<br />
red. "I don&#039;t know what really qualifies as dating..." <i>so I was going to ask Alison...</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, okay then," said Cain.  "To be honest, I&#039;m not too sure<br />
about it either.  I assumed there was something between the having<br />
a politically beneficial wife selected for you and actually marrying<br />
the woman, but we were never taught quite what..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Oh." Ilandra said, "Well, we could ask Alison... she&#039;s been on lots of<br />
dates... She&#039;s always telling me about these things so I was mostly<br />
going to get an idea or two... though she suggested that usually on<br />
dates the man pays for everything... which confuses me somewhat, mostly<br />
because I never have to pay for anything around here anyway..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Yes, paying for things does sound rather more like a peasant&#039;s<br />
date.  Still, I suppose we&#039;ll work something out.  You could<br />
come over to Poppy sometime for a date, then I suppose it&#039;d sort of be<br />
me paying for it."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"That sounds fair, I suppose. In which case, let me take you out<br />
tonight and then you can take me out some other day..." she said, not<br />
quite meeting his eyes as she went crimson again. After a few seconds<br />
she looked back up at him and smiled, "Besides, I owe it to you<br />
really... it&#039;s the least I could do..."</p>
<p>She got up and extended a hand to him, in a mock-gentlemanly pose, a<br />
mischievous smile on her face. As he took her hand, she giggled<br />
nervously and pulled him towards her and inexpertly tried to lean him<br />
back like they do in a tango. Unfortunately, her romantic gesture<br />
backfired as she dropped him. Dissolving into nervous giggles, she<br />
joined him on the floor.</p>
<p>"Well, I tried..." she giggled.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Yeah," said Cain, grabbing Ilandra and rolling them over and over until they hit a wall and disengaged, still laughing.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, their giggling slowly subsided.</p>
<p>"So then," said Cain.  "The pub?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Yup! The pub!" she chirped, then kissed him and got up. "Come on then, last one to the door is a rotten egg!"</p>
<p>She started running towards the door, giggling as Cain followed. As he<br />
caught up, he swept her up and spun her round. She giggled more,<br />
putting up a mock protest. As they reached the front door he put her<br />
down to get his boots back on. She stuck her feet in her shoes and<br />
pulled him out of the door playfully, only waiting until he&#039;d tied one<br />
boot up. As they tumbled down the lane towards the village, pausing<br />
briefly to allow the other boot to be tied, Ilandra was trying to work<br />
out what would constitute a date that they&#039;d both enjoy.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>As they entered the pub, the people inside turned to look at them going<br />
quiet when they saw Cain. Ilandra waved a quick greeting, turning back<br />
to Cain and grabbing his hand. She gently guided him towards the bar<br />
where the barmaid watched him intently.</p>
<p>"Hello, your grace..." she said, keeping an eye on Cain. "I assume you and your guest would like a table out of the way?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, also is Alison about? I need some advice from her..." she asked, fidgeting with a loose thread on her jacket.</p>
<p>"Sure, I&#039;ll go get her. Just wait over there and she&#039;ll be right out."</p>
<p>Ilandra nodded and sat down with Cain at a table in the corner, aware that half the pub was still watching them.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"So," Cain whispered.  "I can&#039;t help noticing a certain amount of... suspicion in here.  I&#039;m guessing it <i>is</i> less dangerous than the last pub in Wheat Down, right?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Hold on, I&#039;ll make them stop staring. They&#039;re just not used to seeing<br />
me with anyone." she whispered back. Standing up, she walked back to<br />
the bar and called the landlord over. After a brief exchange he turned<br />
to the rest of the bar, ringing the last order bell for their attention.</p>
<p>"Right, you lot! Little Ilandra wants us to stop staring at her man and<br />
said she&#039;ll pay for all the drinks tonight if they get left to it...<br />
also, if I catch any of you staring I&#039;ll kick you out." he told them,<br />
turning back to Ilandra to check he&#039;d done the right thing. Turning<br />
slightly red, she nodded and held her thumbs up at him before<br />
sheepishly returning to her table.</p>
<p>"That should fix it." she told him, wishing she were slightly less embarrassed.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain sighed, and thanked Ilandra.  "Well," he said, "I suppose<br />
that&#039;s the peace and quiet sorted.  But didn&#039;t you want to talk to<br />
one of them?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Yeah, she&#039;s just coming..." Ilandra pointed out a girl who looked<br />
about 19 walking towards them. As the girl approached she looked at<br />
Cain and Ilandra in surprise before laughing out loud.</p>
<p>"Ilandra! I haven&#039;t seen you in ages and now you turn up needing advice<br />
so I assume it&#039;s for help with that guy you spent two years moping<br />
about and I find you with this gorgeous bloke!" she said incredulously.<br />
"I&#039;m Alison, by the way... Might you be Cain or is that too much to<br />
hope for?"</p>
<p>Ilandra glared at her friend. "I would kill you if I didn&#039;t need your advice." she growled quietly.</p>
<p>"Ilandra, you wouldn&#039;t... you&#039;ve threatened once a week every week for two years..." Alison murmured back.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain, busily looking back and forth between Ilandra and Alison as they<br />
bantered, took a few moments to realise that they&#039;d stopped and thus<br />
that it was probably his turn to say something.</p>
<p>"Oh, uh..." he began.  I&#039;m Cain, yes.  Er, Prince Cain, of House Poppy.  How do you do?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m alright." she said, grinning salaciously. "So, what did you want my advice for? You got the guy."</p>
<p>"Yeah, er... don&#039;t laugh. What counts as a date?" Ilandra asked, pulling out a pen and paper.</p>
<p>Alison bit back a laugh, giving Cain a look of pity.</p>
<p>"Dates depend on the couple. It could be going out for a meal and the<br />
guy taking care of the bill or having a picnic somewhere. What kind of<br />
thing did you have in mind?"</p>
<p>"Er... dinner?" Ilandra asked, looking at Cain. Then she buried her<br />
face in her hands and lamented. "I have no idea... I just want to do<br />
something nice." Pulling herself back together she asked Cain what he<br />
wanted to do.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, a meal wouldn&#039;t be half bad.  To tell the truth, I&#039;m<br />
somewhat famished.  But I can&#039;t really pay for things here, all of<br />
it&#039;s yours already!  I mean... it&#039;s probably okay if you &#039;pay&#039;<br />
instead of me today.  And we could always go for a picnic<br />
tomorrow?  Hopefully somewhere nice, without any armies."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Right... Is the kitchen still open?" she asked Alison, who nodded and<br />
told her she was the cook that night. "Well, if Alison&#039;s cooking I<br />
guess the food is safe to eat... What would you like?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I, er..." Cain faltered.  "Um, I&#039;ve never really eaten in a place<br />
quite like this is before," he whispered to Ilandra.  "What do<br />
they serve?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra shrugged.</p>
<p>"Ice cream, mostly... I think..." she whispered back. "You want me to find out?"</p>
<p>Cain nodded.</p>
<p>"Alison... what kind of food do you serve that isn&#039;t... you know... Ice cream or cookies?" Ilandra asked.</p>
<p>"Well, tonight&#039;s special is venison fillet steak with potatoes." Alison<br />
said, smiling understandingly. She turned to Cain sympathetically.<br />
"Ilandra generally depletes our stores of ice cream... but we do serve<br />
normal food. I strongly recommend the venison though."</p>
<p>Ilandra fidgeted with a strand of hair as Alison spoke, looking up once she&#039;d finished.</p>
<p>"Also, could I have some scrumpy instead of milk? Scrumpy tastes like mice..." she asked, chewing her lip.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Alison burst out laughing, then reverted to a mischievous grin.</p>
<p>"Scrumpy, eh?" she asked.  "You spent &#039;ow long with the Poppies, and now your boozing?  And <i>scrumpy</i>, of all things?"  Another chuckle.  "Well, not like I can tell ya&#039; off.  Scrumpy it is!"</p>
<p>"And, um...  Venison please," said Cain weakly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;ll have you know, I was shown the wonders of scrumpy in Hyacinth<br />
land... though that&#039;s now Poppy..." she trailed off. "Least it&#039;s not<br />
moonshine." she crossed her arms obstinately.</p>
<p>Alison&#039;s eyes fairly boggled.</p>
<p>"You got given MOONSHINE?!?" she sputtered. "Good lord! What&#039;s the world coming to when they give moonshine to young girls?"</p>
<p>Without waiting for an answer she turned and returned to the kitchens,<br />
shaking her head in disbelief and muttering about how the world was<br />
changing.</p>
<p>Ilandra looked apologetically at Cain.</p>
<p>"She gets a bit... much... sometimes." she explained, shrugging<br />
slightly. "Did you want a drink? I&#039;ll get her to bring you something<br />
when she comes back..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Just water or something, please.  I can&#039;t say that scrumpy and moonshine really appeal at this point..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra nodded.</p>
<p>"You sure you don&#039;t want fruit juice instead? I really don&#039;t mind either way..." she said, fidgeting with her signet ring.</p>
<p>He shrugged, indicating his ambivalence. Ilandra reached over and took<br />
his hand, feeling that she was somehow failing at dating unless she<br />
showed him a little of how she felt but let go of it as her nerves<br />
failed her. The ensuing awkwardness was immediately interrupted by the<br />
barmaid bringing Ilandra her drink.</p>
<p>"Would you like your usual when we bring his food or do you want it now?" she asked.<br />
"I&#039;ll wait, thanks." Ilandra replied. "Also, could you bring Cain a<br />
drink? Preferably non-alcoholic... Also, have you been allowed to try<br />
moonshine yet?"<br />
"You know I haven&#039;t. My dad would never allow it... I am curious<br />
though." Alison replied, sneaking a look at the bottle behind the bar.<br />
"Fair enough..." Ilandra replied, mischief beginning to sparkle in her eyes. "I could arrange something if you like..."<br />
"Ilandra, you&#039;ll be the death of me someday..." Alison laughed. "...anyway, I&#039;m off to fetch his Highness a drink."</p>
<p>Alison disappeared off behind the bar to get Cain a drink, returning a<br />
few seconds later with a glass of kumquat smoothie which she placed<br />
before Cain. Excusing herself she returned to the kitchen, returning<br />
with a plate of venison for Cain and a bowl of ice cream with cookies.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Looking around, Ilandra made sure nobody was watching her so she took a<br />
sip from her glass to soothe her nerves and shuffled her chair closer<br />
to Cain, taking his hand again. Looking up into his eyes, she lifted<br />
his hand to her lips and kissed it then returned it to the table.<br />
Despite the alcohol, she was still quite nervous and she could feel her<br />
cheeks burning in a fierce blush.</p>
<p>"I hope you like the food..." she said, looking slightly away from his<br />
face as shyness threatened to overcome her. Reaching over, she brought<br />
her food closer to where she was now sitting. Quietly, she began to eat<br />
her ice cream enjoying the contrast between the coolness of the ice<br />
cream and the warm and crunchiness of the cookies.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"So," said Cain once the two of them had got partway through their<br />
meal.  "We&#039;ve got, er..."  He reverted to a whisper.<br />
"We&#039;ve got the two Rose dukes and their cohorts coming to the wedding,<br />
but what about the others?  If nothing else, we at least need to<br />
invite the rest of the Poppies and the Honeysuckles."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Try not to tell anyone about it until your mother knows and everything<br />
will turn out just fine." she told him. "Especially not my butler."</p>
<p>A passing woman turned and approached their table.</p>
<p>"What aren&#039;t you telling Catkin now?" she asked Ilandra.</p>
<p>"Nothing he needs to know yet." Ilandra replied.</p>
<p>"Really?" she turned to Cain. "Listen, our duchess is always getting<br />
Catkin into the most bizarre situations and I&#039;m sure he&#039;d totally<br />
appreciate it if you got on his good side... after all, aren&#039;t you<br />
engaged? He&#039;ll be your butler soon..." the woman&#039;s eyes widened<br />
imperceptibly. "Unless you have a date! Do you have a date for it?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Of course not!" said Cain, his mock incredulity masking the lie.<br />
"We&#039;ve only been engaged four days, give us a chance!  No," he<br />
said, calming down, "it&#039;s more of a political matter.  I just<br />
don&#039;t want any official Honeysuckle involvement unless my mother okays<br />
it, and I particularly don&#039;t want anyone such as Catkin taking anything<br />
into their own hands and making things worse by trying to help."</p>
<p>"Sorry," he said with a smile.  "No gossip here yet!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra giggled, surprised that Cain had thrown her off the trail. She looked at the woman, smiling.</p>
<p>"Told you so!" she said, smiling broadly. The woman seemed completely<br />
satisfied with the couple&#039;s replies and continued on her way to<br />
wherever she was going. As soon as she was out of earshot, Ilandra<br />
breathed a sigh of relief. "Good grief, just as well you pulled that<br />
off... she&#039;s Catkin&#039;s best friend."</p>
<p>Looking up at him happily, she pulled him down to her level and kissed him.</p>
<p>"So, what else would you like to do?" she asked him, smiling mischievously at him.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Um...  I don&#039;t know," said Cain.  "What is there to do?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, we could go for a walk..." she said, blushing bright red. "Or er... maybe... erm..."</p>
<p>She trailed off, as the sheer force of her blush began to make her feel<br />
a little light-headed. Grabbing her drink she took another swig, to<br />
settle her nerves a little, and hiccuped.</p>
<p>"Let&#039;s see... at this time of night there&#039;s not very much to do other<br />
than either socialise with the people or wander around or read..." she<br />
said, still blushing a little. "Sorry..." she smiled weakly, trying not<br />
to make eye contact with anybody least of all Cain.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I don&#039;t really...  I mean, I&#039;m not really used to socialising<br />
with peasants," Cain whispered.  "It&#039;s more your sort of thing<br />
than mine.  And you look a bit... you know, like that scrumpy went<br />
to your head."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Somehow Ilandra&#039;s blush deepened, leaving her almost glowing in her chair.<br />
<i>I hope no-one notices</i><br />
She was jolted into further embarrassment by Alison coming to take her plate away.<br />
"Ilandra... you realise you&#039;re going to end up burning the pub down<br />
with that blush... what kind of filth were you thinking about now?" she<br />
asked, laughing.<br />
"I wasn&#039;t...!" Ilandra protested. "I am now! Ohgoodgriefcainisrighthereandicantstopblushing!"</p>
<p>The embarrassment suddenly got too much for Ilandra and she dissolved<br />
into cat form. Alison shook her head and picked up Ilandra&#039;s empty<br />
plate.<br />
"You know, I&#039;d almost say that the scrumpy went to your head... but I<br />
know you too well..." she said, turning back to the kitchen and<br />
carrying the bowl away. "I&#039;ll be back with some more ice cream and<br />
juice."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain set about idly scratching Ilandra behind the ears until Alison returned with the promised food and drink.</p>
<p>"Sorry," he said meekly to the waitress.</p>
<p>Alison chuckled.  "It&#039;s okay.  She&#039;s fun to tease!"</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Cain, smiling back at her.  His smile turned into a<br />
wistful gaze into the middle-distance as she headed back to the bar.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra moved from her seat onto Cain&#039;s lap, purring as he continued<br />
scratching behind her ears. After a few minutes she could feel the<br />
initial embarrassment disappear and decided it&#039;d probably be safe to<br />
revert back to her fae form so she did, neglecting to move off Cain&#039;s<br />
lap. Once she&#039;d regained her usual shape, she realised she was still on<br />
his lap and blushed slightly then scooched back onto her chair.<br />
She looked around to make sure nobody was watching her, satisfied that nobody was.</p>
<p>"so... fresh air?" she asked, fidgeting slightly with her spoon.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Sure," he said, and the two of them made to leave.  From behind the bar, Alison winked at them both.</p>
<p>"Down to the river?" Cain asked as the two of them stepped outside into the faintly moonlit darkness.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"yeah, ok." Ilandra said, taking Cain&#039;s hand and allowing him to set the pace at which they walked.</p>
<p>The air was refreshing and cool, like an early spring evening, and<br />
Ilandra wished that she had put on a cardigan before they&#039;d left.<br />
Letting go of Cain&#039;s hand she moved slightly towards him, putting an<br />
arm around him to better share his warmth.</p>
<p>"I hope you&#039;re enjoying yourself..." she said, earnestly. "because I am... I like spending time with you..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Yeah," he said faintly as the two of them wound down the path to the<br />
river.  Without another word, the two of them seated themselves on<br />
the trunk of a tree that jutted out over the still water.  In the<br />
heavens above a crescent moon shone and was echoed by a thousand<br />
glittering stars, each of which in turn was reflected up at them by the<br />
mirror-like surface of the stream.</p>
<p>Cain looked down for a while, then sighed happily and began to stare upwards at the real stars instead.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s all been... quite a rush, hasn&#039;t it?" he asked.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"It has." she agreed, leaning on him contentedly. "It almost feels<br />
weird to be here like this, just not doing very much... Do you actually<br />
mind everything being so manic?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I...  I don&#039;t know, really," said Cain.  "The last two years<br />
have been really hectic, so I was sort of looking forward to everything<br />
being calm again once we got home.  But then it was me that<br />
proposed to you, and that happened kind of fast, and...  I guess<br />
it&#039;s okay, though, really.  I think.  Are you okay with it?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I haven&#039;t thought about it yet..." she said, looking fixedly at a<br />
point in the middle distance. "On one hand... I kinda well..." she<br />
blushed, glad that the night made her blush harder to see. "When you<br />
went away I was hoping that some day this would eventually happen...<br />
but I didn&#039;t expect it to be so soon and then when it came to asking<br />
the rose dukes my mind raced ahead of itself and well... I&#039;m trying not<br />
to think about it..."</p>
<p>She shrugged, as if words wouldn&#039;t explain the way she felt adequately enough.</p>
<p>"Either way, I&#039;m not massively looking forward to telling your mum..." she admitted.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"It&#039;s all right, I&#039;ll tell her," said Cain.  "You just hang around<br />
out of sight and out of... blast radius.  We ought to tell her<br />
tomorrow, though.  The longer we leave it, the angrier she&#039;ll<br />
pretend to be.  I guess from here on it&#039;s going to be quick<br />
whether we like it or not..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra thought for a few seconds, agreeing with Cain.</p>
<p>"...Why would there be a blast radius?" she asked. "Will she really be angry?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"It&#039;s my mother, I&#039;m sure she&#039;ll find something to be angry<br />
about.  We told her too soon, we left it too late, it&#039;s too fast,<br />
it&#039;s not fast enough, we didn&#039;t consult her, she hasn&#039;t had enough<br />
chocolate recently..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Perhaps we ought to take her some chocolate..." Ilandra mused. "You<br />
know, your mother is the scariest thing in all of Arcadia... still, if<br />
you bribe her with enough chocolate she&#039;s not too bad..."</p>
<p>Ilandra trailed off, letting out a barely stifled yawn.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Mmm," said Cain, "I guess we&#039;ll have to pick some up from the kitchens<br />
tomorrow.  You look tired, shall we go to bed for tonight?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"That sounds like a fantastic idea." she said, jumping down from the<br />
log. She smiled sleepily at Cain. "It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve slept<br />
in my own bed..."</p>
<p>She took his hand and together they walked back to the cottage.</p>
