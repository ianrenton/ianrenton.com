There has been no progress on the tank itself this week, but for the sake of completeness, here's the slides from my talk yesterday at [BarCamp Bournemouth](http://barcampbournemouth.org/). Sadly (thankfully?) I didn't record any audio, so you'll have to cope without the joy of listening to me attempting humour.

The room was so packed that someone elected to watch sat on the floor outside, which is always a good sign. The tank suffered performance anxiety and crapped out after a few minutes of autonomous operation, was controlled at least once by an audience member, and still--somehow--didn't shoot me during the talk.

And of course, everyone understood perfectly what was going on:

All in all, an awesome weekend. Thanks to everyone who attended my talk!
