At long last, my Raspberry Pi has arrived!  Two hours late when ordering appears to translate to two months late to receive the Pi itself, so it's now just one of the thousands of these devices now in the hands of the nation's geeks.

Well.  It's a Raspberry Pi. It boots. Whoopee.

Of course, no computer would be useful without a few accessories.  So naturally I spent nearly the cost of the Pi itself again on a power adapter, HDMI cable and SD card.

Oh yes.  And a few quid more on one extra accessory.

Because what computer is complete without a radio-controlled, BB-firing 1:16 scale replica Mk. I Tiger tank?

Exactly.

Welcome to the Raspberry Tank build diary.
