<p><b>Brief Summary</b></p>
<p>One of Tsuki&#039;s friends in Arcadia.</p>
<p><b>Marea&#039;s Past</b></p>
<p>From as early as she remembers, she, her brother Kalari, and friend Tsuki, have been inseperable. Her childhood, although nearly over, bears nothing but happy memories for her.</p>
<p>Coming from a family where musical talent runs in the blood, Marea has a beautiful singing voice, which frequently gets used.</p>
<p>When, or possibly if, she ever grows up, she&#039;d like to travel the world, entertaining people.</p>
<p>At the start of the story she is 16 years old. She is fairly good-looking, a surprising fact since the last few hundred years have conspired to make the people of the Alseid Plains hardy and tough rather than beautiful. </p>
