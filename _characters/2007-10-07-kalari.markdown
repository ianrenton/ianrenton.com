<p><b>Brief Summary</b></p>
<p>One of Tsuki&#039;s friends from Arcadia.</p>
<p><b>Kalari&#039;s Past</b></p>
<p>Kalari, his sister Marea, and Tsuki all shared pretty much the same childhood, growing up in Arcadia. Kalari is probably the least adventurous of the three, but still wouldn&#039;t think for a second of being left out of any escapades.</p>
<p>He is a year younger than Marea, and two years younger than Tsuki.</p>
<p>His family has a reputation for musical gift, and Kalari is a particularly skilled flautist. His flute is his most prized possession, and rightly so, for such a rare item cost his family most of a year&#039;s earnings. His music is frequently the backdrop to Tsuki&#039;s sword dancing.</p>
<p>He takes pride in his appearance, although his generic rugged-looking Arcadian features still show through. His is 15 years of age at the start of the story. </p>
