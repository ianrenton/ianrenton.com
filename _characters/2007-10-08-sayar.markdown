<h2>Sayar&#039;s Personality</h2>
<p>Maybe she has a heart desperately seeking to be loved, but it seems locked away by her thoughtless mind... </p>
<h2>Sayar&#039;s Past</h2>
<p>Perhaps a spoilt but unloved child, she seems to be a wanderer with little practical knowledge and even less concern for herself and others. </p>
<h2>Sayar&#039;s Card</h2>
<p>Sayar&#039;s card, The Fool, is card 0 of the Major Arcana in what people tend to recognise as a "standard" Tarot deck. This card pretty accurately reflects Sayar&#039;s naivete and almost uncaring attitude. </p>
<h2>Author&#039;s Notes</h2>
<p>Sayar used to be called Sarah, but this was changed in an attempt to reduce the number of Dreaming Awake characters who had such common names that they looked oddly out of place in a fantasy setting.<br />
Sayar (or Sarah, rather) used to be a money-obsessed adventurer, often embarking on &#039;quests&#039; and then charging people for her services after the event. She did, however, have a deeper side, but one that was particularly hard to unearth... A lot of her personality and attitude reminded me of Tamahome from the anime and manga series "Fushigi Yuugi".<br />
The attitude she now has is rather different. In fact, I&#039;m wondering if the natural response of the reader might be to dislike Sayar - something I might have to correct, since that&#039;s certainly not my intention...</p>
