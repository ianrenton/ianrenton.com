<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This town, for me, is peace. It&#039;s escape. And those things are rare indeed when you live a life like mine. In theory it is home, although these days I only get to visit a few times a year – I&#039;m far too busy in my City.</p>
<p>My role in life is not exactly what people expect when they meet me. A smart, be-suited exterior says many things – manager, maybe, or secretary in a particularly big company. What it doesn&#039;t say is “I&#039;m with the Mob.” But that&#039;s who I am.</p>
<p>My name is Maria Jennifer Rosaria, eldest daughter of the London Mafia. I often handle the business for dad while he&#039;s distracted with his own pursuits, or off on business somewhere else. At least for now I&#039;m fine with that, but in the back of my mind I know I&#039;m itching for more. More responsibility! More power!</p>
<p>He&#039;d never accept me, though, he&#039;ll never choose me as his successor, all because of my sex and that damn Code! Still, I&#039;ll find a way. I&#039;ll tear the Code into a thousand pieces if I have to.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Why do I want to be in charge? It&#039;s simple – altruistic even. People are stupid. They can&#039;t always be left to their own devices – they need looking after, they need protecting, they need someone in charge who cares for them.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Woman or not, I&#039;m the best man for the job.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It&#039;s nice to relax here. The place reminds me of my school days – quiet, isolated, and all paid for by the family&#039;s fortune. I don&#039;t like staying here for long, though. While here, all I ever do is talk and cook and occasionally sew or practice my fencing, just things to pass the time.</p>
<p>After a few days, I long to go back to London&#039;s gritty underworld, a place of thick darkness and shady deals and violence. That&#039;s not to say that I especially like doing shady deals or hurting people, but at least it feels real. This place is all white-painted architecture and stylish flowerbeds – artificial, all of it. There&#039;s something much more real about suitcases switched in car parks and knives to the throat.</p>
