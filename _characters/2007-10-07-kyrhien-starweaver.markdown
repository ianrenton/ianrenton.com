<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div>
<p>"Me?  I&#039;m just a traveller," I say.  "I know that won&#039;t exactly satisfy your curiosity, but that&#039;s all there is to say.  I travel, one city to the next.  Yes, there&#039;s a reason.  No, I don&#039;t have a home to go to."</p>
<p>I pause, there, because I do have a home of sorts - it&#039;s just that I&#039;m not welcome there.  Not anymore.  But that&#039;ll change some day.  I want to go home more than anything else, of course I do, but I don&#039;t know how just yet.  There&#039;ll be a way.</p>
<p>So for now, I drift, hoping that someday I&#039;ll find that way and I&#039;ll return to the world where I belong.  There&#039;s no rush, though.  I have all the time in the world.</p>
