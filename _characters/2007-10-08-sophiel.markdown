<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div>
<p>How long has it been?  Truth be told, I&#039;ve lost track.  Centuries, at least.  Probably millennia.  I&#039;ve almost, but not quite forgotten about it.  The day I saw what the future held, the day I was found out, the way He looked at me...</p>
<p>Still, I&#039;m here now.  The thought of returning still circulates around my mind, as does the thought of opposing Him.  I suppose, without realising it at the time, I really did Fall.</p>
<p>But more imminent things keep me busy from day to day.  Cigarettes, coffee.  Research, theology mainly.  And other things, too - things where it&#039;s damn handy to be immortal and not to be in a rush.  It ain&#039;t as if I&#039;ve got to fit as much as I can in eighty years.</p>
<p>But lately, something&#039;s been unusual.  A sort of tense feeling in the air, like something&#039;s happening.  Could it be the End?  The whacked-out Evangelicals and the hippies are prophecying it, but haven&#039;t they always?  No, I don&#039;t know what&#039;s happening, even if anything&#039;s happening - it ain&#039;t as if He keeps me in the loop anymore, y&#039;know?  But I feel like I ought to be... ready.  For something, anything.  Something more than cigarettes, railway bridges and rainy Tuesday afternoons.</p>
