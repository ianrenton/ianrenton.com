This page collates information on running tabletop ('pen-and-paper') roleplaying games in the Dreaming Awake setting.
<h4>Fluff</h4>

<h4>System</h4>
Dreaming Awake games are suggested to use the modified version of White Wolf's New World of Darkness system that is detailed on the following pages:
<ul><li><a href="../da-tabletop-character-creation">Character Creation</a></li>
<li><a href="../da-tabletop-system">System / Rules</a></li>
<li><a href="http://files.ianrenton.com/DreamingAwakeTabletop/DACharacterSheet.pdf">Blank Character Sheet</a></li></ul>
My first Dreaming Awake game used its own purpose-built system.  Due to issues discovered in play (see the <a href="../dreaming-awake-game-1">Dreaming Awake Game 1</a> page, where the system itself is also detailed), this was abandoned in favour of the current nWoD-based game.
