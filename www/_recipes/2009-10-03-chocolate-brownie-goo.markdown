This is not a recipe for gooey chocolate brownies - in the battle between brownie and goo, the goo is a clear winner.  There's little point attempting to pick them up with your fingers, you might as well just go straight for a spoon.  In fact, the best enjoyment of this recipe was achieved by letting two dozen slightly drunk geeks just help themselves straight out of the dish.  Needless to say, getting within 20 feet of the finished product will result in immediate Type 2 Diabetes.

## Ingredients (this will serve as many people as you can fit in your house)
	
  * 11 oz dark chocolate, in pieces
  * 11 oz butter
  * 1 lb granulated sugar
  * 5 large eggs
  * 7 oz plain flour
  * 8 oz glacé cherries

### Method

  1. Preheat the oven to 180 C.
  2. Melt the chocolate and the butter together in a bowl placed above a saucepan of simmering water.<br/>[![Chocolate and Butter Mixture](https://files.ianrenton.com/sites/recipes/IMG_7818-300x200.jpg)](https://files.ianrenton.com/sites/recipes/IMG_7818.jpg)
  3. Beat the eggs and sugar together in a separate large bowl until combined.<br/>[![Egg and Sugar Mixture](https://files.ianrenton.com/sites/recipes/IMG_7826-200x300.jpg)](https://files.ianrenton.com/sites/recipes/IMG_7826.jpg)
  4. Once the chocolate is done (no lumps!), pour it into the egg mixture and beat well.<br/>[![Wet Ingredients Mixed](https://files.ianrenton.com/sites/recipes/IMG_7829-300x200.jpg)](https://files.ianrenton.com/sites/recipes/IMG_7829.jpg)

  7. Sample the mixture.
  8. Add the cherries.
  9. Sample the mixture.
  10. Line a baking dish with greaseproof paper, and pour what remains of the mixture in.
  11. Bake until everyone is fed up of waiting.  (20 minutes will produce the titular goo, 30-40 minutes will result in actual brownie texture.)
  12. Wait at least 10 minutes for it to cool.  If anyone is impatient and burns their tongue on the hot mixture, this problem can be resolved by soaking the tongue for an extended period in Scotch.
