This is a dish I cooked a lot at university - it's mostly potatoes, which are cheap as chips (groan), and it's a good warming winter dish for a house-full of hungry people.  It can happily be made without the chicken for vegetarians or tight budgets.  Needless to say, it was there that it was nicknamed "Grated Dolphin".

### Ingredients (to serve 4)

  * 1 1/2 lb potatoes, peeled and quartered
  * 1 lb chicken
  * 4 leeks, washed, trimmed and sliced
  * 4 cloves garlic, crushed
  * 3oz cheddar cheese, grated
  * 6 fl oz single cream
  * 3 fl oz milk
  * 1/2 tsp nutmeg
  * butter

### Method
	
  1. Preheat the oven to 180 C.
  2. Parboil the potatoes for 7-10 minutes.
  3. Meanwhile, cut the chicken into strips or small chunks, then fry until nearly done.
  4. Add a knob of butter to the pan, then add the leeks and fry until golden and the chicken is properly done.  Add the garlic at the end.
  5. Put the chicken, leeks and garlic into the bottom of an oven dish.
  6. Once the potatoes are done, drain them and soak them in cold water until cool enough to touch.
  7. Thinly slice the potatoes, and lay them on top of the chicken mixture.
  8. Mix together the milk, cream and nutmeg, then pour the mixture over the potatoes.
  9. Sprinkle the cheese over the top.
  10. Bake until the potatoes are tender (should take 45-60 minutes).
