This is my (and my mum's) recipe for Djej Metisha Mesla, which I think is a Moroccan dish of chicken, tomatoes and rice.  Eric refers to it as "Chicken Jihad", for reasons best left unsaid.

### Ingredients (to serve 4)
	
  * 4 chicken breasts
  * 1 onion, chopped
  * 1 garlic clove, crushed
  * 2 tsp cinnamon
  * 1/4 tsp ginger
  * 400g chopped tomatoes
  * 2 tbsp honey
  * 4 cups long grain rice
  * blanched almonds / sesame seeds to garnish.

### Method
	
  1. Fry the onion in a large casserole dish until soft.
  2. Add the chicken, brown and cook until nearly done.
  3. Add the tomatoes, garlic and spices.
  4. Bring to the boil, cover, and simmer gently for 30 minutes.
  5. Meanwhile, cook the rice (should take around 15-20 minutes).
  6. Increase heat and remove lid to thicken the tomato sauce if necessary.
  7. Stir the honey into the chicken/tomato pan and heat through.
  8. Serve garnished with the almonds or sesame seeds.
