### Synopsis

RACHEL DAWES from the NEW BATMAN is the daughter of the OLD BATMAN.  Who is the PRESIDENT.  PRESIDENT BATMAN.  I'm sure some OTHER STUFF happened, but my MIND was sufficiently BLOWN not to notice.

PRESIDENT FUCKING BATMAN.

Also PRESIDENT BEETLEJUICE, which is probably even more epic.
