> A Film Review by the Numbers from the pen of Ian "Devo" Montgomery!

Synopsis
--------

NO-ONE would have believed in THE LAST YEARS OF THE 19TH CENTURY that H.G. WELLS' EPIC TALE of alien invasion would be turned into a MEDIOCRE ACTION ROMP by one of the world's (supposedly) GREATEST FILMMAKER'S in the early 21st century.

However, in the early years of the 21st century, ALMOST EVERYONE believed it was not only possible, but inevitable.

Cue TOM CRUISE as EVERYMAN THE DEADBEAT DAD, struggling not only to stay alive amidst an ALIEN INVASION but also desperately trying to win HIS CHILDREN'S love... and failing.
