## Synopsis

The MAYANS had it all right, and we're ALL GOING TO FUCKING DIE.  This is because of THE SUN and EARTHQUAKES and SUPERVOLCANOS and NEUTRINOS and PRINCESS DIANA and probably some OTHER SHIT too.

Oh, and the EARTH'S CRUST is displaced by EXACTLY THE RIGHT AMOUNT to mean that the HEROES' PLANE lands EXACTLY WHERE IT NEEDS TO even though it ran out of FUEL but it's still a CHOPPY LANDING with no UNDERCARRIAGE but luckily they can RAMP OFF THE BACK OF THE CARGO DOORS in a VOICE-CONTROLLED BENTLEY.
