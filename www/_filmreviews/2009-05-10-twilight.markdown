Synopsis
--------

The LIVING DEAD walk the earth, and are really fucking EMO.  They also have the following discipline dots: CELERITY 3, POTENCE 3, AUSPEX 4, DOMINATE 2, PRESENCE 1.  Which makes them all pretty nails, and they have no disadvantages at all whatsoever except a fondness for MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE.  Naturally, one falls in love with a MARY-SUE called BELLA, who is then subjected to COOL SHIT but decides to ANGST about it.
