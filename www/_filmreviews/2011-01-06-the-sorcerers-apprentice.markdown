## Synopsis

ANNOYING WIMPY KID secretly has ULTIMATE COSMIC POWER.  He meets NICHOLAS KANE, who he promptly locks in a BOTTLE for 10 YEARS.

When he finally emerges, he teaches ANNOYING WIMPY UNDERGRAD to SAVE THE WORLD by using MAGIC. Which is naturally possible because MUGGLES only use 10% OF THEIR BRAIN and OH GOD WHY WON'T HOLLYWOOD LET THAT EXPLANATION DIE?!

Anyway, yeah, they save the world and shit.  With RAPID-FIRE KAMEHAMEHAs and STEALTH MOTHERFUCKING TESLA COILS.
