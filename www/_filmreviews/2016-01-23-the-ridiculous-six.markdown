## Synopsis

It's 2015, and "A NETFLIX ORIGINAL MOVIE" is the new "DIRECT TO VHS". In this EXEMPLARY WASTE OF CELLULOID, the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is PISSED ALL OVER by ADAM FUCKING SANDLER.

And the fact that [A DOZEN OF THE CAST walked out of the production on grounds of ALL THE RACISM](http://variety.com/2015/film/news/adam-sandler-ridiculous-six-native-american-actors-walk-off-set-1201478694/) and you just know you're IN FOR A TREAT.

The kind of TREAT where you unwrap it and discover that not only has SOMEBODY ALREADY EATEN THE CHOCOLATE, they've replaced it with A CREATION OF UTTER, UNSPEAKABLE HORROR FROM THE DEPTHS OF YOUR DARKEST NIGHTMARES.

Thanks ADAM SANDLER!
