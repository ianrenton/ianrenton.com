## Synopsis

NEW YOIK. You may remember this view of it from such films as HOME ALONE, including some of the cast. This time, however, we have no CULKIN, fewer MISCHIEVOUS HIJINKS and some mild romantic comedy SHENANIGANS.

## Overall: 2 / 5


At least it has a plot, but not much new ground to tread. The acidity levels of the dialogue are also too high.
And things happened, then the film ended.
