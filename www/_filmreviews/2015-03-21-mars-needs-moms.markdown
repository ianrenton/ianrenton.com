## Synopsis

MARTIANS, having evolved over MILLIONS OF YEARS into a SENTIENT and HIGHLY ADVANCED SPECIES, have apparently no idea how to raise their CHILDREN without stealing HUMAN MOTHERS, vapourising them and implanting their MEMORIES into DISCIPLINE DROIDS.

Naturally, it takes a PLUCKY YOUNG SETH GREEN, NERDY DAN FOGLER and a HIPPY ALIEN to SAVE THE DAY and defeat the EVIL FEMINISTS and teach the MARTIANS to be a VIABLE SPECIES again.
