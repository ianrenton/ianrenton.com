## Synopsis

All the WHITE GUYS in HONG KONG have PSYCHIC POWERS and DYSFUNCTIONAL LIVES. Now they must BAND TOGETHER to stop the INEVITABLE SHADOWY GOVERNMENT AGENCY from creating the INEVITABLE ARMY OF MUTANT SOLDIERS.

Constantly tracked by WATCHERS who SEE THE FUTURE, they avoid having their FUTURE ACTIONS predicted by having NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK THEY ARE DOING.

It's INEVITABLY SUPER EFFECTIVE.
