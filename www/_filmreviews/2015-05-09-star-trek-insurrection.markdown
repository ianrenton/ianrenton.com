## Synopsis

BEARDY ADMIRAL and the SKIN-STRETCHY LIZARD PEOPLE (the hottest punk band of 2015!) attempt to relocate SOME PEOPLE so that they can SWOOP IN and STEAL the MAGICAL MACGUFFIN.

Thankfully SOME BALD DUDE in a SPACESHIP is here to SAVE THE DAY!

Despite having SPACESHIPS and EXPLOSIONS and GUNS and REBELLION and ALIENS and ROBOTS it is in fact PRETTY BORING.
