Synopsis
--------

The year is 1914. Fifteen years after the PLOT of some VAGUELY RELATED H.G. WELLS BOOK, the MARTIANS are back! 
This time, we fight them not with BACTERIA but with MISSILES and RADAR and HEAT RAY GUNS and ZEPPELINS and
GIANT ROBOTS and ETHNIC DIVERSITY.

Surprise surprise, in true HOLLYWOOD ALIEN/DISASTER MOVIE STYLE, most of humanity is probably dead but hey,
WE WON!
