KID meets WOMAN. WOMAN is cold-hearted and bitchy. KID fucks WOMAN. WOMAN is cold-hearted and bitchy.  KID reads to WOMAN. WOMAN shows EMOTION. KID's LIFE is fucked up by WOMAN. WOMAN disappears.

MEANWHILE, in the FUTURE, KID is RALPH FIENNES and WOMAN was a NAZI.  Don't you just _hate_ it when that happens?

Also, KATE WINSLET'S NIPPLES are huge.
