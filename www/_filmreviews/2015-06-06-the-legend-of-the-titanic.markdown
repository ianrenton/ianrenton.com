## Synopsis

*Actually*, all those HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE who were "MISSING" in the GREATEST MARITIME TRAGEDY OF ALL TIME were TOTALLY FINE and it was all a GREAT BIG MISUNDERSTANDING and THE DAY WAS SAVED by FLYING DOLPHINS and CTHULHU and CARTOON. FUCKING. MICE.

I'm starting to wonder if [THE FUCKING RAPPING DOG](../titanic-the-legend-goes-on) might not have been an improvement after all.
