> A guest review by Ian‭ “‬Devo‭” ‬Montgomery

## Synopsis

Timelines collide...‭ ‬but not really.‭ ‬A sparkly bliss-ribbon flies through space which a crazy old British nutter wants to throw himself into in the most convoluted and mass-murderous manner imaginable.‭ ‬Also,‭ ‬the greatest question in the history of Star Trek is finally answered:‭ ‬Who is the better starship captain‭? (‬It's Sisko‭!)

## By the Numbers

* Wasted bottles of space champagne‭: ‬1
* William Shatner's dramatic pauses‭: ‬0‭ (‬You're doing it wrong‭!!)
* Key ship systems scheduled for Tuesday installation‭: ‬3
* Men overboard‭: ‬1‭ ‬+‭ ‬1‭ ‬woman
* Feels‭: ‬Dammit Picard,‭ ‬stop crying‭! ;__;
* Shockwave level‭: ‬OVER NINE-‭ ‬it's‭ ‬12‭ (‬trololol‭)
* Appointments with eternity kept‭: ‬2
* Picard‭ ‬+‭ ‬Kirk‭ = ‬Meh...
	
## Overall: 2 / 5
