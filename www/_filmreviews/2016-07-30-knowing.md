## Synopsis

Creepy 50s schoolgirl WEDNESDAY ADDAMS / RAIN MAN attempts to SAVE THE WORLD by cryptically writing the dates of future disasters in a TIME CAPSULE.

When it is unearthed 50 YEARS LATER, it's up to famous ACTOR / SHAVED LLAMA NIC CAGE and his band of SECOND-RATE ACTION MOVIE FRIENDS to prevent UNSPECIFIED FUTURE PERIL. Together they combine their powers of SKEPTICISM, ALCOHOLISM, PTSD and TERRIBLE CONVERSATION SKILLS to SAVE THE WORLD!

They fail, roll credits.
