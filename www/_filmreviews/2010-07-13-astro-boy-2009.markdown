## Synopsis

DOCTOR TENMA's son dies in a freak EVIL ROBOT ACCIDENT, so he resurrects him as a ROBOT BOY who ONLY WEARS PANTS.  And somehow doesn't think that's creepy.

Meanwhile, ASTRO BOY is not the slightest bit creeped out by the fact he now has SUPERPOWERS and ROCKET FEET, and thus proceeds to FIGHT CRIME.  Or, er, FIGHT VAGUELY NASTY PEOPLE and beat up A LOT OF ROBOTS, anyway.
