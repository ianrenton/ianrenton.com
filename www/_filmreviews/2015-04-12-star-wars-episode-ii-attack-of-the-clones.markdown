> A guest review by Ian "Devo" Montgomery

## Synopsis

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... AWFUL ROMANCE occurs, accompanied by MORE POLITICS and the least amount of action in any installment of George Lucas' infamous cinematic roleplaying game! Also, thinnly veiled references to the American Civil War and Anakin is now a teenager. An ANGSTY, WHINY teenager!
