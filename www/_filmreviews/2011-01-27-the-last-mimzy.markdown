## Synopsis

ANNOYING KID 1 and ANNOYING KID 2 go on holiday to a place that's LIKE, SO TOTALLY LAME.  While there, they discover a MAGICAL MACGUFFIN FROM TEH FUTU0R, which, naturally, is a DREAMCAST-SPONSORED PSYCHIC BUNNY.  The BUNNY is instructed to: 1) find a PURE GIRL, 2) MAKE HER CRY, and 3) make her build a WARP GATE.  To achieve this, THE BUNNY gradually gives them MUTANT SUPERPOWERS, slowly FUCKING WITH THEIR HEADS and drawing more and more PEOPLE into its TWISTED WEB OF MINDFUCKERY until all the HUMANS are conditioned to serve its DUBIOUS SPACE-ELEVATOR-FETISHISING WILL.

Also, ALICE IN WONDERLAND was all about NANOTECH.

Okay, no, wait, we figured it out.  We figured out how this makes sense.  Let's start again.

ANNOYING KID 1 and ANNOYING KID 2 go on holiday to a place that's LIKE, SO TOTALLY LAME.  While there, they discover a BOX on the BEACH.  It is full of MAGIC MUSHROOMS, LSD and WEED.  They start by eating the MUSHROOMS, and from that point on the every scene with the kids in it is ENTIRELY INSIDE THEIR HEADS.  Every scene _without_ them in is THEIR PARENTS trying to cope with their KIDS being ON DRUGS.
