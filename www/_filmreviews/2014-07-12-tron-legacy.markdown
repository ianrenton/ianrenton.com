Synopsis
--------

JEFF BRIDGES made DAFT PUNK a place where nobody would think they're weird. Then, it was TAKEN OVER by JEFF BRIDGES, resulting in an EPIC BATTLE between JEFF BRIDGES and JEFF BRIDGES for the fate of DAFT PUNK's HAPPY PLACE.

At least, I think that's what happened. I kind of lost track after the Michael Sheen bit.
