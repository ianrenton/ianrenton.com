## Synopsis

There are EVIL BLOKES with a GAY-LOOKING MASK, then it cuts to SOME KID who just happens to be NAILS. KILLING ensues along with SHENANIGANS and a LOVE INTEREST (of course) who turns out to be PRETTY NAILS too (for a WOMAN in ONE OF THESE THINGS, anyway)

## By the Numbers

  * Eggs left unbroken: 1
  * Barbarians killed by one small(ish) child: many
  * Not so feeble women: 1
  * Angst: over 9000
  * Cheese: over 9000
  * By Crom!: 1

## Overall: 4 / 5
