## Synopsis

A LOT OF PEOPLE pay to have sex with EMILY BROWNING.  Then, SOME OTHER PEOPLE pay A LOT MORE MONEY to _not_ have sex with EMILY BROWNING.

## By the Numbers

  * Boobs: over 9000
  * Vaginas: 3
  * Penises: 0 (Because obviously the Australian taxpayer couldn't pay to have a film with _dicks_ in it, that would be lewd)
  * Disney factor: minus infinity
  * Kubrick factor: 57
  * WTfactor: also over 9000
  * /d/ factor: remarkably low, really.  No, _she_ doesn't have a dick.
  * Dead guys in this film: 2?
  * Emotions showed in this film: 2?
  * Inexplicable credits for "original music": 1
  * Extent to which I now feel like a sex offender: yeah, let's go for over 9000.

## Overall: 2 / 5
