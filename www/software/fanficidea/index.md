A script to automate the generation of terrible fanfiction ideas.

Runs at [http://fanfic.onlydreaming.net](http://fanfic.onlydreaming.net).

Any reasonable "patches" to add more choices will be accepted and pushed live. The code (what little there is of it) is released into the Public Domain and you may do whatever you like with it.
