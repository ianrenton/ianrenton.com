War of the Roses is a 2D strategy/roleplaying game set in the world of my (otherwise pen-and-paper) [Changeling game](http://rpgs.ianrenton.com/changeling-in-love-and-war).  It is written in Java 1.5, and currently uses [PlanetCute tiles](http://lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html) for its graphics.  It was abandoned very early on in development.
