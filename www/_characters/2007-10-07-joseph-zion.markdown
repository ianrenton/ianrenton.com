<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>"Joseph Zion, Private Eye."  I fumble through my wallet, passing by the business cards in Ogham runes and the ones in Malachim, before discovering to my great surprise that I still had some English ones.</p>
<p>I produce it with a flourish, but the search had lasted minutes, and the effect was more-or-less completely lost.</p>
<p>I&#039;m not the kind of Private Eye you call to spy on your cheating husband.  No, any fool can do that.  It just requires skill, tenacity, and a bladder of steel.  I&#039;m missing at least two of those, you can take your pick.</p>
<p>No, where normal P.I.s might carry a notebook, I eschew this in favour of a tarot deck.  While phone taps and tiny microphones might be common amongst other detectives, I am more likely to be found using two yoghurt pots and a piece of string - but no normal yoghurt pots! Never in the history of dairy products have containers been so endowed with arcane sigils.</p>
<p>I consider producing them for inspection, but decline.  Some things were not meant for mere mortals to know of.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point.  Husband cheating on you?  Call the others.  Satan cheating on you with a coven of bewitched poultry?  I&#039;m your man.</p>
