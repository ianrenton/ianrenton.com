This page shows some of the designs that this website has had through its history as "The Mad Marmablue Web Portal", "Only Dreaming" and as IanRenton.com. A lot of awful stuff from my younger years is on display below!

### 1998&mdash;2001

I can't find much on the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org/web/) for the early days of the site. Its original URL may have been http://members.tripod.com/__lep, followed by http://www.geocities.com/marmablue, http://marmablue.cjb.net, http://members.dencity.com/marmablue/, http://marmablue777.f2s.net, and http://members.lycos.co.uk/marmablue7/php/index.php.

### 1998-ish

My first foray onto the Web was a site created in MS Word. It was everything you imagine and more&mdash;animated GIF backgrounds, auto-playing MIDI music and all. Mercifully, no content appears to have survived on the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org/web/) or elsewhere. I believe its original URL may have been `http://members.tripod.com/__lep`.

### 2000-ish

I learned how to use frames, and how to code my HTML from scratch (by copying other sites), so there was another version of the site that proudly sported a "built in Notepad" badge. I remember a drop-down menu for navigation, a second drop-down to choose the auto-playing background MIDI (what luxury!) and a white on black/blue colour scheme. This version was hosted at `http://www.geocities.com/marmablue`, and no content has survived.

### February 2001

This is possibly the third version of the "Mad Marmablue Web Portal". It was a static site and had a Javascript-based tree menu on the left, which the Internet Archive has not preserved. Again I learned by ripping off other sites' code.

This version (or variations of it) seemed to jump between a number of free hosting providers over a couple of years, and may have been hosted at `http://marmablue.cjb.net` (probably itself a forwarder), `http://members.dencity.com/marmablue/`, `http://marmablue777.f2s.net`, and `http://members.lycos.co.uk/marmablue7/php/index.php`.

### April 2003

An early Wiki version, my first move from static HTML pages to some kind of "proper" back-end. It was contributed to by a few friends. This is the first archive after the site received its own domain, `marmablue.co.uk`. Having a proper domain seems to increase the chances of the Internet Archive capturing its content, so there is more recorded from this point onwards.

### June 2003

A slightly nicer-looking version.

### May 2004

We abandoned the Wiki after a while. With my blog on Livejournal, I made my homepage into a simple index page. Unfortunately the "chat" box on the left hand side was largely filled with spam.

### June 2004

The chat box was quickly dropped, replaced inexplicably with direct links to stuff running on my home PC&mdash;all apparently offline.

### March 2005

Back to hosting real content, now centred around fiction and stories. This used a custom back-end written in PHP that I remember being very proud of at the time.

### July 2010

The site migrated via Drupal to WordPress, and I can't find a lot of screenshots from this progression. The site was renamed from "The Mad Marmablue Web Portal" to "Only Dreaming", and was moved to `onlydreaming.net`. My blog moved over from LiveJournal in around 2009. Here's one of the still largely fiction-oriented WordPress themes.

### October 2011

And a cleaner, sans-serif version. Use of CSS-minifying plugins has prevented the Internet Archive from capturing the stylesheets for a number of intermediate themes.

### July 2013

From around 2013 I moved from WordPress to Octopress 2 and dropped the "Only Dreaming" name in favour of simply `ianrenton.com`. This version is a plain HTML page that largely links to Octopress sites on a number of subdomains. Social network links and links to other sites I made are prominent.

### September 2013

The Octopress 2 version of the blog, which was separate from other sections such as hardware/robots and software.

### September 2014

A prettier but much more image-heavy version of the homepage. Pictures for each link are monochrome until mouse-over when the CSS effect is removed and full colour is displayed.

### November 2014

A small iteration on the Octopress 2 blog.

### August 2015

Everything back under one subdomain, now on Octopress 3 which makes this more easily possible.

### September 2015

A short-lived "typewriter-style" version which I liked visually, but proved hard to read.

### December 2015

Possibly going a little too far to distinguish the menus.

### January 2016

Back to a more stock-Jekyll theme, still serif and focussed on text.
