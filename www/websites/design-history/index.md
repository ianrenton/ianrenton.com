This page shows some of the designs that this website has had through its history as "The Mad Marmablue Web Portal", "Only Dreaming" and as IanRenton.com. A lot of awful stuff from my younger years is on display below!

### April 2003

An early Wiki version, my first move from static HTML pages to some kind of "proper" back-end. It was contributed to by a few friends.

### June 2003

A slightly nicer-looking version.

### May 2004

We abandoned the Wiki after a while. With my blog on Livejournal, I made my homepage into a simple index page. Unfortunately the "chat" box on the left hand side was largely filled with spam!

### June 2004

The chat box was quickly dropped, replaced inexplicably with direct links to stuff running on my home PC.

### March 2005

Back to hosting real content, now centred around fiction and stories.

### July 2010

The site migrated via Drupal to WordPress, and I can't find a lot of screenshots from this progression. My blog moved over from LiveJournal in around 2009. Here's one of the still largely fiction-oriented WordPress themes.

### October 2011

And a cleaner, sans-serif version.

### July 2013

From around 2013 I moved from WordPress to Octopress 2. This is a plain HTML page that largely links to Octopress sites on a number of subdomains. Social network links and links to other sites I made are prominent.

### September 2013

The Octopress 2 version of the blog, which was separate from other sections such as hardware/robots and software.

### September 2014

A prettier but much more image-heavy version of the homepage. Pictures for each link are monochrome until mouse-over when the CSS effect is removed and full colour is displayed.

### November 2014

A small iteration on the Octopress 2 blog.

### August 2015

Everything back under one subdomain, now on Octopress 3 which makes this more easily possible.

### September 2015

A short-lived "typewriter-style" version which I liked visually, but proved hard to read.

### December 2015

Possibly going a little too far to distinguish the menus.

### January 2016

Back to a more stock-Jekyll theme, still serif and focussed on text.
