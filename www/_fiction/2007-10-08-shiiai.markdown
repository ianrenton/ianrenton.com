<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div>
<p>"I, um...  I-I-I-I&#039;m Shiiai," I mutter, ashamed of stuttering even as I was halfway through doing so.</p>
<p>Lilac elbowed me in the waist.  "Confident, remember?  Y&#039;supposed to be bein&#039; confident!"</p>
<p>"Yeah," I said with a sigh.  "Yes, right, I&#039;m Shiiai.  Once, years ago, I looked after Lilac after her village rejected her.  I was always frail though, and since we&#039;ve been travelling together, it&#039;s been more like her looking after me.</p>
<p>"We work pretty well together, I think.  When we have to camp, she can find food in the wild, and I can cook it.  When we have to talk to people, I can do the thoughtful bit, and she can do the confident bit.  And as time goes by, I think we&#039;re rubbing off on each other.</p>
<p>"But yes, we&#039;re travelling.  Even after ten years, even on reaching adulthood, Lilac was never accepted back home.  So, um...  We ran away.  We&#039;ve been on the road ever since.  When, one day, we find a little village or a big city where no-one thinks she&#039;s weird, there we&#039;ll stay and call it home."</p>
