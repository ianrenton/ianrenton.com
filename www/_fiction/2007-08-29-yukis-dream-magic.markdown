<p>As I lay on the roof, temporarily relieved of my duties, late this morning... I recieved the answer I was hoping for. My basking in the sunshine was cut short as a shadow was cast over me. Looking up, beyond a white dress billowing in the gentle breeze, was a familiar face.</p>
<p>"Yuki!" I exclaimed, sitting up.</p>
<p>She smiled, and for a moment the air felt strange and cold around me. "I don&#039;t get to see the summer very often, you know... It&#039;s nice here," she said quietly.</p>
<p>"Yes," I muttered, turning to face her.</p>
<p>"But I&#039;m not just here to admire the weather. You want to ask me something, don&#039;t you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I... Well..."</p>
<p>"Show me."</p>
<p>"But..."</p>
<p>"Don&#039;t worry, Kotori. No-one can see us up here. Show me."</p>
<p>I sighed, emptied my mind a little, closed my eyes, and stretched my wings. Somehow, every time, this felt good. And it never felt strange; maybe as if I&#039;d always had them.</p>
<p>As I opened my eyes and looked down at Yuki, I saw her smiling and felt comforted.</p>
<p>"Kotori," she said. "Do you remember that dream you had on the night after we first met?"</p>
<p>"Y... yes, of course. I could never forget that dream..."</p>
<p>"You dream of flying a lot, don&#039;t you? Of having wings."</p>
<p>"Well, yes, but... Those are just dreams."</p>
<p>"Just dreams? My dear, Kami like me are just dreams. Dreams made real by belief, by their Story. That&#039;s what we do. We take a single story and make it into everyone&#039;s Story. We make dreams come true. There&#039;s some that call that, magic."</p>
<p>"So... These wings are my dreams... made real?"</p>
<p>"That&#039;s right. Consider them a gift, from me."</p>
<p>"But how can I ever repay you?" I asked with eyes open wide.</p>
<p>"Don&#039;t worry, Kotori. You already have."</p>
<p>With that, the little girl hugged me tightly. After a few seconds, still tightly in my arms, she faded away to a sprinkling of snow that melted quickly to water on the warm roof. Hiding my wings, I jumped down from the roof and went back to the shrine.</p>
<p>And so, with a blessing in my heart, Golden Week began.</p>
