<p>This page lists some of the important political events during the past of Forgotten Children, showing how their society came about as the result of a chain of events beginning with Earth as it is today.</p>
<p><b>2359</b><br />
Due to skilful political manipulation, the UN completes its century-long rise to power by removing individual nations&#039; rights to declare their own laws or maintain a standing armed force.</p>
<p><b>2387</b><br />
The UN launches an initiative to vastly improve the Mars colonies. It is suspected that the population of Mars will reach a billion by 2400.</p>
<p><b>2402</b><br />
Disgruntled with the UN&#039;s liberalism and anti-business opinions, many of the solar system&#039;s top 50 companies join together to found the United Corporate Initiative.</p>
<p><b>2412</b><br />
Lacking the unopposed political and economic power it had enjoyed for half a century, the UN is forced to enter talks with the UCI.</p>
<p><b>2477</b><br />
With colonial opinions slowly turning against Earth due to the UN&#039;s policies, the UCI begins construction of a giant space station at Lagrange point L4.</p>
<p><b>2500</b><br />
As the new century dawns, the Free City is unveiled to the Solar System. Over the next twenty years, almost all of the UCI&#039;s member companies relocate to Free City.</p>
<p><b>2604</b><br />
After over a hundred years of mounting economic pressure, the UN becomes the last power to abandon its own financial system in favour of the Free City credit system.</p>
<p><b>2651</b><br />
Political tensions between the Martian Republic and the UN come to a head, and war is declared. With the bias- and conscience-free UCI selling arms and information to both sides, the war is to last nearly a decade.</p>
<p><b>2659</b><br />
Emerging the victors, the Martians set about rebuilding their damaged economy with generous help from the UCI. Faced with a ravaged planet and a failing ecosystem, the remnants of the UN take out a huge loan from the UCI to enable the majority of Earth&#039;s population to evacuate and begin new lives on the Lunar colonies. Crippled by debt and the moon&#039;s lack of resources, they never truly recover.</p>
<p><b>2718</b><br />
The Europa colony disappears, along with Europa itself, in a mysterious accident.</p>
<p><b>2836</b><br />
High on the wealth of the Solar System, the UCI establishes the Explorer Federation, an initiative to depart the Solar System in search of new pastures to colonise and exploit.</p>
<p><b>2891</b><br />
The Celestial Fleet, EFS Sun Dancer, Star Valkyrie and Moon Seraph, leave Free City, their inhabitants becoming the first extrasolar travelers.</p>
