<p>It was yet another morning, yet another hangover. I&#039;d been unlucky recently – more than unlucky. To tell the truth, I hadn&#039;t had a client in weeks.</p>
<p>So it was that I woke up to a loud and irritating alarm-clock buzz that morning. Eight in the morning. The infernal contraption received the closest to a withering glare as I could manage at that time, and I rolled over in bed. Clang.</p>
<p>A frying pan. Inexplicably, there was a frying pan in my bed, right where I tried to roll over to. I sat up and prodded the thing until I was thoroughly sure it wasn&#039;t going to bite me, and then removed the sticky note from the handle.</p>
<p>“You have a client! 9am!”</p>
<p>Ah. One of those days.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I was still lost in the murky fuzz inside my own head, half-hangover and half-coffee, when the woman arrived. She hung her long brown coat and hat on the hook inside my door, and proceeded up the stairs to the paper-littered room that for the sake of argument I called the office. It was getting better these days. It used to complain all the time that it wanted to be called Steve, but now we quarrel less and it&#039;s reasonably happy with “office”.</p>
<p>So, this woman. Prim, proper, boring. A lost cat, I figured, or a jealous husband. How wrong I was.</p>
<p>“A great evil stalks this land,” she said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.</p>
<p>“Of course,” I replied. And meant it. You didn&#039;t last long in the private investigation business without having some idea of who pulled the strings in society. Demons and the Illuminati, mainly. Anyway, I digress again.</p>
<p>“Which evil in particular?” was my question to her.</p>
<p>“There are tales... Dark tales,” she responded, trying to sound mysterious. “About goings-on in the town of Aylesbury.”</p>
<p>“Don&#039;t you mean &#039;Duck Tales&#039;?” I asked, but the pun was lost on her. Obviously not a fan of children&#039;s television. Or not a fan of puns.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Either way, I agreed to work for her. The pay was good – any pay&#039;s good to a man who&#039;s been surviving mostly on whisky for a week.</p>
<p>And here I am, in Aylesbury. Darkness is abroad, evil stalks the face of the Earth, and some batty humourless woman wants me to find out what&#039;s going on. I could fill volumes, I really could. Devils plotting Armageddon, secret societies and their even more secret wars, and even the truly despicable evil of the Women&#039;s Institute coffee mornings. But I got the feeling she already knew about that. There was something else here. Something even more dark and twisted...</p>
