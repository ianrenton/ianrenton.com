Suppose that you and I were sitting in a quiet fish bowl,

We're sitting in a quiet fish bowl.

We're swimming in a quiet fish bowl.

Because we're fish.

I'm not a fisherman's daughter.

I'm a fish's daughter.  Yes.  Maybe.

I don't remember my father.

Because I'm a fish.

Was that bubbling thing in here yesterday?

Anyway, what were you saying about geisha?

My sister was a geisha, you know.

Or maybe just a koi carp.  I forget.

Oh look, food!

Yummy pellety food.

Did I mention that I was a fish?
