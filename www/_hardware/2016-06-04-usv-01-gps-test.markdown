In the current version of my build, I am using a servo control board that uses the Raspberry Pi's only UART as its control interface. As such, to communicate with the UART GPS, I need a second UART available. (See the footnotes on [the BOM](../usv-01-bill-of-materials).) The easiest way to achieve this is with the simple CP2102 USB to UART converter.

The uBlox NEO-6M GPS requires a ~50mA 3.3V supply, which luckily the CP2102 can supply. Out of the factory it supplies 5V on its Vcc output pin, but a selector on the reverse of the board can be re-soldered so that 3.3V is provided instead.
