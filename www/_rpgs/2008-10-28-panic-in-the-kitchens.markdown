<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p><font color="red">GM OC: Forked out of "Event: Welcome Home Poppies!"</font></p>
<p>Hugh practically screamed at the waiter.</p>
<p>"Get a hold of yourself! Just because the trifle and everything else in<br />
the kitchen is poisoned, there are dents in the new frying pans and<br />
there&#039;s a petty poisoner unconscious in the kitchen there is NO. NEED.<br />
TO. PANIC!!!!"</p>
<p>Abandoning all decorum, Hugh charged the remainder of the way to the<br />
kitchen, panting "Don&#039;t panic!" under his breath. Screeching to a halt,<br />
he rounded the corner into the kitchen and, seeing the entire kitchen<br />
swivel to face him sought to establish priorities.</p>
<p>"I AM PERFECTLY CALM!!!</p>
<p><font color="red">OC: Help! I&#039;m stuck in a post factory and they keep whipping me and my fingers are just bloody stumps! :(</font></p>
<p>With great presence of mind, the nearest chef whipped a lukewarm cup of<br />
tea off the nearest sideboard and hurled it, managing to get at least<br />
half of it into the screaming faerie&#039;s wide open mouth. Spluttering and<br />
dripping the other half onto the floor, Hugh took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Right. Yes. Thank you. Where was this poisoner found?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Argh!  The tea!  In my eyes!" screamed the still frantic<br />
waiter, who&#039;d managed to get splashed by the ballistic beverage.</p>
<p>"Over here, by the sink," said a rather more coherent sous-chef.  She led Hugh and the others over to what <i>could</i><br />
technically be called a sink, but would more honestly be called a vast<br />
continental land-mass of bubbles.  More than two dozen people<br />
worked at stages along it, cleaning the dishes of the hundreds of<br />
guests in preparation for forthcoming courses.</p>
<p>In one corner of the expanse, a rather sorry-looking figure lay slumped<br />
against a supporting post.  On closer inspection, he was in fact<br />
chained to the post.  He was a strange-looking man by human<br />
standards, but to the faeries he was somewhat less of a mythical<br />
creature.  His legs were huge and powerful, and terminated in<br />
hooves, whilst his upper body resembled merely that of a - well-muscled<br />
and very hairy - man.</p>
<p>A gaggle of chefs, waiters and miscellanous staff were standing around<br />
- mostly aimlessly, although one small child was poking the unconscious<br />
captive with a serving fork.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"No no no! Where are your priorities? The poisoner&#039;s clearly not going<br />
anywhere and I&#039;ve no idea what needs doing with him! But the food,<br />
that&#039;s going to need checking, starting where he was found."</p>
<p>Hugh absent-mindedly swept a teatowel off the nearby rack and handed it to the overwrought waiter.</p>
<p>"Stop that washing up! Don&#039;t serve anything else. Where&#039;s the bottle?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Here it is!" shouted the fork-poking child, whilst the waiter ran off<br />
to bother the washing-up servants.  She very nearly picked the<br />
bottle up to give to Hugh, before an ample lady who presumably was her<br />
mother pulled her back.</p>
<p>"Aww," she whined, but pointed Hugh to the bottle anyway.  It lay<br />
on the floor where the captive had presumably dropped it.  It was<br />
mostly empty bar a few drops of black liquid left in the bottom and, as<br />
the waiter had told him, did indeed have a skull and crossbones<br />
prominently emblazoned on the side.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano paused for at the entrance to the kitchens. He felt some<br />
trepidation at entering Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall&#039;s domain whilst the<br />
chef was in residence after it had been invaded.</p>
<p>Then he caught a glimpse of the poisoner in the corner of the room and he felt his hackles rise.</p>
<p>"How dare he try to ruin our coming home party" He thought to himself<br />
as he marched over, converting his boomerang back into a spear along<br />
the way.</p>
<p>As he approached the unconcious fae he started to poke it in the legs<br />
with his spear.  Eventually the pain brought it round.</p>
<p>"Tell me what you were doing in the kitchens and why!" The Raccoon<br />
demanded, with all the authority of a Noble of Faerie behind his words.</p>
<p><font>OOC That&#039;s a sovereign two (Dictum) command to tell me everything I want to know.</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Hugh nodded, rootled around in his jacket and pulled a small lump of<br />
English Toffee from his pocket from the small stash he kept for just<br />
such occasions. Handing it to the small child with a grin, he swept a<br />
clean set of tongs from the drying washing up and strode purposefully<br />
over to the bottle.</p>
<p>Kneeling down next to it, he carefully scooped it up and lifted it near<br />
the cavernous Fearnley-Whittinstall nose. He sniffed carefully.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p><font color="red">Nyano casts the Dictum (Sovereign 2) cantrip!<br />
Rolling (Charisma) 6 + (Kenning) 1 = 7 dice.  No applicable specialty.<br />
Target is stunned, so difficulty 5.<br />
4 successes!<br />
The poisoner has Willpower 2, and cannot resist.</font></p>
<p>"Sir!" the man blurts out with uncharacteristic consciousness.<br />
"Please don&#039;t kill me, I&#039;m just a poor man, I&#039;m only doing it because I<br />
was paid..."</p>
<p>Tears started to form in the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>"I don&#039;t even know who sent me, or what&#039;s in the bottle...  It<br />
was... a man who wore a mask, to hide his face.  He said he&#039;d kill<br />
me if I didn&#039;t...  But if I did, my family would never go hungry<br />
again..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looks unsympathetic.</p>
<p>"If you needed the work or food you should have petitioned your liege<br />
lord. Now, I may decide to be lenient on you if you tell me everything<br />
you know about this man.</p>
<p>Where did you meet him? Did he have a funny accent or five fingers on his right hand? Stuff like that."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Hugh lifted the bottle to his nose, inhaling deeply.  Despite<br />
there being little left of the liquid, it smelt horrifically<br />
pungent.  The scent of chilli, and of tea, and of aubergine; they<br />
were certainly there.  But also fainter whiffs of blueberries and<br />
rabbits, foxgloves and deadly nightshade, cat-mittens and happy<br />
nightshade, arsenic and Arsenal.</p>
<p>A truly strange concoction indeed, and... possibly deadly.  Or<br />
maybe just tasty.  It&#039;s a little difficult to tell from just the<br />
smell.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the head scout was deep into the grilling of their<br />
captive.  (With such a furry captive, it was probably wise that he<br />
did not choose to use an <i>actual</i> grill.)</p>
<p>He...  He met me in a forest, far from here to the west.  I<br />
was scavenging for what food I could find.  I...  I have a<br />
large family, and they are not... not well able to survive without<br />
me...  He... he spoke confusingly.  I could fathom little<br />
besides what he wanted me to do, sir.  He said...  He might<br />
have said his name was...  Indigo something."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"&#039;Indigo Something&#039;? I&#039;ll have my men keep an eye out by anyone of that<br />
name. Now for the important question, What did you actually put the<br />
poison in?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well...  Well...  As much... as I could find.<br />
He...  The man told me that a mere drop should do, so I<br />
should...  add it to as much as I could..."</p>
<p>So saying, the captive burst properly into tears, dejectedly fiddling with the chains that still tied him to the sink.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano had to supress his panic when he heard how many items of food were poisoned.<br />
He looked frantically around the bustling kitchen, and then an idea occured to him.</p>
<p>His eyes settled on three of his men who had just stumbled in through the door.<br />
"Wilks, Sooty, Clyde, get over here and unhook the prisoner. We&#039;re going to take him for a little walk!"</p>
<p>He turns to prisoner "We&#039;re going to take you around the kitchen, and<br />
if you think you might have put poison in a dish, you&#039;re going to point<br />
it out. Remember, if any poisoned dishes go out to the crowd you&#039;re<br />
going to be tried for murder, or worse..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p><font color="red">Holy haddock, Dictum lasts for an hour =S</font></p>
<p>The three guards unchained the somewhat limp captive, and between them hefted him around the kitchen.</p>
<p>"That one," he said, pointing vaguely at a large pot bubbling on the stove.  "And that one, and that one..."</p>
<p>This continued for some dozen or so pots of cooking food, until the<br />
captive let his gaze dwell guiltily for slightly too long on a pot that<br />
had already been used, served from, and placed in a stack to be<br />
washed...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Hugh had the scent of it now, the important thing was to make sure no one else got the <i>taste</i><br />
of it. Legs pumping, he charged back out of the kitchen straight back<br />
towards the assembled guests, only to almost run into a familiar figure<br />
on the way there. He jinked and was about to carry on running past when<br />
a sudden thought struck him.</p>
<p>"You&#039;re Northern, right?"</p>
<p>"Aye ahm tha."</p>
<p>"Follow me."</p>
<p>And he took to his heels again. The important thing, he decided as he<br />
burst into the hall at full pelt, hair flying everywhere, clothes<br />
soaked in a thin layer of sweat, the important thing was not to spread<br />
panic by keeping the Poisoning as quiet as possible.</p>
<p>"EVERYONE!" he bellowed, somehow finding the air in his lungs to make himself heard over the hubbub of party conversation.</p>
<p>"THE FOOD&#039;S BEEN POISONED! NO ONE EAT ANYTHING!"</p>
<p>He raised his nose to the air, scenting for the distinctive scent he<br />
detected from the bottle inamongst a scene full of exotically perfumed<br />
fae. As he did so, he murmered to the following Captain.</p>
<p>"The stuff has distilled Arsenal in it."</p>
<p>The captains eyes widened, his nostrils flared and with a great scream<br />
of "THE TOOON FOREEEVERR!" he set his shoulder once more and began the<br />
deceptively fast run of the football hooligan towards a poor confused<br />
looking elderly gentleman still holding a loaded forkful up in the air.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p><font color="red">OC: Righty, this has gone back into the main hall<br />
again, and the Welcome Home Poppies thread is still catching up with<br />
Akane&#039;s investigations in the past.  Thus: Haaaaalt!  This<br />
bit will continue once Akane is up-to-date.  (Sorry!)</font></p>
<p>EDIT: Nyano/Gustaffsen-when-he-arrives, you can continue here so long<br />
as it doesn&#039;t end up waaay in the future of what&#039;s going on in the main<br />
hall.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Gustafssen hurried towards the kitchens, nearly bowling over a rapidly<br />
departing Hugh and Geordie combination.  Nevertheless, despite the<br />
delay caused by the unintelligible barrage of Northern insults,<br />
Gustafssen arrived in the kitchen to quite a sight.</p>
<p>No work was going on anymore; the eyes of hundreds of kitchen staff and<br />
others were on the odd parade making its way around the room.<br />
Nyano the raccoon led the group, pausing occasionally to glare at a<br />
rather hairy cloven-hoofed man who was looking warily around and<br />
pointing at pots and pans.  Supporting him and restraining him was<br />
the seemingly difficult task of no less than three guards, none of whom<br />
looked particularly happy to be there.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Standing in the Doorway Gustafssen surveyed the scene before<br />
pronouncing, "Never fear Gustafssen is here!"  To which half the<br />
Fae in the room dived under anything large and heavy that could be used<br />
as a sheild.  The rest of them, those too slow, too dim witted or<br />
too new to know what this meant, just stood there looking confused.</p>
<p>Completely oblivious to the reaction the Scientist continued in the<br />
vein of Doctors and scientists everywhere.  "Firstly we would like<br />
to know what is going on.  Secondly and more importantly we would<br />
like to know to whom we send the bill?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>On seeing Gustaffsen arrive the raccoon veers away from his party towards the engineer.</p>
<p>He holds out what looks like a marmite bottle that someone finally got<br />
around to labelling appropriately with one hand and points at the<br />
prisoner with the other.</p>
<p>"That idiot poisoned the meal with the stuff in this bottle. I was<br />
hoping you could tell us what it is, what the symptoms are and possibly<br />
work with Illandra&#039;s people towards making a cure."</p>

<p>Looking down at the small Racoon the Scientist says, &#8220;Ahhhh Nyano, it<br />
was you who interrupted us in our research?  Good, good.&#8221;<br />
Before taking out a small ancient looking accountant&#8217;s addition device<br />
and placing it on a work table.  &#8220;Poison you say?&#8221;  at which<br />
a few of the devices keys depressed and the crank lever pulled down<br />
with a kerchunk noise.  &#8220;And you want us to diagnose, symptomise<br />
and liaise with the Honeysuckle medics?  Seems fair enough.<br />
At least there&#8217;s no corsetry involved this time.&#8221;  Throughout this<br />
brief exchange the machine rattled along occasionally making expensive<br />
sounding kerchings.  This somewhat one sided exchange having<br />
concluded he throws open his bag and starts to rummage muttering to<br />
himself once more.  &#8220;Wo ist es? Wo ist es? Angegangen, angegangen<br />
wei? ich, da? sie innen hier irgendwo sind. Es ist nicht wie es ist<br />
einfach, sie nach allen zu verlieren.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah ha!  Here they are.&#8221;  And then with a great thud a small<br />
box was thumped down upon the desk in front of him.  A furtive<br />
whisper ran round the room, what was this that he had found?  A<br />
new device?  Possibly.  A new and awesome device? Kinda<br />
likely.  A new, awesome and potentially disastrous device with<br />
world shattering powers?  If they were unlucky.  Soon the<br />
buzz of excitement was reaching a fever pitch and the occupants of the<br />
kitchen were jostling with each other to either get a look at the box<br />
or to stay as far away from it as possible depending on whether<br />
curiosity or survival instinct won the toss.</p>
<p>And then Gustafssen took off the lid&#8230;</p>
<p><font color="red">OOC:  And with that I&#8217;m off to bed for the night. </font></p>
<p>[<font>Private to<br />
Nyano-Sgiathatch:  Note to Nayano:  The box contains 24 plain<br />
and simple looking mushrooms sitting snuggly in a tray of mud.</font>]</p>
<p>[<font>Private<br />
to GM: Translation: Where is it?  Where is it?  Come on, come<br />
on I know they&#039;re in here somewhere.  It&#039;s not like it&#039;s easy to<br />
lose them after all.</font>]</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looks down at the box in confusion.</p>
<p>"Don&#039;t you want to see the poison bottle, or talk to the medics? I&#039;m<br />
not sure what  good a group of mushrooms are, unless..."</p>
<p>Nyano brightens up as an idea hits him.</p>
<p>"Are they a crack squad of poison identifying mushrooms?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>As the little racoon spoke Gustafssen nodded along with his reasoning,<br />
&#8220;Interesting Idea.  But no I&#8217;m afraid not.  They are in fact<br />
just Mushrooms.  On the other hand they are like little sponges,<br />
what ever you put them in the seem to just soak right up.&#8221;  &#8220;Which<br />
is why,&#8221; he said, wagging his finger under  Nyano&#8217;s nose.<br />
&#8220;you should only ever wipe mushrooms clean not wash them.  But we<br />
digress, we have a job to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>This said he once more started rummaging through his bag with much<br />
clinking of glass and banging of small metal objects.  Finally he<br />
carefully unrolled a small length of cloth within which a large number<br />
or tiny atomiser sprays were securely stored.  Carefully he moved<br />
his hand along the rows of sprays quietly mumbling to himself, &#8220;Now<br />
what we need here is a spot of House but only one,&#8221; quickly he<br />
extracted a spray and applied it to a single mushroom.  &#8220;Then a<br />
liberal coating of CSI, both Miami and Vegas.&#8221;  Another spray but<br />
this time applied to all the mushrooms except one which he picked up<br />
and placed to the side of the tray.  &#8220;And a spot of Gray&#8217;s<br />
Anatomy, ER, Cadfael, Miss Marple, Quincy M.E. and a good dash of Only<br />
when I laugh.&#8221;  All of these bottles were gently sprayed over the<br />
mushroom cluster.  &#8220;And finally we need what every good<br />
investigation needs, a Victim.&#8221;  This final bottle was used on the<br />
lone mushroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we have everything almost right where we need it.&#8221;  This said<br />
the fae scientist scooped up the Poison bottle and dripped a drop of it<br />
onto the Victim mushroom.  Then he took out another atomiser from<br />
his coat pocket, this one slightly larger than the rest, with a long<br />
rubber squeeze bag running off of it, and glowing gently with a<br />
pearlescent multicoloured hue.  &#8220;And finally Das Material von<br />
Tr‰umen selbst!&#8221;<br />
And with one dainty squirt he sent a cloud of it dancing and scattering over the mushrooms.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was movement in the box as the mushrooms pulled<br />
themselves from their muddy resting place and stood before their<br />
creator.  The onlookers were unsure how a mushroom could look wide<br />
eyed and bushy tailed but never the less they all later agreed these<br />
mushrooms certainly gave that impression.  Well all except the one<br />
the was rolling around on the floor looking kind of sickly and<br />
ill.  Quickly Gustafssen addressed them in fluent mushroom<br />
informing them of the situation at hand and without a moment to lose<br />
they were off.  Some mushrooms scurrying around the kitchens<br />
taking samples of this, that and the other.  A couple of them<br />
helping the sick mushroom into a bed carefully made out of the mud in<br />
the box.  All the while one mushroom sat carefully watching soap<br />
operas on a small hand held television or playing with tennis ball.</p>
<p>Then turning back to Nyano Gustafssen said &#8220;As I said before, little<br />
sponges.  Soak up anything you put them in.&#8221;  Then pulling a<br />
carrot from his pocket and settling down on another work bench he<br />
continued.  &#8220;Now all we do is wait.&#8221;  And with that the small<br />
accounting machine made another expensive sounding Keching.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The fungal servants rushed hither and thither about the kitchen,<br />
collecting samples, using unrealistic technology to super-enhance<br />
photographs, and being exceptionally bitchy/sleuthy/British (as<br />
appropriate).</p>
<p>Before long, they had brought back to Gustafssen the results of their<br />
investigations.  Though many of the dishes seemed to contain a<br />
little of the strange savoury black liquid, including some of the<br />
puddings, none of them seemed harmful - at least, not particularly so<br />
to mushrooms.  The taste, they reported, was somewhat unusual and<br />
very strong.  The sort of thing you either love or hate,<br />
really.  Its ingredients were largely unknown to the vegetables,<br />
but the tastes they reported seemed chemically compatible with Hugh&#039;s<br />
earlier assumptions.</p>
<p>Once the word had spread amongst the mushrooms, the &#039;sick&#039; one was rapidly accused of faking it.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Reet!" came an almost-explicable exclamation from the doorway, as the<br />
Geordie stomped his way in.  "Mister Nyano, Hugh&#039;s a-wantin&#039; ye in<br />
the main &#039;all!  Mister Gutafssen, too, ye pro&#039;lly wouldnae go<br />
amiss!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p> &#8220;Ahha! Andere rufen aus. Gesch‰ft ist nicht im Alter so gut<br />
gewesen.&#8221;  Gustafssen exclaimed bouncing off the table in<br />
excitement.  &#8220;Well we guess things here are in order for the<br />
moment.&#8221;  Swiftly he crossed back to the table and started filling<br />
his bag once more the mushrooms lining up and jumping back into their<br />
tray.  Just before the accounting device was finally packed away<br />
it started creaking and a long strip of paper issued from one end;<br />
which Gustafssen quickly looked over, signed, and placed on the table<br />
beside the small racoon saying, &#8216;My bill sir,&#8217;  This said he<br />
turned and headed towards the dinning room.</p>
<p>[<font>Private to<br />

<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looks down at the bill, it takes him a minute to compute all the<br />
figures and by the time he&#039;s made sense of it Gustafssen has already<br />
left.</p>
<p>Shrugging his little raccoon shoulders, he gestures for the guards to bring the prisoner and heads out himself.</p>
