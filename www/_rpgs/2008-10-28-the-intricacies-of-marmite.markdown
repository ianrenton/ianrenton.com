<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel shut the door quietly after they had all entered, and walked over<br />
to a small altar/desk hybrid.  It was covered with books and<br />
randomly-scattered pieces of paper, with which Abel dispensed in the<br />
time-honoured tradition by brushing them all off onto the floor.<br />
"Right then," he said.  "Nyano, was it you who had the jar?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>For the third time today Nyano flourishes his prize, before dropping it neatly onto the desk.</p>
<p>"Here you go."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel was quite taken aback.  "I must admit," he said, "for a boy only two feet tall with paws, that was quite a flourish!"</p>
<p>"Now then," Abel continued, "what exactly was it you lot wanted me <i>hic</i> to do with this?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano smiles at the complement.</p>
<p>"We should ask it why it thinks it was put in our food, and if it<br />
overheard anything &#039;Indigo Something&#039; said about why he was doing this,<br />
hes the guy who gave it to the faun. Ask it how it came to Faerie as<br />
well, and where in the human world it came from."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"We should ask again what he looked like, what he wore, and<br />
particularly if he had any mannerisms we could use to identify him by,"<br />
Akane continued, single-minded focus cutting through the alcoholic<br />
haze. "We&#039;ll need a strategy, or at least that would be helpful. &#039;Good<br />
cop-bad cop&#039; would work - I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s become quite so notorious<br />
in Faerie."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Um, Akane? It&#039;s just a bottle, I don&#039;t think we need to go quite that<br />
far. Besides, Abel is the only person who can talk to it anyway"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"True," said Abel, "and I&#039;ve certainly not heard of &#039;Good Cop, Raccoon,<br />
Chef, Prince&#039; before.  How exactly does one go about being a good<br />
cop and a bad cop?"  Abel paused for a moment.  "Wait, I<br />
think I recall something about bad cops.  Are they the ones who<br />
eat too many doughnuts, or are those the good cops?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane blinked. "Wait, we&#039;re interrogating the <i>bottle</i>?<br />
That&#039;s what I get for only hearing half the conversation. Animate<br />
culprits are so much easier to intimidate..." she groaned. "And I&#039;ll<br />
have you know I can do a very effective &#039;bad cop&#039; too...but it doesn&#039;t<br />
involve donuts. It&#039;s the most classic interrogation technique: one<br />
person threatens, the other person acts reasonable and kind and<br />
pretends to take the subject&#039;s side."</p>
<p><i>((OOC: Wow, my character&#039;s less drunk, but I&#039;m acting drunk. I just<br />
realised how little sense that last post made. Fixing, hopefully.))</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>The poor raccoon stuck his chin out defiantly at Abel&#039;s comment.</p>
<p>"Why am I the only person listed by species? I&#039;ll have you know I am a<br />
scoutmaster and head of the military! I&#039;m not just any raccoon!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m sorry!" said Abel.  "I didn&#039;t mean it to be offensive, I<br />
just...  Well, look at it this way.  That makes you more<br />
interesting than us!  I mean, we all look kind of the same, but<br />
isn&#039;t being shaped like a raccoon rather than a human more fun?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t like being a raccoon, it&#039;s that you called<br />
everyone else by their rank or job. I just wanted to say that I&#039;m not<br />
just any raccoon, I&#039;m an important raccoon!"</p>
<p>Nyano looks sheepish.<br />
"I guess it sounds a little stuck up when I say it like that. I&#039;m sorry."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"It&#039;s okay," said Abel.  "It was my fault.  I&#039;m...  I&#039;m sorry."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>The raccoon looks up at Abel.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s ok, we were both being silly. Now shouldn&#039;t you question the bottle?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Yes, yes, you&#039;re right.  Now, where were we.  Oh yes, this<br />
is a variant of my own on a common cantrip.  It is normally a<br />
technique by which one can whisper to the soul of another, but I have<br />
adapted it a little so that many can speak, and of sensible volumes."</p>

<p>Abel stood behind the deskaltar, raised his hands above the jar, and<br />
began to mumble in who knows what language.  A wind blew through<br />
the room, leaving the already randomly-arranged papers statistically<br />
unaffected.  Small saplings grew up from the altar all around the<br />
jar, covering it completely in a kind o watercress, until with a flash of greenish light it was gone, and alone stood the jar.</p>
<p>It juddered, twisted slowly on its axis to... face... its audience?</p>
<p>Then, just as everyone was leaning closely just in case it could only whisper its own speech, it suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>"G&#039;day mates!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looks intently at the bottle</p>
<p>"Do you know anything about a man who might be called &#039;Indigo Something&#039;"?</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Indigo, y&#039;say?  Strewth!  Well, &#039;ere goes then!</p>
<p><font color="red">OC: Insert AQI here.  I can&#039;t be arsed to figure out how to gramatically represent it.</font></p>
<p>"Right, you see, back in the Dream, all the colours o&#039; the rainbow were<br />
walkin&#039; the earth.  And one day, back before time was time, some<br />
young Shiela went down the shops ta&#039; buy some Tim-tams an&#039; a jar of<br />
Vegemite.  Only the poor lass got holda&#039; marmite instead, an&#039; she<br />
didn&#039;t much like that.  So, when &#039;er mate Indigo Something popped<br />
round fa&#039; dinner, she gave it ta&#039; him, &#039;cos &#039;e said &#039;e &#039;ad a good use<br />
fer it.</p>
<p>"Now Mister Indigo popped back ta&#039; the Dream with this jar a&#039; marmite,<br />
&#039;an &#039;e emptied it out an&#039; filled it with poison ta&#039; bump off some big<br />
party!  Least, that&#039;s what me mate Reggie the other jar a&#039; marmite<br />
told me.  But hey, what&#039;d I know about things like that.<br />
I&#039;ve been having wi&#039; no poisons, I&#039;ve been an honest jar a&#039; marmite all<br />
my life!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"That&#039;s not quite how the story goes, I&#039;m afraid," Akane responded,<br />
trying not to think about the fact that she was talking to a bottle. <i>Maybe I did spend too long with the humans...</i><br />
"The partygoers saw an empty bottle labeleled with a skull and<br />
crossbones. They assumed that poison had been poured into the meal, and<br />
there was lots of panicking, until they realised it was actually a<br />
fairly harmless compound. Then they spent a long time wondering why<br />
anyone would <i>pretend</i> to poison them. Do you see what I&#039;m<br />
getting at? We&#039;re all very sure you&#039;re an honest jar of marmite. What<br />
we&#039;re not sure about is whoever brought you here, so we&#039;d appreciate<br />
anything at all you can tell us..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"The ones who bought me here?  Don&#039;t know nothing about them, mate.  Some guy with a beret and then this furry dude."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Well, please tell us if you noticed anything at all unusual or<br />
distinguishing about the guy with the beret, or anything interesting<br />
you might&#039;ve overheard in his coversation with the &#039;furry dude&#039;. Also,<br />
you said that Indigo is...a colour of the rainbow?" Akane asked.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well of course it&#039;s a colour of the rainbow, right?  Between Blue<br />
and Violet, yes?  But them two chaps, they didn&#039;t talk.  I<br />
think there was something about it being a secret.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I gotta go.  Throwing another prawn on Sindy, or<br />
something like that.  Lovely speaking to y&#039;all!  See ya&#039;!"</p>
<p>The Marmite jar rocked back and forth with less animation each time, until before long it was still and silent.</p>
<p>There was a lengthy pause.</p>
<p>"<i>Riiight</i>," said Abel.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Weeell." She said. "That was no help at all. A beret? What are the<br />
odds he&#039;ll keep that on?" She then turned to Abel and grinned. "That<br />
was still a brilliant job on the cantrip, though. You <i>have</i> to teach me that. Or, well, anything. I haven&#039;t really done that sort of thing much in the last century..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"A brilliant job?"  Abel was quite taken aback.  "Leave that<br />
one for when we get some useful information out of the thing.  It<br />
was far less successful and shorter-lasting than I had hoped.<br />
Perhaps, with a little refinement..."</p>
<p>Abel produced a pen from behind his ear, and started scrabbling around on the floor for a piece of paper.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane grinned. "You&#039;d be surprised. I couldn&#039;t do that. But then, I got<br />
used to not relying on that sort of thing...I was &#039;playing by their<br />
rules&#039; most of the time, so to speak."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"I don&#039;t think we should ignore the beret, if they don&#039;t know we know<br />
about it, well, the kind of person to wear a beret is the kind to keep<br />
it on unless they have to take it off dontcherknow.</p>
<p>A pity the cantrip didn&#039;t last longer, I&#039;ve always wanted to know<br />
whether Marmite jars love it or hate it. Neither way makes sense - if<br />
they hate it, they&#039;d struggle to get it out all the time. And if they<br />
love it, they&#039;d never let you take any out. Important question. I feel."</p>
<p>He trailed off.</p>
<p>"So anyway! What&#039;s the next step chaps? Furry chaps abound and no one at the party seemed to be wearing a beret..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"I think the furry chap he&#039;s talking about is the prisoner I&#039;ve got in the dungeon."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane gaped. "Wait, you have a prisoner? And you didn&#039;t tell us? I<br />
think he&#039;ll be likely to tell us a lot more than the marmite bottle!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"I already interrogated him, he&#039;s too stupid to know anything. That&#039;s<br />
why I had to resort to interrogating a funny speaking bottle.</p>
<p>"We can go question him again if you want. If we&#039;re quick the cantrip I<br />
cast to make him tell the whole truth might not have run out yet."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane shrugged. "Couldn&#039;t hurt. I could always hypnotise him, though I<br />
haven&#039;t done it in a while; they remember all sorts of things they<br />
can&#039;t consciously call to mind if you do it that way..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"We could certainly have a chinwag with the chap, see if mentioning the<br />
beret brings any memories flooding back. And besides, I want a quiet<br />
conversation with him about spoiling my fine celebratory dinner."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Just then, the door opened slightly and Ilandra&#039;s head appeared around<br />
the corner.  "Right, we&#039;re going home now, see ya tomorrow Akane!"<br />
she said, then disappeared as quickly as she had appeared.</p>
<p>Outside, presumably from closer to Abel&#039;s room than Ilandra intended,<br />
came Ilandra&#039;s voice again.  "Now run, before she realises what<br />
we&#039;re doing!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Hugh stuck his head around the still-open door.</p>
<p>"You chaps realise we heard that?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"We&#039;re planning a surprise party!" Ilandra called out. "Ruined the<br />
surprise now, haven&#039;t you?" the two exchanged a look. "Oh, and we also<br />
wanted extra time for each other..." she called.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>"A surprise party? For me? Oh. I&#039;m terrible sorry. But whatever for?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra stopped and rolled her eyes. "Not for you, for Akane. To<br />
welcome her home. Now it&#039;s just another party, rather than the quiet<br />
surprise we were planning..." she told him.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p><font color="red">Rolled perception + subterfuge (7), difficulty 4; 3 successes.</font></p>
<p>Akane realised something wasn&#039;t right...<i>Wait a second. Bag, run, before she realises...<b>Surprise party my vulpine ass!</b></i> "Excuse me," she told the others as she ran out of the room after Ilandra.</p>
<p>"Young lady," she said, with the full weight of what was now a hundred<br />
and ten years of age difference augmented by a childhood of both<br />
participating in and cleaning up after Ilandra&#039;s pranks, "Where the <i>hell</i> do you think you&#039;re going?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Back to the house of course... where else? what on earth do you take<br />
me for? I have to be the responsible one here and I can&#039;t even escape<br />
for an extended session of cuddling!"<br />
<font color="red">Ilandra rolls 4 d10 at difficulty 6 for Wits + Subterfuge<br />

<p>She cuddled Cain as if to prove her point.</p>
<p>"Also, I&#039;ve been getting nightmares recently so we thought it&#039;d be a good idea for him to move his stuff over tonight."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane gave her a look. "It is possible, though unlikely. I am prepared to believe you...if you show me what&#039;s in that bag."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"It&#039;s Cain&#039;s stuff, see?" Ilandra said, opening the bag to reveal<br />
Cain&#039;s clothing. "He can&#039;t exactly wear my stuff, so we have to take<br />
his."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane shook her head. "That much stuff? No. Not when he lives right<br />
next door. I think you&#039;re leaving. And I don&#039;t exactly blame you, but<br />
it&#039;s not even close to responsible. <i>There&#039;s a war on</i>,<br />
hadn&#039;t you noticed? People die. It&#039;s not safe out there. You could find<br />
out that overnight that everyone is dead!" she hissed quietly, not<br />
particularly wanting everyone in Abel&#039;s room to overhear.</p>
<p>"We have the only hospital in Faerie. We treat indiscriminately. We are<br />
a target. Not just for Red and White Roses anymore, but also for the<br />
Black Roses, whose true motives are unknown. And you&#039;re going to run<br />
off and let whatever happens happen. You deserve to be happy, cousin,<br />
but we don&#039;t have the time or the luxury.</p>
<p>"For the last century, I&#039;ve been hiding in the mortal world, pretending<br />
the war I knew was probably happening was Not My Problem. Certainly the<br />
fate of Faerie as a whole is not my particular responsibility. Nor was<br />
House Honeysuckle meant to be. That was going to be Lysander&#039;s job. Now<br />
it&#039;s yours. And, yes, mine, because there <i>isn&#039;t anyone else left</i>. It should never have been your job or mine; it isn&#039;t right nor fair that it now is; but there&#039;s no choice. <i>Everybody else is dead</i>, Ilandra.</p>
<p>"You can&#039;t walk away from <i>our people</i>. That&#039;s what being a noble <i>means</i><br />
- that you are responsible towards others. I could pretend that wasn&#039;t<br />
the case when I was the unimportant daughter of a cadet branch of the<br />
family - there was never really anything I was needed for - but I can&#039;t<br />
anymore. And neither can you.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m not going to try to stop you; go, have your damn vacation. I&#039;ve<br />
been solving other people&#039;s problems for the last century, and this was<br />
meant to be <i>my</i><br />
holiday, but I can&#039;t hide anymore. You also ran away from<br />
responsibility for a long time, and now you&#039;re going to what, keep<br />
running? You&#039;re the youngest Duchess we&#039;ve ever had, yet what&#039;s left of<br />
the House is all utterly devoted, would all die for you. Including me.</p>
<p>"I just hope that, if and when you come back, you don&#039;t find out we have," she said, defeated.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Firstly, I&#039;m not leaving for good, just a week maximum. Secondly,<br />
you&#039;re not in charge. Oh and thirdly, I helped make your parent&#039;s<br />
passage into the next shell painless, I helped my own parents die<br />
peacefully, I even helped my brother die peacefully, do I act like I&#039;ve<br />
lost my family? Not anymore." Ilandra was close to tears. "I had the<br />
worst nightmares for three months, and where were you? Missing presumed<br />
dead! That&#039;s where! I am not involving our house further in this war<br />
than it is right now! Furthermore, if anyone deserves any kind of<br />
holiday, it&#039;s me!"</p>
<p>Ilandra turned to go, shaking her head. "I haven&#039;t had a proper<br />
childhood, I had to assume responsibility. Now if you can&#039;t look after<br />
a house for a few days, let me know. But know this, Lysander would be<br />
deeply disappointed in your attitude."</p>
<p>She picked Cain&#039;s hand up and started to walk off.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane backed up against the wall, then slid down to sit on the floor in a huddle.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m sorry. I didn&#039;t know. I didn&#039;t <i>want</i> to know, too. But<br />
at the same time, I thought here was safe. I never thought the war<br />
would come here, don&#039;t you see? I wasn&#039;t needed for anything. Everybody<br />
was good at something but me. Lysander was studious, you were<br />
charming... Everyone was <i>more</i> at something." she said, more to herself than to the departing Ilandra, who had her back turned in indifference.</p>
<p>"If I had guessed, I would&#039;ve been back in a heartbeat, even if I had<br />
been one of the ones you had to help die painlessly. Instead, my<br />
cowardice cost me the last few years I might&#039;ve had with them. You&#039;re<br />
probably right...who wouldn&#039;t be dissappointed?"</p>
<p>Ilandra was probably gone. She didn&#039;t look at the hallway to see. She took a deep breath and pulled herself together. "Now I <i>am</i> good at something," she finished softly. "So I guess I should go do it."</p>
<p><font color="red">OC: "She set her shoulders and went back inside to<br />
interrogate the prisoner." removed, as I think Ilandra meant to<br />
interrupt you doing that.  Poke me if I&#039;m wrong!</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra sighed.</p>
<p>"Don&#039;t let it get to you Akane. We&#039;ll be back soon, right now I just<br />
need some time with Cain. Assuming he still wants to come?" she looked<br />
at him. He nodded. "I strongly suggest we sit down and talk when I get<br />
back, I&#039;ll arrange for Catkin and Grizzel to take care of stuff if<br />
you&#039;re not ready... they did an excellent job while I was gone." She<br />
went over and hugged her cousin. "By the way, my parents wanted me to<br />
be like you." she whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>Having said that, she grabbed Cain&#039;s hand and ran off down the hall.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane stood, using the wall to pull herself up, and it took her a moment to stop trembling like a leaf. <i>No more running,</i> she promised herself. <i>No<br />
more being a coward. It&#039;s not even that Ilandra&#039;s disappointed, or<br />
whether Lysander would be, although that&#039;s bad enough. It&#039;s that, in<br />
all honesty, what she said was right, and <b>I&#039;m</b> dissappointed in myself, and that&#039;s the main problem.</i></p>
<p>With that thought, she set her shoulders and went back inside to discuss interrogating the prisoner.</p>
<p><i>((OOC: Yeah, she interrupted.))</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Right," said Abel, catching the look in Akane&#039;s eyes but deciding not<br />
to enquire.  "Nyano, did you say the faux-poisoner was being held<br />
in the dungeons?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"He&#039;s the only prisoner in there, he shouldn&#039;t be that hard to find. I<br />
left three guards there with him, so he should still be there. Let&#039;s<br />
go!"</p>
<p>With that, Nyano heads off towards the dungeons.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>As Akane turned to follow Nyano out, she caught Abel examining her with far too much insight for her liking. <i>I&#039;d<br />
forgotten how well they know me. A lot can be different in a century,<br />
sure, but some things don&#039;t ever change, regardless of time.</i> "Don&#039;t<br />
ask," she told him. "You probably don&#039;t want to know, and I probably<br />
don&#039;t want to answer - not unless you plan to get me drunk again when<br />
we&#039;re done with this," she finished as she headed after the Scoutmaster.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel stood and smiled for a moment as he watched Akane leave the room,<br />
wondering just how much of her and Ilandra&#039;s lives he didn&#039;t yet know<br />
about.  Then, after a brief shake of his head as if to dislodge<br />
awkward thoughts, he and Hugh followed the other two in the direction<br />
of the dungeons.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Nyano led Akane, Hugh and Abel deep into the heart of Castle Poppy,<br />
down staircase after staircase, until they were well underground and as<br />
far as anyone could figure not underneath the main body of the castle<br />
at all.</p>
<p>At the end of a dingy tunnel was a door, framed by two torches that<br />
illuminated it and two guards who were trying their very best to play<br />
cards.</p>
<p>They snapped to attention as the group approached, meaning that their<br />
next game would inevitably be 52-card Pick-up.  They saluted, and<br />
one of them unlocked the door and allowed the four visitors through.</p>
<p>From inside the room, sounds of crunching could be heard, each one<br />
followed by a slight whimper.  Abel grabbed one of the torches<br />
from the outside wall and stepped in, illuminating the interior of the<br />
cell.</p>
<p>In the corner, the faun was desperately trying to move whilst<br />
disturbing the floor as much as possible - an understandable endeavour,<br />
being as the floor was covered quite thickly with bones.  Each<br />
time the poor creature touched one, he let out a small fearful squeal.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane nodded slightly to the group, then approached the faun. <i>Let the games begin...</i></p>
<p>"Oh, you poor thing," she told it. "That&#039;s not a very nice place to put<br />
a guest!" she scolded the other three. "Listen, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s been a<br />
terrible misunderstanding. How about we take you somewhere nicer and<br />
let you sit down, then I&#039;ll ask a few questions and we&#039;ll get to the<br />
bottom of this in no time!" <font color="red">Akane rolls Cha + Empathy, difficulty 6 - 0 successes :/</font></p>

<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano glares at the prisoner, his boomerang shifting back to a full spear.</p>
<p>"There&#039;s been no misunderstanding. He was seen with the poison and he&#039;s<br />
confessed everything to me already. He knows that his only chance of<br />
seeing his family again is knowing something useful to our<br />
investigation. He&#039;ll answer all of our questions truthfully if I ask<br />
him to."</p>

<p>The faun virtually screams, backing right into the corner and pushing<br />
himself up against the stonework as fast and as far as he could, all<br />
the while unable to take his eyes off the glinting razor-sharp edge of<br />
Nyano&#039;s spear.</p>
<p>"...Yes..." he sobbed, in a voice most un-befitting a grown man.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p><i>Well, looks like we&#039;re in business,</i> Akane thought happily.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll be very happy to answer our questions and he knows that<br />
his willingness to cooperate will reflect well on him when it becomes<br />
time to decide what to do with him," Akane said pleasantly.</p>
<p>"Here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to do. We&#039;re going to tie your wrists - just<br />
so my friend the Scoutsmaster doesn&#039;t feel nervous, as he might react a<br />
bit rashly if he was," she continued with a discreet wink to Nyano,<br />
"Then we&#039;re going to take you to a nicer room and ask you a few<br />
questions. As long as you remain helpful, rest assured that no harm<br />
will come to you. If you&#039;re <i>very</i> helpful, we might even be able to arrange some dinner for you, from the food you <i>didn&#039;t</i><br />
&#039;poison&#039;, and maybe even some slightly nicer accomodation arrangements,<br />
until this is sorted out. Sound good?" she smiled at the faun.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Um, yes..." the faun sobbed again.  He proffered his wrists to<br />
Akane, glancing sideways at Nyano as he did so to check that he wasn&#039;t<br />
getting any closer.  Even though Nyano hadn&#039;t moved, the faun<br />
shuffled slightly away from him anyway.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"There there, stop crying," Akane patted the faun on the shoulder. <i>Wimp. Then again, he <b>has</b> been keeping company with bones all night.</i></p>
<p>She fetched a pair of handcuffs from the wall, and, after a moment of thought, a set of legcuffs as well. <i>If he earns his dinner, he&#039;ll also have earned the right to feed himself.</i><br />
Locking the cuffs around the faun&#039;s wrist, she clipped the second set<br />
onto her belt and hung both sets of keys around her neck. <i>Keys in pockets is just <b>asking</b> for trouble.</i></p>
<p>"Right," she turned to the others. "Have we got a non-dungeon-shaped<br />
secure room we can take our guest to? No bones, please, let&#039;s give him<br />
a chance to tell his side of the story."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Of course," Abel said.  "It&#039;s not as if our House is big enough to fill this old castle any more.  This way."</p>
<p>He beckoned and the group, faun included, trooped out of the<br />
cell.  The guards, halfway through picking their cards up, stood<br />
and saluted and dropped them all again.</p>
<p>They walked back through the long tunnel, up several flights of stairs,<br />
and back into the castle proper again.  Abel found a room quite<br />
high up in one of the towers that had a strong lock on the door, whilst<br />
inside was richly decorated and thick with dust.</p>
<p>"One of the old Dukes was quite paranoid," said Abel by way of an<br />
explanation.  "In his elderly years, he spent much of his time up<br />
here, convinced that everyone bar the one servant he trusted with the<br />
keys was out to kill him.  It turned out in the end that he&#039;d<br />
trusted the wrong man, but since then no-one&#039;s bothered to use this<br />
room for very much."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane lead the faun to a chair and sat down across from him. "I&#039;d like<br />
you to start at the beginning, please. You say you&#039;re innocent; so how<br />
did you wind up putting &#039;poison&#039; in our food? Anything at all you<br />
remember might be important, and of course, the more details you give<br />
us, the more we might become convinced of your honesty." <i>Now&#039;s no time to tell him it wasn&#039;t poison. Maybe afterwards...</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I...  I&#039;ve already told...  Well, I already told the scary<br />
spear-wielding, um, raccoon everything I know.  I&#039;m just...<br />
I&#039;m just a poor man, and I was out hunting to try and feed my<br />
family.  We were farmers, but...  But our village got caught<br />
up in the war, and most of us died, and then the soldiers came and<br />
burned our crops...</p>
<p>"Then, one day...  One day I met this Indigo man.  I think it<br />
was Indigo something-or-other.  I met him in the forest near home,<br />
and he told me that...  If I could do a job for him, then we&#039;d<br />
never starve again.  He gave me... precise instructions about what<br />
to do, and he gave me money and promised more when I returned to him.</p>
<p>"When the Poppies, um, that is to say, when you passed through an inn<br />
on your way back to the castle, I... let one of your horses out of the<br />
stable, and then, um, I took his place, looking properly like a horse<br />
of course, so I was ridden back here, and then turned back into this<br />
shape, and snuck into the kitchens, and I put the black stuff in the<br />
bottle in all the pots and pans just like the guy asked and then you<br />
found me and, um...</p>
<p>"And I&#039;m so sorry!" he wailed, bursting into tears again.  "I just...  I just needed the money..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Against her will, Akane felt slightly sorry for the poor faun. "The war&#039;s been hard on everyone," she said. <i>Maybe<br />
if he really is as innocent as he says, I could have a talk with<br />
Ilandra about accepting someone in his family - probably not him, given<br />
the givens - as a trainee healer. That&#039;d help keep them fed. But I&#039;d<br />
certainly have to discuss that with her first, it&#039;s a bit of a<br />
stretch...</i></p>
<p>"It looks like you don&#039;t remember much, and given how difficult this<br />
day must&#039;ve been for you, I don&#039;t blame you," she said soothingly. "I&#039;d<br />
like to try something. I&#039;m going to hypnotise you - put you in a bit of<br />
a sleepy trance, so that you can remember things better - and then ask<br />
you the same questions. Look into my eyes, please," she instructed the<br />
faun.</p>
<p>The human hypnotist that had taught her this trick favoured using a<br />
shiny object as a focus for the subject&#039;s vision, but she&#039;d found that<br />
yellow fox&#039;s eyes worked even better. <font color="red">Akane rolls Kenning + Manipulation (difficulty 5) to hypnotise the faun; 4 successes. OOC: Finally the dice like me!</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p><font color="red">Ian and I did this bit on MSN, otherwise it would probably have taken several more days of playing out this one day :P</font></p>
<p>The faun blinks a couple of times, then locks eye contact with<br />
Akane.  His eyes widen, then close slightly as his body sags into<br />
a daydream-like daze.</p>
<p>Akane eyes the faun. <i>Crap, I don&#039;t know his name...</i> she thought. "What is your name?"</p>
<p>"...Albert..." murmurs the faun.</p>
<p>"Right, Albert. I&#039;d like you to think back to when you first met the<br />
person called Indigo. You&#039;re walking through the forest. What happens?"</p>
<p>"I... I started tracking something that I thought was a wild animal,<br />
but as I got closer I realised it was a person. I approached slowly,<br />
and the man was stood in a clearing, looking right at me and smiling..."</p>
<p>"Tell me what this man looked like; describe his physical appearance,<br />
his mannerisms, and anything else about him that might be distinctive."</p>
<p>"He was tall, with brown hair poking out from under a blue beret.<br />
He was a noble, I could tell that for sure, though he wore plain<br />
clothes.  His chin was kind of stubbley."</p>
<p>"He looked Sidhe then? Tell me what happened next. How did he approach<br />
you, and what were your thoughts on hearing his proposal?"</p>
<p>"He called me by name, and ordered me to go up to him, and I&#039;m not sure<br />
why but I obeyed him.  He knew why I was hunting; knew what<br />
happened to my family.  He gave me money, gold coins, then told me<br />
to listen.  He told me that if I did this job for him, he&#039;d give<br />
me so much money that we&#039;d never starve again..."</p>
<p>"And what did this job entail, Albert?"</p>
<p>"He gave me the bottle, told me exactly how to get to the castle and<br />
what to do when I was there - to put a drop from the bottle into<br />
everything in the kitchens."</p>
<p>"Did you believe the contents of the bottle were going to harm people, Albert?"</p>
<p>"It&#039;d be revenge, he said...  Against the people who burned our fields."</p>
<p>"So you believed you were getting back at the people who made you starve?"</p>
<p>"Yes...  It&#039;s the money I really wanted, but if I could... help to<br />
redress the balance then I thought that was another reason to accept."</p>
<p>"Did House Poppy burn your fields, Albert? Was it them you wanted to get back at?"</p>
<p>"I don&#039;t know which House it was, only that they were allies of the Red<br />
Rose.  The stranger, he said that...  That there would be<br />
many of them here tonight."</p>
<p>"After everything that&#039;s happened to you, assuming you weren&#039;t trying<br />
to feed your family, would you still try to hurt people for revenge?"</p>
<p>"No, never...  It was the money I wanted, and I was prepared to do<br />
any job to get money, but this... just happened to be a job I didn&#039;t<br />
disagree with..."</p>
<p>"If House Poppy or their allies made sure you and your family didn&#039;t go hungry, would you be loyal to them?"</p>
<p>"I&#039;d do... anything to stop us starving..."</p>
<p>"What if I told you the people you poisoned didn&#039;t have anything to do<br />
with your family&#039;s livelihood being destroyed? How would that make you<br />
feel about your actions?"</p>
<p>"I&#039;d feel more guilty, but...  I&#039;d still have done the job.<br />
Morality is less important to... to the poor, and the hungry."</p>
<p><i>The problem is that they&#039;re poor and hungry in the first place,</i> Akane thought with a sigh. <i>I&#039;ll<br />
have to speak to Ilandra; we don&#039;t dare let him go free while his<br />
family&#039;s starving. The thing that worries me is...how many more like<br />
him are there?</i> "Tell me," she asked the faun, "How many people like you are there? How much...did the war destroy?"</p>
<p>"From my village there are... maybe six left alive.  Once, there<br />
were nearly a hundred.  In other villages, who knows.  The<br />
nobles&#039; games have cost the world so much."</p>
<p>"I&#039;m sorry for your loss, Albert," Akane said - and meant it. "Back to<br />
my earlier questions - did Indigo say he&#039;d contact you again after the<br />
job was done? How was he going to give you the money that would<br />
guarantee your family&#039;s livelihood?"</p>
<p>"He said that he&#039;d know if I was successful and that... he&#039;d meet me in the same place, two days hence at sunset."</p>
<p>"Albert, if we guaranteed your family would have food and shelter, would you meet this man again...and report to us?"</p>
<p>"He&#039;d... know I failed.  I don&#039;t know what he&#039;d do, and I don&#039;t want to find out..."</p>
<p>"Technically, you didn&#039;t fail - you did put the contents of the bottle<br />
into our food, and you can tell him so. What if we had someone in the<br />
woods near you to protect you if something went wrong?" Akane knew<br />
information was the only weapon they had at this point, and they needed<br />
it badly - even if it meant accompanying the faun herself.</p>
<p>"I don&#039;t know if... if I&#039;ve failed, whether he&#039;ll even come, or whether<br />
he&#039;ll just send people to kill me.  And it would be stupid for<br />
your people to risk themselves to protect... someone like me."</p>
<p>"Someone like you? What do you mean by that, Albert?"</p>
<p>"I... I tried to kill you.  What would it matter to you if I... died...?"</p>
<p>"Because what you did was wrong, but your need was dire. Because if<br />
you&#039;re right about the nobles having lost the goodwill of the<br />
commoners, than any one of you could be our enemy, and we need to<br />
change that. Because I believe the reason nobles exist is to look after<br />
their people," Akane responded.</p>
<p>"Then if there is a noble who would... look after me, and my family, I... would do anything for them."</p>
<p><i>I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m doing this,</i> Akane thought to herself, <i>The<br />
last thing I wanted was...responsibility. But someone has to do it; for<br />
him and for everybody like him. I&#039;ve been a coward; maybe something<br />
like this is what it will take for me to change.</i></p>
<p>"I&#039;ll look after you," she promised him. "For now you&#039;re going to go to<br />
sleep," she told the Faun, "And you&#039;ll wake up again when I tell you<br />
to." She turned to the others. "We need a plan," she informed them. "I<br />
have some ideas, but I&#039;d like to hear yours too."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Once Nyano was sure the faun was properly asleep he turns to Akane. His fur standing on end in rage.</p>
<p>"Going to that meeting was the stupidest idea I&#039;ve ever heard! This<br />
idiot wasn&#039;t meant to succeed. Didn&#039;t you notice that he was told the<br />
entire plan in minute detail, up to the point where he was supposed to<br />
get out after putting poison into food in a busy kitchen SURROUNDED BY<br />
WITNESSES! They neglected to give him an escape plan, they didn&#039;t even<br />
tell him to wear a disguise.</p>
<p>HE WAS MEANT TO BE CAUGHT AND TELL US THIS!"</p>
<p>Nyano starts to breath again.</p>
<p>"Anyone who goes to that meeting is either dead or captured.</p>
<p>I will not allow my men to be ordered to do something this stupid.<br />
They&#039;ve just gotten us home and gotten us through some incredibly<br />
dangerous situations. They deserve a rest and some light duty.</p>
<p>For some of them the thought of the reward they would get when we got<br />
here has been the only thought that sustained them when yet another<br />
monstrosity with 15 mouths leaps from the underbrush and  tries to<br />
kill them. I intend to see they live to enjoy that pay.</p>
<p>So if you&#039;re going, you&#039;re doing it without either military or scout<br />
support. You&#039;ll have to take it up with the kitchens about getting your<br />
final dinner, because that&#039;s about all we can do for you.</p>
<p>My opinion is that this faun should be tried by the duchess Regara as a<br />
poisoner, and his sentence should be left to her. I intend to request<br />
that he and his family become indentured servants to my household,<br />
where I will see that they are fed and kept out of mischief for the<br />
rest of their days.</p>
<p>And as for what to do with Indigo something, I think if we don&#039;t bite<br />
this time, he&#039;ll either send something else to try us in the next<br />
month, or he&#039;ll leave us alone.</p>
<p>If it&#039;s the first, perhaps it&#039;ll be less well thought out that this<br />
time, and we can use it to get a little more information on our<br />
opponent, like at the very least a corroboration of his description.<br />
Perhaps if we think about it, we can create some sort of obvious<br />
weakness that we can trick him to exploit. Maybe another big party or<br />
something simillar, some chance that he&#039;s not going to be able to pass<br />
up on. But, the final say on any plan goes to the duchess.</p>
<p>That&#039;s why we have a duchess, to stop us making up hare brained plans without consulting someone sensible!"</p>
<p>Finally finishing his rant Nyano sits back on his heels to see the effect on his audience.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane sighed. "I never meant to imply that I would commandeer your men<br />
into this without your consent. I apologise," she told Nyano. "I was<br />
simply thinking that, if there are enough people there, we might be<br />
able to capture this Indigo before he gets up to more mischief.</p>
<p>"Nor did I mean to imply that I was going to single-handedly make any<br />
decisions about his future; I just meant for him to give us as much<br />
information as possible about his state of mind so that we can judge<br />
whether it&#039;s safe to let him go. After all, he couldn&#039;t possibly have<br />
done us harm, even if he intended to.</p>
<p>"I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair that his family be indentured, though - after<br />
all, they didn&#039;t know anything about this, and didn&#039;t have any part in<br />
his actions. By &#039;looking after him&#039;, I meant that I was going to<br />
consult Ilandra about giving the rest of his family positions as<br />
apprentice healers, where they will be looked after until they finish<br />
their training, and, should they decide to work in the hospital<br />
afterwards, receive wages as well.</p>
<p>"Maybe you&#039;re right about going after Indigo being a phenomenally<br />
stupid idea. I&#039;m just not sure what choice we have. Whether this man<br />
was working with the Committee or some other plot is afoot, whatever it<br />
is he wants from us, as you said, he&#039;ll keep trying, and <i>we will never see it coming</i>.<br />
Next time he will be better prepared. Next time we may not notice the<br />
knife until it&#039;s been stuck in our back. Whatever&#039;s going on, I don&#039;t<br />
think they&#039;re the kind to give up.</p>
<p>"If we do go after him, we&#039;ll know the time and place of the encounter;<br />
we&#039;ll be able to look over the ground he&#039;s chosen; we&#039;ll be able to lay<br />
traps. We might be able to get some idea <i>what the hell is going on</i>, because until then, we&#039;re running blind; and I&#039;m afraid that makes us vulnerable."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"Doing anything based only on information he knows we have is worse<br />
that running blind. House poppy has no resources to spare on preparing<br />
an ambush for Indigo, and even if we did, I wouldn&#039;t want to send them<br />
into what is very likely to be a counter ambush.</p>
<p>The trick is to get more information, I think they are going to attack<br />
us again, but the question we have to ask is, what do we know about<br />
them from the way they&#039;ve attacked already?</p>
<p>What we know is that they want either to poison a whole load of people,<br />
most of whom are not us, or they want to capture some of our people,<br />
probably for political gain.</p>
<p>We can use that to set a trap on our ground, theres no need to risk<br />
resources on their ground. I&#039;m pretty sure, given what he told Albert,<br />
that the man is one of the White who isn&#039;t stupid enough to pass of a<br />
chance at poisoning a whole load of red nobles at no risk to himself.</p>
<p>He already knew everything about Albert&#039;s circumstances at the time<br />
they met, and he gave a detailed set of instructions on the insertion.<br />
That means he&#039;s the type to make careful plans and consider all the<br />
alternatives. The place where he met Albert is almost certainly trapped<br />
already, if it&#039;s not it&#039;s only because the traps would get in the way<br />
of the full company of White Rose troops that are hiding in the trees.</p>
<p>I think we should set a trap for him instead, that&#039;s the best way to<br />
find out &#039;what the hell is going on&#039; as you put it. Arn&#039;t Duchess<br />
Honeysuckle and Prince Cain going to get married?</p>
<p>Wouldn&#039;t either their wedding or their engagment party be a party as<br />
big as this one? If we made lots of noise about this party, I bet<br />
Indigo wouldn&#039;t be able to resist the opportunity to stick his knife in<br />
there.</p>
<p>Then since we&#039;re expecting it, we can set it up so we catch his agent.<br />
I have lots of ideas on how to do that, but that can wait till later,<br />
and anyway, I still think that we shouldn&#039;t make any plans at all until<br />
we&#039;ve told Duchess Regara."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"They&#039;re getting married, yes," Akane nodded. "But first they decided<br />
to go on vacation. My cousin said she&#039;d be back in a week, but it may<br />
take them longer, I have no idea. I&#039;m not sure the man was a White<br />
Rose, though - given everything that&#039;s happened tonight, it seems like<br />
the timing is just too good for this to have nothing to do with the<br />
Black Rose Committee, whatever <i>they</i> are. Nyano, they weren&#039;t trying to &#039;poison a whole lot of people&#039;, because it <i>wasn&#039;t poison</i>,<br />
so what would a White have to gain by that? I don&#039;t think that Indigo<br />
would come himself; he didn&#039;t this time, and as we&#039;ve seen, he doesn&#039;t<br />
give his pawns too much information.</p>
<p>"Your argument is good, though; if you think we can set a better trap<br />
at another time, then let&#039;s do it your way," she said. "However, please<br />
do remember that it wasn&#039;t only Poppies that were in danger tonight,<br />
although it did happen on your lands and in your castle." <i>I&#039;m<br />
not in charge here, and I can&#039;t have it both ways - I don&#039;t want<br />
authority, and that means acknowledging that it&#039;s not my place to<br />
judge. But I made the man a promise...</i></p>
<p>"The man&#039;s family have nothing to do with it, though, and I made him a<br />
promise. I&#039;m going to take them in, and if Ilandra says otherwise when<br />
she returns, then I&#039;ll find a way to make sure they&#039;re taken care of<br />
without using Honeysuckle resources."</p>
<p><i>Push comes to shove, I send them to the human world to live off my<br />
bank accounts - I&#039;m certainly not poor, given I&#039;ve been working for a<br />
century - and when I have the time, train them to survive there. That<br />
way, they&#039;ll always be able to get by, even if I can&#039;t do anything for<br />
them in Faerie.</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"We don&#039;t need to hold the party in the next week, I was thinking more<br />
like two months. We&#039;d announce it in about two weeks. There won&#039;t be<br />
any more attacks for at least a week, since Indigo won&#039;t know if this<br />
plan succeeded or not for another day at least, and then he&#039;ll have to<br />
go organise his second attack.</p>
<p>As for why he&#039;s probably a white rose, think about what the poison jar<br />
said. It claimed that another marmite jar &#039;Rodney&#039; had told it that<br />
Indigo had filled a simillar jar with poison, but that our jar itself<br />
is not poisoned, it is an ordinary jar of marmite.</p>
<p>Clearly this means that there were at least two jars, at least one of<br />
which was poisoned and one of which was not. At least one jar was<br />
marked as poison. I suspect poor Indigo simply marked the wrong jar. By<br />
the fact that he filled one jar with poison, that he was going to use<br />
to kill a whole load of people in a party, we can assume that he did<br />
infact want to kill the partygoers.</p>
<p>As for why it&#039;s a white. It&#039;s clearly not a Red, unless it&#039;s a traitor.<br />
You don&#039;t try and indiscriminatly poison a whole bunch of people on<br />
your own side if you believe in them. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a black rose.<br />
The only thing linking it with them is the timing, it happened at the<br />
same party that Elaine crashed. In case you hadn&#039;t noticed, this is<br />
both the only opportunity for someone to come and openly make a<br />
proposal to House Poppy in front of the collected nobles of the Reds,<br />
and the only opportunity to poison a whole load of Red nobles in our<br />
lands.</p>
<p>Besides, if we&#039;d accepted the Black Rose proposal or even been a little<br />
warmer towards it Elayne would have been honour bound to stay and enjoy<br />
the party. No one would trust an alliance with an envoy who didn&#039;t even<br />
do us the honour of staying at our party once she&#039;d gone to all the<br />
trouble of coming to it. She&#039;d have been given a place at the head<br />
table, and been expected to talk to the nobles of the other houses who<br />
were present in an attempt to convince them.</p>
<p>The important point is, she would have been expected to eat the food.</p>
<p>Whoever she is, you could tell from her bearing that she wasn&#039;t just<br />
some expendable messenger. She&#039;s important enough that the Black Rose<br />
wouldn&#039;t want her poisoned. Even if she had taken some kind of<br />
antidote, if she had survived and a lot of other nobles hadn&#039;t, then<br />
word would spread around the Reds pretty quickly that this had<br />
happened. It wouldn&#039;t take long for those rumours to start<br />
linking the Black Roses for the poisoning, and then they&#039;d stir up the<br />
hatred of anyone who lost a family member or liege lord to the incident.</p>
<p>There is no way the black rose could have wanted to poison such a large<br />
group of important people shortly after making an offer of alliance to<br />
their hosts. It&#039;s political suicide, compounded by political throwing<br />
your toys out of your pram. Frankly the best way to scupper the Black<br />
Rose&#039;s plans would be to poison three quarters of the people at this<br />
party shortly after they&#039;ve made their proposal. Nothing would hurt<br />
them more.</p>
<p>He has to be a White, theres no one else who has a serious motive.</p>
<p>On the other point, letting that idiot&#039;s family go free is a really bad<br />
idea. Whatever happens he&#039;s going to be sentenced to death, I&#039;ll do my<br />
best to make the sentence commuted to something more preferable, but<br />
it&#039;ll still officially be death. He confessed to the head of the guard,<br />
with witnesses after being caught holding the poison bottle.</p>
<p>His family don&#039;t like the reds as it is, I can guarantee that when word<br />
gets back to them, and Indigo will make sure it does, that they&#039;re<br />
going to really really hate us, and I bet Indigo will use that to use<br />
them to get at us, and they&#039;ll probably die in the attempt. As they are<br />
they&#039;re a vulnerability. As serfs on my land, I can protect them. Can<br />
you say the same?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"You&#039;re right, a death sentence would cause a great deal of ill feeling<br />
towards the Poppies, given the man was trying to feed his starving<br />
family. So will indenturing innocent peasants. Showing mercy, on the<br />
other hand, would probably gain a lot more political advantage.</p>
<p>"I am willing to protect them without taking away their freedom. We can<br />
offer the children training in a profession, a future career. If their<br />
livelihood depends on me and mine, I doubt they will want to kill us -<br />
especially given that it won&#039;t be us who will decide Albert&#039;s fate.</p>
<p>"I made him a promise; if it turns out to be a promise to a condemned<br />
man, it&#039;s all the more important that I keep it. His family is in my<br />
care, because, for a start, they&#039;re they&#039;re not on trial for anything,<br />
and they&#039;re free commoners, and as such, you don&#039;t get to decide what<br />
to do with them. I don&#039;t either. I will ask them to come with me, and<br />
it will be their choice if they do so or not.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m willing to let who is responsible for the poisoning is rest, for now." <i>Although<br />
I&#039;m still convinced this is somehow all connected to the Black Roses,<br />
and I will damn well prove it in good time, there&#039;s absolutely no sense<br />
in making an enemy of Nyano, especially if he does come up with a<br />
viable plan. We don&#039;t need infighting right now.</i></p>
<p>"However, if we&#039;re going to go with your plan, <i>I</i> have a question for <i>you</i><br />
- why is it that you refuse to endanger your scouts, but you&#039;re<br />
perfectly willing to lay a trap with my Duchess and your Prince as<br />
bait?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"His family are free commoners? Judging from his desperation and<br />
naievety I suspect his family are serfs. Obviously if they are free<br />
commoners then they can&#039;t be made indentured servants, but I find it<br />
highly unlikely that they&#039;re free commoners. They almost certainly<br />
belong to some noble or another, and that noble has clearly deserted<br />
them in their time of need, an injustice I intend to rebalance.</p>
<p>If you do try and take them under your care, I&#039;d still be worried that<br />
Indigo is going to take them under his protection before, or possibly<br />
after you get to them.</p>
<p>I&#039;m still not seeing how Albert&#039;s sentence can formally be anything but<br />
death. Most of the nobles in the other room think he actually<br />
sucessfully poisoned them. If we don&#039;t sentence him to death then we&#039;d<br />
risk slighting half of the noble houses in the Reds. It&#039;s embarrasing<br />
enough that this happened at all, letting the culprit off with a slap<br />
on the wrist would add insult to injury, and if his family are<br />
technically someone&#039;s property the only way we&#039;d be able to protect<br />
them is to claim them under law.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with commuting a death sentence to something<br />
else in this situation. Death commuted to indentured servitute is still<br />
the best option for him.</p>
<p>If his family are free commoners, and you offer them a place in your<br />
hospital, what are you going to do to stop Indigo from turning them<br />
into his spies and agents? You&#039;d have to watch them all the time, in<br />
reality they&#039;d have no freedom at all. That&#039;s worse than my option,<br />
you&#039;re telling them that they&#039;re free, but  secretly keeping them<br />
under guard.</p>
<p>Also, whatever gave you the idea that Cain and Illandra are the bait?<br />
Theres no good reason for anyone to attack them during the wedding.<br />
There&#039;s little political advantage, and it&#039;s obvious that they&#039;re going<br />
to be heavily guarded with an entire hospital of fae waiting to treat<br />
them if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>They&#039;re not the bait at all, the guests are the bait. Since the guests<br />
will know that one of our parties ended in a poisoning, they&#039;ll already<br />
be warned of the danger. By turning up, they&#039;ve already given<br />
permission to be used as bait. Besides which, I&#039;m convinced that going<br />
to deal with Indigo on his terms is as stupid as suicide. That&#039;s why<br />
I&#039;m not risking my men on it.</p>
<p>I think that bringing one of his agents to our turf is much less risky,<br />
so I don&#039;t mind the operation. Besides, you think my men arn&#039;t going to<br />
be in danger in this plan? They&#039;re our only military force, they&#039;re<br />
going to have their hands very full with organising the defence. It&#039;s<br />
not like I&#039;m cosseting them away from all danger."</p>

<p><i>((OOC: her mind went to Cain and Ilandra as bait because she&#039;s paranoid and very protective of Ilandra :P))</i></p>
<p>"Albert&#039;s death could be avoided by swearing anyone who saw you capture<br />
him to secrecy if they&#039;re house Poppy vassals, and declaring that no<br />
one was caught. Or by saying he was put to death, and smuggling him<br />
out. Or by, I don&#039;t know, telling the nobles the truth? It seems like<br />
that&#039;s the best option for him, rather than condemning him for a crime<br />
he did not commit.</p>
<p>"I assure you that if his family are threatened, or threaten me, I will<br />
reconsider your proposal to lok after them. Until then, though, I do<br />
not see how taking away their freedom will &#039;balance&#039; any wrongs done to<br />
them, only perpetuate the injustice; if their lord abandoned them, then<br />
they are free now if they weren&#039;t before. They are not stray dogs, they<br />
do not owe allegiance to the first noble who decides to claim them<br />
(which is why I plan to offer them a choice) anymore than they owe<br />
allegiance to the lord who betrayed them.</p>
<p>"In the hospital they <i>will</i> be watched, not because I<br />
decreed it so, but because there are multiple staff members working at<br />
all hours, and the nature of the job is so delicate that anything amiss<br />
would soon be spotted. As you said about my cousin and her fiancee,<br />
they&#039;ll be heavily guarded with an entire hospital wing of Fae ready to<br />
sedate them if something goes wrong!</p>
<p>"I worried that Cain and Ilandra might be bait because, as Duchess<br />
Honeysuckle and her Duke-to-be, they are responsible for the only<br />
hospital in Faerie. Elaine of the Black Rose was fairly open regarding<br />
her feeling that the hospital should be closed that. I do not find it<br />
implausible to believe they may be threatened. I am happy to hear that<br />
this was not your intention."</p>

<p><b>Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</b></p>
<p>Hugh snorted and contrived to indicate that he hadn&#039;t just been falling<br />

<p>"I&#039;ll just ... I&#039;ll just go and see what that was. You all seem to have<br />

noodles fell unheeded to the floor behind him.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Deeply involved in the discussion Nyano barely noticed the strangeness that happened around him.</p>
<p>He quickly registered to him that Hugh was dealing with it, so continued on with his train of thought.</p>
<p>"You can&#039;t swear the entire kitchens to secrecy! They&#039;re servants: they<br />
gossip! By now the entire castle knows that I&#039;ve clapped him in chains<br />
and taken him to the dungeon.</p>
<p>If we claim that I killed him out of hand, people will think that we&#039;re<br />
stupid for not questioning him properly, and cruel for not having a<br />
proper trial. They&#039;ll want to see him cross examined in front of them,<br />
or at least to think that they had the opportunity. If we claim he was<br />
killed, they&#039;ll want to see the body.</p>
<p>He claimed to all four of us that he had no compunctions about doing<br />
what he was asked to. As far as everyone but we four and Gustaffsen<br />
know, he successfully poisoned everybody, and house Honeysuckle saved<br />
them. That&#039;s a good position, there&#039;s no good reason to throw it away.</p>
<p>The most important thing is we don&#039;t have the authority to decide what to do with him. That&#039;s duchess Regara&#039;s privilege.</p>
<p>I still don&#039;t think that there is much chance that his family had any<br />
freedom to start with. They&#039;re clearly serfs. You&#039;ve spent so much time<br />
with humans that you&#039;ve forgotten how things work amongst your own<br />
people.</p>
<p>Even if their lord has abandoned them, they&#039;ve never had to fend for<br />
themselves, they don&#039;t know how. For their last 10,000 lifetimes<br />
they&#039;ve been having nobles around to tell them what to do and look<br />
after them in difficult times.</p>
<p>You can&#039;t expect them to look after themselves. If ask them to join<br />
house Honeysuckle, whose duchess is about to marry a prince of house<br />
Poppy, I can guarantee that one of them will consider accepting, at<br />
least two will dither, one will run off into the wilds and one will<br />
dedicate her life to destroying everything that is dear to the people<br />
that killed her father. We&#039;re faeries, our passions run high and none<br />
of us can resist a good story.</p>
<p>You&#039;re going to tear that family apart. I&#039;m offering to keep them all<br />
together and in the style they are accustomed to, working my land as my<br />
serfs. I&#039;ll look after them, make sure they&#039;re fed and clothed and that<br />
they&#039;re happy. Most importantly, I&#039;ll make sure that they don&#039;t have to<br />
make any difficult or painful decisions for themselves. That&#039;s what<br />

<p><font color="red">Yet another MSN-post. Eedjit Akane and her overblown sense of compassion and responsibility.... Hehehe.</font></p>
<p>As Nyano left the room, Akane closed her eyes and rubbed her forehead.<br />
This probably wasn&#039;t going to turn out good either way... "Albert, wake<br />
up."</p>
<p>Albert stirred almost trance-like into consciousness, the hypnotism still having a profound affect on him.</p>
<p>Akane shook Albert gently. "Hey, snap out of it. I... Nyano has gone to<br />
talk to the Duchess about you. He&#039;s hoping to get your sentence<br />
commuted..."</p>
<p>"Good..." murmured the faun, still with his eyes closed and apparently also with his brain unwired.  "What... happened...?"</p>
<p>"Nyano wants to move your family to his estates. If everything goes<br />
well, you too. I&#039;m just worried...Regara&#039;s known for her temper. The<br />
thing is, well, it&#039;s not going to be new to you that people get used as<br />
pawns all the time, from the smallest to the mightiest. I wanted to<br />
offer you a choice. If you want...I&#039;ll fight for your family to come to<br />
the Honeysuckle estates instead."</p>
<p>"Which Lord we serve is... your business, not mine.  I only want... us... to survive."</p>
<p>"I&#039;m asking you because I thought you had the right to a choice.<br />
Honeysuckle treats its people well. Nyano wants to indenture your<br />
family so that...you don&#039;t try for revenge. I guess it doesn&#039;t seem<br />
fair to me that your family suffer for a choice you alone made...and it<br />
doesn&#039;t seem fair that, if Nyano doesn&#039;t convince Regara, you...don&#039;t<br />
see it coming."</p>
<p>"Then I suppose... I will choose... House Honeysuckle.  You seem... a good person, while... this Regara sounds scary."</p>
<p>Akane nodded. "I promise, I&#039;ll take care of them. Hopefully you too. My<br />
Duchess and Regara&#039;s son are to be married - hopefully she can  be<br />
convinced to entrust you to Honeysuckle custody. We lost a lot in the<br />
war too. There&#039;s many lands without people to tend them, and there&#039;s<br />
always work in the hospital. Maybe you&#039;ll get to start over."</p>
<p>"I... hope so.  But... before I can think of things like<br />
that...  I must gather my family.  I can&#039;t... be safe myself<br />
until they are too."<br />
Akane nodded. "Look, whatever Regara decides about you...I&#039;ll find them."</p>
<p>"Thank... you."</p>
<p>"If things go well, we&#039;ll go together and bring them to our lands.<br />
If...they don&#039;t, where do I find them and what do you want me to tell<br />
them?"</p>
<p>"We live outside a village...  What used to be a village, called<br />
Waterford, two days&#039; ride Northwest of here...  in Hyacinth<br />
lands.  Tell them only that... they must come quickly.  I<br />
fear what may happen to them if they are alone for long."</p>
<p>"I&#039;ll go tomorrow," she promised.</p>
<p>Abel tapped Akane on the shoulder and whispered in her ear. "I realise<br />
you have not been back in Faerie long," said Abel, "so I am assuming<br />
you are not aware of the progress of the war.  Hyacinth land is<br />
somewhat... contested at present."</p>
<p>Akane groaned at Abel&#039;s words. "Figures. Would your mother lend me a<br />
few guards? After all, if she wants to take Albert&#039;s family into<br />
custody, whether that be Nyano&#039;s or mine...then she has to fetch them."</p>
<p>"I suspect, knowing my mother, she would make it a condition of your<br />
obtaining custody that Honeysuckle resources are used to find the<br />
family.  If they were to serve a Poppy, she may agree to use Poppy<br />
troops, but bear in mind her decision would be strongly influenced by<br />
that of the head of the military - Nyano."</p>
<p>"I guess Nyano and I will have to come to some kind of understanding<br />
then. At least, if she does agree to commute Albert&#039;s sentence, then I<br />
find it unlikely that they&#039;ll have a reason to look for revenge," Akane<br />
whispered back to Abel.</p>
<p>"Do you  have any idea about where the armies on the lands have been recently?"</p>
<p>"As we have been travelling, I am afraid we have only received the<br />
vaguest of reports.  The Hyacinth kingdom is by and large hilly<br />
and wooded, meaning that fighting there is neither quick nor<br />
easy.  If the territory is sufficiently important to the Reds&#039;<br />
strategy, fighting may be taking place all over the kingdom for some<br />
time."</p>
<p>"Will they respect Honeysuckle neutrality? Especially given the<br />
Honeysuckle&#039;s Duchess is about to be married to a Red Rose ally...?"</p>
<p>"The armies will.  If Albert here is representative of the mood of<br />
the peasantry, I think mugging will be the greater danger."</p>
<p>Akane sighed. "Do they mug small foxes sneaking through the woods, and<br />
possibly leading a peasant family with nothing of value back out?"<br />
Akane turned to Albert. "Do you have something of yours, a token that<br />
you could give me? Something that would make your family inclined to<br />
follow a fox for no good reason."</p>
<p>Albert looked heartbroken for a moment; affected greatly by some inner<br />
turmoil. Eventually, he reached into his pocket and produced an ornate<br />
gold pocket watch. "Take this, and find my family," he said.<br />
"But.. please return with both, or else... I will have nothing left."</p>
<p>Akane nodded and covered Albert&#039;s hand with hers. "Hopefully as<br />
something that small, I can sneak in and out without being spotted<br />
unless I want to be, and your family will follow me. If somebody tries<br />
to pull something, then..." she fingered the gun under her coat. She<br />
had avoided using it or mentioning it, but as a last resort...it wasn&#039;t<br />
cold iron, but it was a good second best.</p>
<p>Albert nodded, saying nothing, his eyes wide and empty.</p>
