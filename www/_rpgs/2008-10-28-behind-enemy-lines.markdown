<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The Intercontinental Ballistic Marrow reached the apex of its<br />
trajectory, high in the sky above Fairyland.  Down below, the<br />
cloud-speckled landscape stretched without end from horizon to horizon,<br />
as if the world stretched on forever.  From this high, there were<br />
no castles, no towns and villages; even the greatest of the cities was<br />
but a speck.  Mountains and forests, lakes and seas, an infinity<br />
of the wild.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, the marrow tilted further and further down, picking<br />
up speed alarmingly with every passing second.  It dropped like a<br />
stone through minute after minute of roaring sky, toward a tiny area of<br />
what looked like grassy land, close to the very centre of Fairyland.</p>
<p>With an audible "whumph", the marrow hit the cloudbank and all was white for seconds that seemed like hours.</p>
<p>When the marrow finally made it out of the other side of the clouds,<br />
the area it was aiming for loomed large and immediate.  For the<br />
brief moment of normality, the pilots of the ICBM could see, away in<br />
the distance, two towers jutting from the ground like needles - one<br />
tall and spindly, marble and glass, the very image of a fairytale; the<br />
other jagged and crystalline, as if the sky had cried an obsidian tear.</p>
<p>Then the normality ended.  The ground flashed red, the sky flashed<br />
red, and the ICBM flew backwards as if it were a shuttlecock in a game<br />
of the widely-renouned Invisible Giant Badminton.</p>
<p>In flames, its vitamin-rich pilots no longer conscious, the marrow<br />
crashed into a forest many miles from the land that the towers occupied.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The sun was lower in the sky by the time the occupants of the now<br />
char-grilled craft came to.  It shone on them, just barely, though<br />
the gap in the forest canopy through which they had made their<br />
entry.  No signs of life were visible, or audible, around the<br />
crater...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>...  Quickly and quietly the V Team organised themselves removing<br />
their vital equipment from the Drop Chip&#8217;s storage holds.  They<br />
had everything they needed for a lengthy stay in the wylds of Fairy,<br />
Camping equipment, Babybio plant food, survival kits, maps, anything a<br />
secret and stealthy Vegetable could dream of needing.  With their<br />
equipment packed readied for travel they quickly set off into the<br />
surrounding forests, they needed someplace to set up base camp but more<br />
importantly they needed to leave the vasinity of the landing site and<br />
be far away from it when and if anything came to investigate it.</p>
<p>As the V Team stealthily moved into the night a gentle hissing and<br />
squelching noise wafted into the night along with the smell of rotten<br />
vegetables as the decomposition bomb embedded in the craft detonated<br />
leaving no evidence of what had caused the crater.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>A fluttering and a rustling of leaves high above the V-Team stopped<br />
them in their tracks.  From high above, a set of beady black eyes<br />
gazed down, scanning the forest floor in case anything tasty lay<br />
below...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>&#8230;As soon as the V-Team perceived the fluttering aeons of ingrained instinct took over and evasive action was taken&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;as the beady eye scanned the forest floor its gazed passed over<br />
rotting leaves, strands of grass, an abandoned sardines tin and a small<br />
pile of vegetable matter growing in the deep fertile loam.  Then<br />
some movement caught its eye, a small worm was squirming about close by<br />
the sardine tin and what appeared to be a strange white stalky plant.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The bird landed swiftly, and with two brisk hops it was on the worm and devouring it.</p>
<p>All the while it was eating, its eyes scanned the forest around it, but<br />
saw nothing.  Except...  Except something that it had never<br />
seen before.  Cautiously, the bird hopped over to the white stalk<br />
and tilted its head back and forth.  When that examination failed<br />
to shed any light on the matter, it pecked it a few times, took a step<br />
back and then a step forward, then grabbed the top and <i>pulled</i>...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>&#8230;As the bird pulled a spindly white arm appeared from nowhere and<br />
punched it square between the eyes.  With a loud indignant squawk<br />
the bird jumped backwards.  Then having appeared to have decided<br />
to find less offensive pastimes it took off into the trees&#8230;</p>
<p>Whilst the bird flew off into the canopy the V-team started to emerge<br />
from their loamy hiding places and brush themselves down.  Once<br />
they were all present and accounted for, the Aubergine had to be<br />
forcibly dug out of its hiding place, the lead potatoes signalled for<br />
them to continue and they headed out deeper into the forest.  As<br />
they moved out the Cauliflower floret reached into its sardine tin of<br />
goodies and pulled out what appeared to be a small remote<br />
control.  Then wearing a smug expression it pressed one of the<br />
buttons&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; High above in the canopy there was loud popping sound and a mysterious shower of black feathers began to fall.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Up above, the forest became thick with the squawking alarms of birds of<br />
all shapes and sizes, fleeing in ever expanding circles from the<br />
detonation site.</p>
<p>Down below, the vegetables were finding their progress remarkably less impeded by the wildlife as the sun sank on into evening.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Eventually it was deemed that the V-Team had reached a safe enough<br />
distance from the landing site for them to set up camp for the<br />
night.  Deciding they had to find somewhere safe to bunk down for<br />
the night a perfect site was located by the simple means of letting go<br />
of the aubergine and pretending to look the other way; before following<br />
the fleeing vegetable directly too the hardest to find hiding place in<br />
the vicinity.  A small hollow underneath the roots of an ancient<br />
oak tree.  Once found they started to make the place more homely<br />
by laying out their grow bags whilst the Sprouts set up a secured<br />
perimeter.</p>
<p>Whist the hustle and bustle of the encampment got under way the two<br />
lead potatoes started to scrape away a small patch of dirt and to<br />
carefully insert a black and red brown speckled bean; before covering<br />
it over and spraying it with an oddly glowing liquid.  This done<br />
they set looked over the watch rota organised by the Sprouts, amended<br />
it slightly before the V-Team turned in for the night.</p>
<p>[<font>Private to GM:<br />
It&#039;s a runner bean.  In the morning they will have freshly grown<br />
mounts and pack beans to spur them on their journey :)</font></p>
<p>Oh and the Secured perimiter consists of various devices devised for<br />
the purpose, and one that was initually designed to wall paper houses,<br />
but turned out a spot too deadly. ]</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The morning dawned clear but mercifully frost-free, and the final<br />
sprouty watch rose the other vegetables from their patches.  True<br />
to Gustafssen&#039;s design, their beans had sprouted into a veritable<br />
platoon of mounts for the veg and their equipment.</p>
<p>Before long, they were on their way and speeding toward the border.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>When at last they reached it, the sun was high in the sky.<br />
Whatever kingdom they had been in, none of them quite knew, but as they<br />
crossed some unmarked line things <i>changed</i>.<br />
The sun seemed weaker here; smaller and paler.  Though the air and<br />
the forest did not seem immediately different, barely five minutes<br />
beany gallop later they were starting to alter too.  The wind<br />
developed a chill, and the once lush deciduous trees were thinning and<br />
being superseded by hardier conifers.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>As they rode deeper in to the strange country the lead potatoes took<br />
meticulous notes and the aubergine even offered up some help to the<br />
analysis, once the sprouts had held it upside down and shaken it a<br />
little. Periodically copies of their notes were attached to small<br />
fluffs of dandelion seeds and let off into the breeze to carry their<br />
cargo back to their creator.</p>
<p>As the country became increasingly of the V-Team seemed to<br />
unconsciously ride closer together, and several of the Sprouts drew<br />
their weapons and rode with them resting on their saddles.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>By the time the vegetables were in sight of the first of the towers,<br />
several of the higher water content members of the group were starting<br />
to suffer severely from the cold.  Yet still they pressed on,<br />
nearing what they understood to be the lesser of their two targets, the<br />
other still being some way in the distance.</p>
<p>The tower leapt up out of the surrounding snow like some god had<br />
gripped the fabric of the land and pulled it upward.  The spire of<br />
marble and ice would tower over any faerie, and its height to the<br />
vegetables was even more impressive.  Close up even the doors<br />
loomed large, each one a single slab of ice twenty feet tall.<br />
They were closed, and there was no knocker.</p>
<p>The place was silent, devoid of life.  The only sounds were the<br />
whistling of the wind and the scratching of pencils on paper as the<br />
tubers made meticulous notes.  Nothing seemed to object to the<br />
vegetables&#039; presence this close to the tower of the missing Queen, for<br />
there was no other life there even to notice them.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>As the cold deepened the Starchy adventurers broke open a tightly<br />
wrapped bundle from behind the saddles of their riding beans, and<br />
handed out the Goosberry skin cloaks to their compatriots; who eagerly<br />
snuggled into the warm hairy garments.  With the parties comforts<br />
seen to they set about investigating the great doors in front of them<br />
attempting to assertain whether or not they could gain access to the<br />
great tower.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The doors were shut tight, welded together by new snowfall.  A<br />
brief scout of the area revealed them to be the only entrance and in<br />
fact the only opening within twenty feet of the ground.  Above<br />
that height, however, a set of slits in the icy stonework ran all the<br />
way around the perimeter.  They were clearly designed for arrows<br />
to be fired out of, but with a little support and some fibrous energy,<br />
it looked almost as if several sprouts could be propelled in...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Gustafssen</b></p>
<p>Quickly and quietly the V-Team once more went into action like a well<br />
oiled machine.  Without uttering a single word they split<br />
themselves up into work parties&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Two of the sprouts and the Aubergine &#8216;Wizzard&#8217; headed off around the<br />
side of the tower and started to dig into the huge snowdrift at the<br />
side of the castle and start to build themselves a seat of operations.<br />
Making the initial incision into the snow by simple method of throwing<br />
the Aubergine head first into the snow&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;  The remaining Vegetables turned their minds towards gaining<br />
entry to the tower.  The potatoes once more reach into their packs<br />
and begin to screw together a pintle mounted crossbow.  Meanwhile<br />
the two sprouts, with the aid of the cauliflower, started suiting up in<br />
rock grey ninja clothes and climbing harnesses.  Then taking<br />
careful aim the potatoes loose a bolt towards an arrow slit.  The<br />
bolt flies straight and true arching through throw the slit trailing a<br />
light celery fibre rope.  With precisions timing the grapnel head<br />
clicked open and wedged itself into the stonework of the slit anchoring<br />
the rope.  Approaching the rope the Ninja sprouts tugged on the<br />
rope and hung off it for a moment to test the strength of the<br />
anchor.  Satisfied with the anchorage they sprouts quickly clipped<br />
on their climbing ratchets and quickly scaled the rope up to the arrow<br />
slit.  Once they reached the slit they quickly pulled up the<br />
sturdier rope attached to the first one and quickly secured it.</p>
<p>Down below the two potatoes quickly packed four backpacks with various<br />
bits and pieces of equipment that the two sprouts, cauliflower and<br />
potato might need on their sojourn into the tower; then after clipping<br />
on their miniature blue toothed cucumbers and a quick comms check and a<br />
change into grey ninja clothes all was ready.  First the Potato<br />
wall walked his way up the tower, closely followed by the cauliflower<br />
who had paused only to root out a few choice articles from his sardine<br />
tin of delights.  Once the whole team was up the packs were tied<br />
to the rope and hauled up.  Then after distributing the packs<br />
between themselves and the rope was curled up on the floor of the<br />
slit.  Then they turned and prepared to enter the tower&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Down below the remaining potato started the clean up operation.<br />
Quickly he gathered up the remaining equipment placed into the packs on<br />
the riding beans and lead them round to where the sprouts and aubergine<br />
were digging away.  In the short period of time they had been at<br />
it they had already dug out an outer cavern with enough space to fit<br />
the beans and the gear into and they were now studiously working on<br />
expanding the complex.  Given enough time the complex would<br />
encircle the tower with a network of defence tunnels and<br />
instillations.  After depositing the beans in the initial cavern<br />
the potato headed back and started the painstaking process of erasing<br />
the signs of their presence in the area around the tower.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Inside the castle, the vegetables encountered a scene of sterile<br />
desolation.  The room was clearly long abandoned, with each<br />
surface covered in a thick layer of dust and cobwebs draping every<br />
corner.  But it wasn&#039;t untidy; not left in a rush.<br />
Everything was neatly put away, the bedsheets folded and drawers closed.</p>
<p>The door to the room they had arrived in was closed, but<br />
unlocked.  Outside it, a long corridor branched off to many rooms<br />
much like the first.  The corridor curved off in the distance,<br />
seeming to encircle the tower.  There were steps up and steps<br />
down, all appearing to be in a perfect state of repair bar their thick<br />
layer of dust.</p>
