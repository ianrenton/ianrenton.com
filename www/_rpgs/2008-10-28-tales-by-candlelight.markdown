<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Evening wore on, and before too long the bell was rung for the evening<br />
meal.  A remarkable number of the guests had stayed at the castle<br />
despite the festivities having officially finished, but as was the<br />
tradition for such large parties, guests would be entertained for<br />
several days if they had no pressing engagements elsewhere.</p>
<p>Dinner was conducted as a remarkably less formal affair than it had<br />
been the previous night.  The top table - mercifully repaired,<br />
along with the rest of the room that had been damaged during the<br />
breakfast food-fight - sat empty, and its normal occupants ate with the<br />
rest of the guests.</p>
<p>Whilst Regara sat with several other traditionally-built dukes and<br />
duchesses somewhat near the waiters&#039; entrance, Abel found himself a<br />
seat next to the newly-returned Eshu.</p>
<p>"So," he said, after a smile and a suitable pause, "it&#039;s certainly been a while!  Where have you been all this time?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"In Mortalia," the traveller replied, waving her hand as though it were<br />
nothing of consequence.  "Stories here were getting a little<br />
stale, although if I&#039;d stuck around for a bit it would have become a<br />
little more storyteller friendly."</p>
<p>Still, there were more stories from the one hundred Mortalia years than<br />
in the three years that had passed in Arcadia.  When the Titanic<br />
had sunk, Saledenre had been standing on the docks of New York as the<br />
survivors came in; when the trenches of the First World War were dug<br />
and shells fell from the sky, Saledenre had stood in the mirk and the<br />
squalor as explosions lit the sky.  The Blitz, Beatles Mania, the<br />
fall of the Berlin Wall, the final of the first Pop Idol; Saledenre had<br />
been there, taking notes as she watched all these pass her by.</p>
<p>"Are you still hiding away with your books, Prince Abel?" she<br />
teased.  She had never quite undertood Abel&#039;s studiousness - it<br />
all seemed so much effort to read compared to a good, exciting story.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ve not seen a lot of them of late," said Abel.<br />
"Most of them got left behind in the rush.  Once we lost the<br />
borders, well...  We didn&#039;t have a lot of time to pack."<br />
Abel sighed, and sipped at his wine glass.</p>
<p>"I suppose we&#039;ve been rather acquainted with your way of life<br />
lately.  I dare say it takes a while to get used to it; I&#039;m sure<br />
as hell glad to be home again!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Sometimes a life on the roads can be dreary," Saledenre agreed, her<br />
expression momentarily serious and weary before a glint appeared in her<br />
eye once more.  "That is, of course, until the next good story<br />
comes along.  Has House Poppy fared overly ill during the time of<br />
my absence?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"You could say that," said Abel.  "For a start, you&#039;ve probably<br />
noticed the lack of my father.  Besides him most of the nobles<br />
escaped, along with a few staff and reserve soldiers.  I suppose<br />
you haven&#039;t noticed, but we don&#039;t have very much of an army left now.</p>
<p>"Still, the castle seems mostly to have survived intact.  And, for<br />
all the challenge and the danger it posed, I think that two years away<br />
from home taught us a lot.  Certainly some... interesting times."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"We do indeed.  And the House will rebuild, I am certain.<br />
Are there any more of our people travelling beyond Arcadia?  If I<br />
could be of service to both you and Her Grace, your mother, in bringing<br />
them back to swell the House once more then I am at your command."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Not that I-"</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose there is.  The Huntsman&#039;s wife, now, what was her<br />
name...  Serin, I think.  She disappeared not long after we<br />
left Poppy two years ago.  He doesn&#039;t seem to have taken it that<br />
badly, considering, though I suppose that&#039;s just their way.  It<br />
would certainly be good to have her back again.  Are you keen to<br />
return to the Human world again so soon?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Not so keen, no," Saledenre admitted, "but I&#039;m probably the best<br />
you&#039;ve got to send on such a mission.  Mortalia is strange... we<br />
Arcadians tend to uhm... now what is it they say?"  She frowned,<br />
waiting for the required phrase to come to her.  "As yes &#039;stick<br />
out like a sore thumb&#039;.    Are you certain she has drifted<br />
into the otherworld?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Yes, she... tends to drift back and forth.  Truth be told, her<br />
particular specialities could be quite useful to the war effort -<br />
though I&#039;m not sure whether she&#039;d appreciate being brought back for<br />
that purpose.  Or maybe she would; she&#039;s an odd character for<br />
sure."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Odd?" Saledenre enquired, still wracking her brain for a recollection<br />
of the Huntsman&#039;s wife and why she, of all those Poppies who were<br />
missing, might be so important.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, she&#039;d be odd by our standards and by the humans&#039;.  Wherever<br />
she sits in the middle - maybe she&#039;s normal for that, but who can<br />
tell?  Regardless of that, she&#039;s just the sort that seems to<br />
accept whatever life throws at her.  The first time she came here,<br />
she seemed to settle in just as easily as she might in her own world."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"How incredibly odd," Saledenre replied.  "I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve come<br />
across a fence-sitter before.  I&#039;m sure she&#039;ll have an interesting<br />
take on things."  Already Saledenre&#039;s mind was calculating exactly<br />
what type of tale she could spin once she finally caught up with the<br />
Huntsman&#039;s wife.  People who did not entirely fit in with the<br />
world around them often saw things in a different way; that had<br />
certainly been true for Saledenre during her time in Mortalia.</p>
<p>The Eshu grinned, seeing an opportunity being dangled in front of her<br />
like some appetizing treat.  "So, when did you want me to start<br />
off?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, er...  Whenever you like, I suppose," said Abel.  "I<br />
would imagine you&#039;re somewhat tired, so please at least stay for the<br />
night.  In the morning...  Actually, I could accompany you<br />
some of the way if you&#039;d like.  Barring yesterday afternoon&#039;s<br />
bizarre adventure, I&#039;ve not been able to see the human world in quite<br />
some time, so I&#039;d like to see what kind of libraries they have these<br />
days."  Abel thought for a while.  "They do still have<br />
libraries, don&#039;t they?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"You shall have to tell me more about that later," the Eshu told Abel,<br />
eager to hear anything about the &#039;bizarre&#039; but for now her mind turned<br />
towards the mortal world.</p>
<p>"Of course, Mortalia still has libraries but now they have something<br />
better!"  Saledenre exclaimed gleefully, clapping her hands<br />
together with such speed that the ends of her fingers seemed to<br />
blur.  "They have something called... called... called the In Ter<br />
Net."  Saledenre had only once tried to navigate the world wide<br />
web one late evening in an Internet Cafe when she had nothing better to<br />
do, but it had not sat well with her.  Stories were there,<br />
instantaneous and expressionless, right before her.  No time had<br />
been taken in their telling, no suspense built.  The whole<br />
experience had left the storyteller feeling cold and disappointed.</p>
<p>"There are so many things on it, more than a hundred libraries&#039; worth<br />
of information," she continued, now parroting all that she had heard of<br />
the information highway.  She was certain that Abel would find joy<br />
in it whereas she would not.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Wow," said Abel.  "I should definitely like to see that!<br />
Whereabouts in the world do they keep it?  The building itself<br />
must be a sight to behold!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Oh, but they are not kept in a building," Saledenre replied with a<br />
laugh, "the information is held by Sir Ver and you can petition him for<br />
the information through the marvelous machines called computers.<br />
It&#039;s so quick and often Sir Ver does not restrict the information you<br />
are asking for, although national secrets are rightly held close to the<br />
knight&#039;s heart.  Many people can even ask questions like these<br />
from their own homes!  I bet Gustafssen has not thought of<br />
anything quite so amazing!"</p>
<p>Having lived among the humans for three of their generations, Saledenre<br />
could not help but feel a little proud at their achievements.<br />
They had never failed to fascinate her, especially their ability to<br />
cram so much productivity into their short little existences.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Machines that petition someone for information?" asked Abel.  "I<br />
think Gustafssen did once produce something called a &#039;Public Service<br />
Onion&#039;, but this human thing sounds much more intriguing.  If the<br />
people have such machines in their homes, this Ver must be in an awful<br />
rush to produce everyone&#039;s information..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Well, I think Sir Ver is the one in charge but he has serfs and<br />
labourers to do the actual searching.  I mean, people can petition<br />
the Dutchess but it is her underlings who do the actual work, am I not<br />
correct?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well yes, generally so.  This... machinery that the humans<br />
use.  If I were to use it instead of a library, do you think it<br />
would be easy for me to use, or should I request an audience with Sir<br />
Ver himself?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Hmmm," Saledenre considered the question for a moment.  "I have<br />
never seen any posters or announcements made by Sir Ver before so I get<br />
the feeling he is possibly hidden away as a custodian of all this<br />
information.  Perhaps we can access the computers first and then,<br />
if we have further questions, seek an audience with Sir Ver."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"That sounds sensible.  It does seem somewhat of a selfish<br />
request, but would you mind if I accompanied you briefly to the human<br />
world - just for a while, so that I can see how these &#039;computers&#039; work?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Certainly, I shall be glad for the company," the Eshu said brightly,<br />
suddenly excited at the prospect of the trip with the knowledgeable<br />
prince into the strangeness of Mortalia.  "Perhaps you can get<br />
Gustafssen to create a computer on your return and the you can<br />
communicate with Sir Ver from the comfort of Poppy Castle."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, that would certainly be... interesting," said Abel, taking a sip<br />
from his glass.  "Gustafssen building a machine that talks to the<br />
human world, what could possibly go wrong?"</p>
<p>He chuckled.</p>
<p>"When were you wanting to leave?  First thing in the morning, or will you be staying here longer?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>"Hmmm, maybe mid-morning.  I need the right kind of light to find<br />
the thinness where we can pass through.  Dawn is abso-bally-lutely<br />
awful for that kind of thing."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Right then.  I shall have my things packed tonight, and shall we<br />
depart after breakfast tomorrow?  That shouldn&#039;t be too early -<br />
after all the time on the road, I&#039;m quite glad to be back to the<br />
House&#039;s more... relaxed mealtimes."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Saledenre</b></p>
<p>Saledenre seemed a little subdued at the reminder that she had missed<br />
many of House Poppy&#039;s hardships during her time in Mortalia.  It<br />
seemed as though the grimness of the otherworld had seeped into her own<br />
one, turning light and laughter into sadness and death.  She<br />
wondered if perhaps the disbelief and science of Mortalia had somehow<br />
allowed for such a transformation.  Perhaps she would discuss her<br />
fears with Abel, but it might be best to wait until they were on the<br />
road and away from too many listening ears before voicing her concerns.</p>
