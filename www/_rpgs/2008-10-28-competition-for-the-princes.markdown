<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>A carnival air suffuses the castle and its inhabitants today, as if the<br />
building itself were as pleased to have its owners back as its owners<br />
are to return to it.  Everyone is jovial, and the corridors are<br />
full of nobles and servants alike laughing and joking.</p>
<p>Everyone&#039;s in a good mood - except for the Duchess, who as usual is rolling d20 for her mood every few minutes<font color="red">*</font>,<br />
and her two sons, whom no-one as seen hide nor hair of since they<br />
arrived.  And, unfortunately, finding them has just become your<br />
job.</p>
<p>There are few words that ever pass the Duchess&#039; lips that people fear<br />
more than a sentence starting with "Could you do me a favour,<br />
and..."  For some reason, people never seem to refuse her.<br />
At least, you&#039;ve never *met* anyone who&#039;s refused...</p>
<p>Still, that seems to be your job for the moment.  Find the<br />
princes.  Pah, what a task!  A task befitting a servant,<br />
that&#039;s what, not a noble!</p>
<p>Last time you spoke to him, Abel was holding a cup of cocoa and wearing<br />
a dressing gown.  He&#039;s probably enjoying not sleeping rough for<br />
the first time in several weeks.  As for Cain - who knows.</p>
<p><font color="red">* OOC: Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m not *actually* rolling d20 for her mood swings.  Although I&#039;m tempted sometimes =p</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Azimov</b></p>
<p>Azimov sighed at his reflection in the small mirror. He adjusted the<br />
white frills of his uniform and checked his sword was secure at his<br />
belt. He knew it made the others nervous to see a fey carrying a piece<br />
of human steel, but what better a weapon? Finally content that his<br />
reflection suited his mood he took a light step left from the roof<br />
beams in the main hall and dropped gracefully to the floor. After<br />
several hundred years of living high falling was more an inconvenience<br />
than a problem.</p>
<p>Stepping outside, nodding to the somewhat astonished guards at the door<br />
Azimov took a deep breath and moved into the woods a short way until he<br />
found the stand of hazel. It was just as he&#039;d remembered. With a flick<br />
of the wrist the sword removed a branch and was sheathed in a fluid<br />
motion. Grasping the waist high, still green stick and resting it over<br />
his shoulders Azimov moved towards the nobles quarters. Cain and Abel<br />
would be somewhere and the best place to look would be where their<br />
things were.</p>
<p>Azimov reached the doors to the high noble&#039;s halls and sauntered<br />
through confident in locating a likely person to ask of the young<br />
princes whereabouts.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Azimov</b></p>
<p>Looking around the inside of the entryway and seeing no-one a slight<br />
frown crossed Azimov&#039;s face. Now where in the world would the guards<br />
be? or the servants? Well it wouldn&#039;t be unreasonable to assume the<br />
servants would be in the kitchens or bedrooms attempting to repair the<br />
damage done by enemy looters. It was then that he caught a glimpse of<br />
movement.</p>
<p>Dropping into a combat stance, holding the willow as a sword Azimov<br />
scanned the far side of the entrance hall and spotted... A potato. With<br />
four legs. Dragging a piece of rope.</p>
<p>Something was very wrong here. Azimov waited for the potato to<br />
disappear round the corner and as softly and quietly as possible<br />
followed, clinging to the shadows.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As Azimov trails the rope-trailing potato, it gradually dawns on him<br />
that the castle is not as quiet as he would have expected.  In<br />
fact, it sounds awfully like a rowdy mob is rampaging around.  A<br />
rowdy mob that sounds quite a lot like it&#039;s... behind him.</p>
<p>Hearing the increased volume, the potato quickly darts off down the corridor, still dragging its rope.</p>
<p>Azimov turns to see a few sprightly-looking servants appear from around a corner a few yards back down the corridor.</p>
<p>"&#039;Scuse me, mi&#039;lord," one of them asks as he runs up to Azimov, "has ya&#039; seen a &#039;tater &#039;round &#039;ere?"</p>
<p>A fraction of a second before he has the chance to reply, the rest of<br />
what does in fact turn out to be a rowdy mob appears around the corner<br />
too.  It numbers three dozen or more, and barrels past Azimov down<br />
the corridor led by a man in red-and-white livery blowing a horn and<br />
shouting "Return this instant, damn starchy tuber!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Azimov</b></p>
<p>Flattening himself further into the wall to avoid being trampled by the<br />
unruly mob of servants and guards Azimov noticed a general theme in the<br />
mob&#039;s weaponry. They all seemed to be wielding forks...</p>
<p>After the mob had passed Azimov stepped back into the corridor and<br />
confronted the servant who looked somewhat dazed and was brushing<br />
himself off, having just been run over by said fork wielding mob.</p>
<p>"Would you happen to know where the princes are? I must speak with them on behalf of the duchess."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Oi, oi, oi... Oi &#039;ave no oidea, milord," the servant replied.<br />
"Oi was just &#039;own &#039;elpin&#039; out wiv t&#039;kitchens, an&#039; all&#039;f suddin &#039;all was<br />
chasin&#039; out &#039;door!"</p>
<p>"Still," he continued, "them say tha&#039; tha&#039; &#039;landra lady&#039;s bin wiv<br />
t&#039;princes all since we got back, sah nowt ken wha&#039; theh may be up tah."</p>
<p>With that, the man made an excuse involving the Duchess&#039; starch-free<br />
wrath and darted off down the corridor, leaving only the faint<br />
confusion of his unpredicatble accent in his wake.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Azimov</b></p>
<p>Azimov imperceptibly shrugged as he watched the servant hurry off<br />
waving the fork above his head, vainly attempting to catch up with the<br />
mob. There was clearly only one thing for it, he&#039;d have to check the<br />
princes room and hope he was in. Azimov headed up the stairs, noting<br />
the occasional darting shadow that marked the passing of an un-evicted<br />
rat, or, possibly a potato?</p>
<p>Reaching Abels door first Azimov knocked lightly and politely awaited a response, he could hear some kind of scuffling within.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Come in!" comes the somewhat strained reply.  "Ah!  Why,<br />
you...  Um, I mean, I&#039;m sorry!  Please come in.  Just<br />
don&#039;t let the damn thing escape when you do!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Azimov</b></p>
<p>Azimov sighed and placed one hand gently to his temple. This would not<br />
end well... he just knew it. He readies his "sword" and pressed the<br />
door open stepping in but a moment later with a resounding crack of the<br />
willow cane at about boot height, just ready to catch the fleeing<br />
potato.</p>
<p>Except it wasn&#039;t there. Having safely inserted himself into the room,<br />
secure in the knowledge the potato was still inside azimov was greeted<br />
with the most bizzare  sight...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel&#039;s room normally being the tidiest place in all the castle, Azimov<br />
is surprised to find it in uproar.  All manner of things are<br />
scattered across the floor, the shelves, the bed... and in some cases<br />
even the walls and the ceiling.</p>
<p>After a moment or two for it all to sink in, the most truly ridiculous<br />
fact about the scene strikes.  Both Abel and a limbed potato seem<br />
to have paused to examine the newcomer from the positions they happened<br />
to have found themselves in - the potato skittering across a<br />
now-inkstained writing desk, and Abel himself hanging upside-down from<br />
the chandelier brandishing in the potato&#039;s direction an extremely heavy<br />
copy of Sproutling and Turtleneck&#039;s Garden Almanack.</p>
<p>"Oh, hello," Abel says during the somewhat surreal pause.</p>
<p>The potato squeaks what appears to be a greeting to Azimov, then a<br />
clear taunt at Abel - and the madcap chase begins anew with Abel<br />
launching himself uncharacteristically swiftly at the desk just as the<br />
potato jumps for the floor...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Azimov</b></p>
<p>still somewhat confused at the palace invasion of potatoes Azimov<br />
remains still by the door observing the madcap chase as both prince and<br />
potator shoot over beds, round desks and, at least once, up the wall.<br />
After about a minute of observing the potatoes evasive action Azimov<br />
too three brisk steps forward bringing the willow down right in front<br />
of the potato.</p>
<p>The four limbes tuber speaked in panic and leapt, characteristically to<br />
the left... right into Azimovs waiting hand. The potato almost<br />
immediately wriggled free and leapt away... right onto prince abels<br />
chest. The young prince savagely grabbed the potato with a cry of<br />
triumph. Azimov grinned in triumph and shouldered the willow.</p>
<p>"Well caught my friend! However did such a small vegetable cause so much havoc?" Azimov asked enquiringly of Abel.</p>
<p>"Please excuse my somewhat less than regal behaivior old friend but<br />
this little thing is incredibly fast. What was it you wanted?" Abel<br />
asked.</p>
<p>"The evening meal will be occuring at seven my lord and your mother has<br />
requested your presence. In full court regalia i&#039;m afraid, even those<br />
tight&#039;s you hate." Azimov smiled apologetically at the stricken look on<br />
the young princes face. "I believe there are to be several dances and<br />
numerous games. Would you happen to know you brothers location my lord?<br />
I need to track him down and make sure he is ready for the meal, and<br />
dressed appropriately."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>meanwhile... ilandra looked out the door to see what the commotion was<br />
about and spotted several potatoes running around and causing havoc.<br />
she smiled to herself and said, to no-one in particular "a pooka<br />
couldn&#039;t have planned it better" concentrating hard for a second she<br />
transformed into a cat, this time taking her clothes with her.</p>
<p>"better go investigate and make sure cain is ok" she ran into cain&#039;s<br />
room only to find him gone, so turning back she decided to check if he<br />
was with his brother.</p>
<p>As she left the room, she tripped a noble up "oh sorry!" she exclaimed. "no chance you&#039;d help me find cain, is there?"</p>
<p>[<font>Private to Azimov:<br />
i don&#039;t know what your character looks like so i couldn&#039;t really<br />
describe him... sorry for butting into your prologue</font>]</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Azimov</b></p>
<p>Azimov looked round from his prone position, flat on the floor to<br />
see... A cat. A tabby cat. after a quick rifle of his memory (still<br />
somewhat fuzzy after sleeping for three years) a name surfaced and with<br />
it some memories.</p>
<p>"Illandra! It&#039;s me Azimov. It&#039;s great to see you again! I&#039;ve been<br />
looking for Cain myself and according to his brother he&#039;s off hiding in<br />
the library again. probbably in a fort made from the sofa&#039;s again"</p>
<p>Azimov very evidently rolled his eyes and grinned.</p>
<p>"Wanna help me go find him?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>From somewhere in the castle, a horribly slow grating sound of stone rubbing against stone echoes...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Azimov</b></p>
<p>Azimov&#039;s brows knit in thought briefly.</p>
<p>"That sounds awfully like... something that shouldn&#039;t be opened! That&#039;s<br />
one of the secret doors going. Damn! C&#039;mon Illandra, the prince can<br />
wait. I need to find out who&#039;s messing with my defences!"</p>
<p>With that Azimov tears off down the corridor towards the source of the<br />
noise, his mind racing trying to remember which one of the secret<br />
entrances was in need of oiling so badly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Azimov</b></p>
<p>Azimov and Illandra skittered out into the courtyard and stopped in<br />
shock looking at the potato sat in front of the complex controls of the<br />
giant... Thing. Rising from the tower. Azimov stepped back into the<br />
shadows to observe the carnage gently pulling Illandra behind cover.</p>
<p>"I have... no idea what that is. But it&#039;s one of Gustaffsens idea&#039;s for<br />
certain... And i&#039;m sure he should be the one dealing with it. Damnit.<br />
where is he?"</p>
<p>It was at this point Azimov began to finally grasp the severity of the<br />
situation. The tallest tower in the castle has, apparently, been taken<br />
by hostile (or at least hugely mischevous) forces and they hold control<br />
of one of Gustaffsens devices. This does not bode well for the future.<br />
Azimov began scanning the tower for possible ways in and racking his<br />
mind, trying to remember which secret passages in the castle led into<br />
the tower.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Azimov</b></p>
<p>Azimov stared in blank amazement for a moment as the extremely (un)<br />
athletic Gustaffsen sails overhead and lands neatly in a lower window<br />
of the tower. Azimov, realising that he may be in need of some<br />
assistance formulated a hasty plan.</p>
<p>After raiding the castle toolshed to get the longest tree rake possible<br />
(well over eight feet) azimov ran to the base of the tower, dodging<br />
some of the temporary missiles, leaned the pole against the tower wall<br />
and shinned up (ooc: probbably on about the third attempt knowing my<br />
luck ^_^. Athletics + Strength).</p>
<p>And hared after the now sprinting Gustaffsen with a grand cry back to Illandra of "Don&#039;t get into too much mischief!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>ilandra looked as hurt as it is possible for a tabby to look... "as if! ....bored now" and slunk off to look for cain</p>
<p><i> I wonder if taters are yummy... </i></p>
<p>after much slinking,(and to be honest, the fact she could faintly hear<br />
cain&#039;s worried voice and had followed it) ilandra finally manages to<br />
crash into cain&#039;s leg... <i> ok, moment of truth </i> "I wanna be your cat in shining armour and save you from the food"</p>
<p>ilandra could feel herself changing back again as she did whenever she was nervous.<br />
"azzy said the taters could kill you and stuff... so I figured I better<br />
tell you before I get killed by a tater... I found you a shiny" she<br />
produced a shiny buckle from her pocket and handed it to him. "now lets<br />
run away together and help azimov" she grabbed cain&#039;s hand and pulled<br />
him after her</p>
<p>[ooc] sorry, just got  the web back [/ooc]</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Wha..?  Oh no, not again..." Cain sighed as the now human and<br />
thoroughly naked Ilandra dragged him from his room and through the<br />
winding corridors of the castle.</p>
<p>"Cat in shining armour?" he mused, but didn&#039;t find the courage to actually say.  "Oh dear..."</p>
<p>"Um, Ilandra," he half-whispered as soon as he got the chance.<br />
"Where are we going?  And, erm, shouldn&#039;t you... put some clothes<br />
on?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>From somewhere outside a loud throbbing sound starts to make itself<br />
heard, first through the feet, then through the ears, then seemingly<br />
directly into the brain.</p>
<p>As the pitch and frequency of the noise rises, the air begins to take<br />
on a strange consistency - still air-like, but consisting of tiny<br />
independent vibrations that feel odd against the skin.  Kind of<br />
like standing in gaseous facial scrub soap, in fact.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>ilandra blushed "erm... yeah... can I steal your cape please?" without<br />
waiting for a reply she put her arms around him and unpinned the cape<br />
then wrapped it round her. in doing so she caught a glimpse of the<br />
tower outside, where azimov was doing a pretty good job of being ok<br />
halfway up it... <i> I don&#039;t think he really needs my help... and I might be able to use this opportunity to my advantage with cain... </i><br />
having covered herself up she turned to cain, who&#039;d gone as red as she<br />
was... "sorry about that, I tend to be more careful than that but you<br />
make me nervous...." she looked at his expression "...not in a bad<br />
way... just, you erm.. you distract me. anyway let&#039;s go find a dress,<br />
you can help me choose and that way I can keep you safe like I promised<br />
azzy"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Right.  Yes, er...  Anyway," Cain stuttered.  "You<br />
still have dresses here?  That weren&#039;t, you know, plundered by the<br />
enemy or anything?  Wow.  I guess I&#039;ve been travelling for so<br />
long that I&#039;d forgotten what having more than one set of clothes is<br />
like..."</p>
<p>"Well, if we&#039;re off to choose you a dress, lead on!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>after much turning corners they get to ilandra&#039;s room where she opens<br />
her wardrobe to reveal a bevy of dresses of all different colours...<br />
"right... pick one"<br />
she picks out the one cain was pointing at and nods her approval "but<br />
you have to shut your eyes while I dress... it&#039;s not proper to stare at<br />
naked ladies" <i> not that he hasn&#039;t seen me naked or anything...</i><br />
dressing over, it suddenly dawns on ilandra that in all the cafuffle of<br />
the taters no-one&#039;s checked on regara. "caaaaaain..." she say, sugar<br />
dripping from every letter "do  you reckon your mum needs a cat in<br />
shining armour too?" <i> please let him say no, please let him say no </i><br />
"cos maybe we ought to check on her... she seemed a bit off with me... I think she might be ill..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Cat in shining armour?  I can think of plenty of things she&#039;d<br />
need more."  Cain paused for a moment.  "In fact, I&#039;m having<br />
trouble thinking of anything she&#039;d need less."</p>
<p>"So, er," he continued, "now you&#039;re dressed again, what was it you said<br />
we were supposed to be doing?  Helping Azimov?  What on earth<br />
would he need help with?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m not sure Azimov really needs our help... he seemed perfectly fine<br />
to climb the tower... but he said how we have to keep the princes<br />
healthy and happy. We could always go find Abel... or ice cream...<br />
hmm... ice cream..." she checks her &#039;watch&#039; "can you take me to the<br />
hummums? cos it&#039;s safe time." she looks thoughtful for a second while<br />
cain panics. "abel can take me!!!! lets go find abel!!!"<br />
cain inwardly groans, wishing life with ilandra was less hassle.<br />
she grabs his hands and takes him to the fireplace, chucking in a key<br />
as they approach, cain starts to panic before he realises they&#039;ve just<br />
walked into able&#039;s room and ilandra is now picking up the key. "you<br />
have to have some secret passages in the house you know..." she offers<br />
him as part of an explanation. abel looks up from his book and notes<br />
the presence of the intruders. "ah the happy couple, how may i help you<br />
ilandra?"<br />
ilandra bounces "hummums!!! we gotsta see the hummums cos it&#039;s safe<br />
time!!! and you always take me so they don&#039;t pound me! i even have the<br />
leash" she holds up the collar and leash they&#039;d stolen off the<br />
rottweiler the last time they were with the &#039;hummums&#039;. cain goes bright<br />
red and looks about ready to pass out.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Riiight," Abel says, his gaze sliding back and forth between the two of them.  "Just hang on a minute."</p>
<p>Abel sits in silence for what turns out to be more like five minutes before finally bookmarking and closing his book.</p>
<p>"Just finishing the chapter.  Incidentally, how long have you been able to teleport into my room like that?"</p>
<p>"Ooh, about... forever?  How else do you think someone cleaned it?"</p>
<p>"One would assume we employed the maids for a reason.  And to use the doors.  But never mind."</p>
<p>So saying, Abel wandered across to the other side of the room and<br />
produced three reddish-coloured stones.  Two of them were chucked<br />
in the direction of Cain and Ilandra.</p>
<p>"You know the drill by now," Abel muttered.  "Just don&#039;t lose them, right?"</p>
<p>Ilandra suddenly develops a pocket to put her stone in, whilst Cain&#039;s is lost somewhere amongst his coat&#039;s myriad of pockets.</p>
<p>As Cain and Ilandra make their way - somewhat troublesomely in his case<br />
- over the piles of books that litter the floor, Abel drags two large<br />
maps out of one of his many cupboards and unfolds them on the desk one<br />
atop the other.</p>
<p>The topmost map barely seems a map at all, rather it is a whorling mass<br />
of colour that stretches and pulsates and somehow manages to maintain<br />
two-dimensionality.  Abel retrieves the pencil from behind his ear<br />
and marks a circle on this top map.  As he does so, the area<br />
inside the circle ceases its fluctuation and becomes a pretty picture<br />
of Castle Poppy.  Abel then brushes this map aside and looks over<br />
the second one.</p>
<p>"Where are we going, again?" he asks.</p>
<p>"To the place with the ice cream!!" Ilandra shouts.  "We have to<br />
steal Ben&#039;s ice cream, and Jerry&#039;s!!  And feed it to Cain!"</p>
<p>Cain sighs.</p>
<p>"Right," Abel says, drawing a similar pencil circle on this remarkably more normal map.</p>
<p>He walks over to join Ilandra and his brother in the slightly cleared space in the centre of the room.</p>
<p>"Ready?"</p>
<p>"Sure, why not," Ilandra says, grabbing Cain&#039;s hand a little bit tighter.</p>
<p>"Then hang on tight!"</p>
<p>As he says this, Abel&#039;s eyes glow a bright white, and the stones in the<br />
posession of each of the three begin to glow in sympathy.  A<br />
rising whirring sound echoes through the room, and a sourceless wind<br />
blows paper and books from their original places into... only slightly<br />
less organised positions.</p>
<p>Over the course of maybe a dozen seconds, the world itself around the<br />
three glows a brighter and brighter white, until everything is obscured<br />
as if by some celestial mist, and then -</p>
<p>Whump.</p>
<p><font color="red">OOC: 8 successes.  Holy fuck.</font></p>
<p>Cain, Abel and Ilandra (who has just turned into a cat purely on<br />
reflex) are surrounded all of a sudden by blackness.  A few<br />
tendrils of the white mist sink into the ground, leaving their eyes to<br />
adjust to the blackness.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>a voice from ankle height suddenly declares "i know how these things<br />
work, hold on a sec gotta find the glamour switch!!!" a few minutes<br />
later the two guys find themselves in a brightly lit ben and jerry&#039;s<br />
factory warehouse surrounded by multiple flavours of ben and jerry&#039;s.<br />
they realize they are shivering, probably because it&#039;s -5 degrees in<br />
there...</p>
<p>ilandra fishes in her invisible bag for spoons and pulls three out,<br />
handing them to the others. she reaches up and drags a tub or two of<br />
ice cream down. as they sit eating the ice cream (cookie dough and<br />
chunky monkeys flavours by the way) they discuss what they&#039;ll do next.<br />
they finally decide upon leaving the really cold room.</p>
<p>"i have a plan!!!" exclaims ilandra, looking conspiratorially at abel.<br />
she mumbles a nonsense poem (roses are red, probably) then grabs cain<br />
and kisses him. "right, cain, you are able to walk through that wall...<br />
once you get outside, you can poke your head in and tell us what&#039;s<br />
outside. gogogogogo!!!"<br />
<font color="red"> 2 successes </font></p>
<p>cain gets up, clearly fuddled, and walks into the wall with a thud.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Whu?"  Cain mutters after his head whacks hard against the concrete wall.  "Why is there a wall here?  I..."</p>
<p>He stands still and silent for a moment, as if deep in thought.<br />
Then, slowly as looks of realisation tend to dawn on peoples&#039; faces,<br />
Cain turns bright red head-to-toe.</p>
<p>"Ilandra...?"</p>
<p>Abel glares in Ilandra&#039;s direction, his arms crossed in front of him.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>a crimson ilandra bursts into tears. "it woulda worked in house poppy<br />
and now your gonna tell regara and she&#039;s gonna kill me or something and<br />
it was my first kiss and it&#039;s not fair!!!!!" she turns into a kitten<br />
and runs up cain&#039;s trousers into one of his pockets. for about 15<br />
seconds they can hear the mild sobs of a cat. occasionally interjected<br />
with laments. that is, until ilandra realises they&#039;re not gonna get out<br />
of there any faster if she hides. she comes out and goes up to the<br />
door, turns back into her full sized self and, concentrating, jumps<br />
once, touches the ceiling, roots in her bag, pulls out a big key (the<br />
type you&#039;ll find on teething rings) and mimes unlocking the door.<br />
<font color="red"> no successes, but i&#039;ll burn a glamour </font><br />
the door swings open.</p>
<p>"where to, gentlemen?" she looks at her watch "we have about 5 minutes to get out of here..."</p>
<p>they run out of the room, ilandra feeling abel&#039;s glares upon her as<br />
they do. she suddenly stops in the corridor and looks up, looking for<br />
something, the two men crash into her, not having had much notice of<br />
her stopping. she raises an arm, pointing at the green fire exit sign,<br />
"that way!" she shouts and they follow the arrows. reaching a fire<br />
escape door, she pushes the lever and they make it out of the warehouse.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As the doors swing open, Ilandra looks down to the watch in her hand<br />
just as the hand flicks over from "Safe" to "Unsafe".  It clicks<br />
for a few moments, and then is silent.</p>
<p>For another couple of seconds.</p>
<p>"WARNING!  WARNING!" the watch announces in a mechanical and<br />
exceptionally loud voice.  "Area is unsafe!  Make sure nobody<br />
notices you!"</p>
<p>"Fat chance of that," Ilandra replies to it.</p>
<p>"IN PARTICULAR," it responds even louder than before, "I WOULD<br />
RECCOMMEND KEEPING VERY QUIET!  THEY MIGHT HEAR YOU IF YOU START<br />
TALKING LIKE THAT, AND THAT WOULDN&#039;T BE GOOD, WOULD IT!?!"</p>
<p><font color="red">OOC: Ah, I love Gustaffsen&#039;s contraptions =p</font></p>
<p>As if in sympathy, the fire alarm bells begin to ring in the warehouse<br />
behind them.  They&#039;re only slightly louder than the watch.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"right, i have a plan..." she says to the two princes, "one of you,<br />
silence this thing... but first, there is a fence there... i say we run<br />
and jump it. cain, much as this next sentence pains and hurts my very<br />
nature, i am sorry, truly actually sorry for making you walk into a<br />
wall in a fuddled state... just that you haven&#039;t had years of practice<br />
of avoiding my schemes. so i suggest we run, and run now, cos the<br />
hummums are really close."</p>
<p>she looks at abel, as if seeking his approval, he merely nods and says<br />
"i&#039;m still going to be having a word with you later... now come on,<br />
look lively" as gracefully as a gazelle he and cain start running. she<br />
looks around and morphs into a cat (keeping her clothes) and follows<br />
them.</p>
<p><i>abel always seems to need to have a word with me these days... and i<br />
think i&#039;ve really offended cain... and this whole thing was my idea...<br />
oh gods!!! regara&#039;s gonna make me into a kitty-cushion for her to sit<br />
on on her throne! i better start behaving like they do, cos otherwise<br />
i&#039;ll be in trouble...</i>  as she reaches and climbs the barrier, she resolves to be as dignified throughout this trip as the two princes</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The two princes take a run-up and, in synchrony, jump up... up, and<br />
further up, clearing the top of the ten-foot fence seemingly without<br />
effort.  They each landed cleanly the other side, throwing up<br />
small plumes of dust as they did.  Whilst Abel carried on running<br />
straight ahead, Cain turned to see Ilandra, in cat-form, scrabbling up<br />
the fence on the other side.</p>
<p>"Don&#039;t wait for me!" he called to his brother, as he sprinted back to the fence and began to climb his side.</p>
<p>Once at the top, he gingerly reached over and picked up the feline<br />
Ilandra as she finally got near enough to the top of the fence.<br />
With her safely in his arms, he jumped down again - gracefully as<br />
always - and ran after his brother.</p>
<p>Several minutes later, the trees had thickened on either side of them<br />
and there was no longer any visible sign of the all-too-human warehouse<br />
they had left behind.  Still audible, though, were the wailing of<br />
the building&#039;s fire alarm, the sirens of emergency vehicles drawing up<br />
outside, and the muffled protests of the watch buried deep inside<br />
Cain&#039;s coat pockets.</p>
<p>Once they were sure they were far enough away, the two men paused to<br />
catch their breath.  Which - oddly for a human but almost<br />
expectedly for a Sidhe - happened almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>Cain placed Ilandra on the ground, disengaging her claws from his coat.</p>
<p>"Now then," Abel said calmly, "Wasn&#039;t that fun."  He looked down<br />
to face Ilandra.  "Were you planning on causing any more mischief?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>in a flicker, ilandra becomes human-shaped and looking slightly sad but<br />
still really proud of herself, she pulls out a litre tub of ben &amp;<br />
jerry&#039;s from her bag. "it&#039;s regara&#039;s favourite flavour, i figured this<br />
way she won&#039;t make me into a cat fur cushion to sit upon till the end<br />
of time. now, i vote we go home so you get get the talking to done<br />
with. and cain, give this to your mother to apologise for making her<br />
worry about you two... i&#039;m going to be too busy apologizing to abel to<br />
do so myself"</p>
<p>cain gingerly took the ice cream from ilandra, who seemed to be bracing<br />
herself for something. "right, abel, let&#039;s get this show on the road"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel smiled, feeling oddly proud of Ilandra&#039;s foresight.  Yes,<br />
there most certainly would be a lot of talking to do when they got<br />
home.  Not quite in the way Ilandra expected, though, for it<br />
dawned on Abel that with just one little observation in the right place<br />
not only would everything work out for the best, but the punishment<br />
would fit the crime most amusingly.</p>
<p>"Indeed," Abel said, and his eyes glowed, and the stones glowed, and<br />
the world glowed, and with a sickening jolt they were standing in his<br />
bedroom in Castle Poppy once more.</p>
<p>"Now then, Ilandra, you head back to your room.  Cain and I will<br />
apologise to the Duchess and give her the ice cream before it melts,<br />
and then...  Well, I&#039;ll come and have a word with you in a bit."</p>
<p>"Hurry along now," Abel whispered into Ilandra&#039;s ear.  "The charm will wear off in a few minutes&#039; time."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>upon reaching her room, Ilandra started to pack things and, taking a well worn notepad out of her bag, began to write a note.</p>
<p>"<b>From the desk of <s>Lord Lysander Honeysuckle</s></b> ilandra</p>
<p>dear house poppy,<br />

our houses and am returning to mine, wherever the soldiers happened to<br />

meanwhile thankyou regara for your hospitalitality. and i shall perhaps see you in my next form.<br />
yours sincerely,<br />

<p>the rest of that sentence was obscured by tear marks.<br />
she propped this up on her pillow with the red stone abel had given her to hold it in place.</p>
<p>she exited through the main gate, and in a flash seemed to vanish off<br />
the face of poppy land. the last sound you could hear from her was<br />
"SANCTUARY!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Duchess Regara&#039;s throne room, Cain and Abel arrive.</p>
<p>"Ah," Regara says, shifting slightly on her plus-size throne.<br />
"Cain, Abel, good of you to come.  I suppose Azimov did find you<br />
in the end?"</p>
<p>"Azimov?"  Abel asks.  "I&#039;m afraid it was due to Ilandra that<br />
we came here."  At the mention of the name, Cain twitches slightly.</p>
<p>Recovering swiftly, Cain brings out the litre tub of ice cream from<br />
behind his back and presents it to his mother, who can hardly contain<br />
her glee.</p>
<p>"Mister Chicken!" she bellows.  "Bring me a spoon at once!"</p>
<p>The Duchess then turns back to her children.  "Ah, so I suppose it was Nyano who found this for me?"</p>
<p>"I&#039;m afraid not," Cain said.  "This was also thanks to Ilandra.  To...  Ilandra...  Ilandra."</p>
<p>"Ah," Abel whispered to himself.  "Time&#039;s up."</p>
<p>Cain dropped to his knees on the floor, back to the same deep shade of<br />
red that he had gone earlier.  "She..." he muttered.<br />
"Ilandra.  Ilandra... kissed me..."</p>
<p>Regara&#039;s motherly hearing kicked in at just the right moment.</p>
<p>"Kissed you?  Oh, did she indeed!"</p>
<p>Mister Chicken, who had made it halfway across the room, was stunned<br />
enough - whether by the volume or by the revelation itself - that he<br />
sent the spoon clattering to the floor.</p>
<p>"So, Cain dear," she continued in a much quieter voice.  "How was it?"</p>
<p>Regara grinned, truly a sight to be seen.</p>
<p>Cain stuttered, unable to produce any words besides "I", "Um" and "Er".</p>
<p>"You love her, don&#039;t you?"</p>
<p>A few seconds of silence followed, ended by Cain&#039;s quiet "yes".</p>
<p>"And she is certainly quite taken with you, dear, wouldn&#039;t you say?"</p>
<p>Cain nodded feebly, whilst his brother stood beside him and shared a knowing wink with their mother.</p>
<p>"Ah, what it is to be young and in love," Regara mused.  "Well<br />
then.  I see our celebration tonight will be doubly worth<br />
celebrating!"</p>
<p>"Doubly...?" Cain asked.</p>
<p>"What with our return to our home after all this time, <i>and</i> news of an impending marriage in the family, we&#039;d better make it a night to remember!"</p>
<p>"M...marriage?"</p>
<p>And, with that, Cain fell over backwards and passed out.</p>
<p>"Oh deary me." Regara whispered to her remaining conscious son.<br />
"Better get him back to his room and woken up, or else he&#039;ll never be<br />
ready for tonight!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Having lain his brother down on his bed and instructed the servants as<br />
to what to do when he regained consciousness, Abel headed off to<br />
Ilandra&#039;s room to give her the promised lecture about the use of<br />
mind-muddling cantrips on her own friends.</p>
<p>Sadly, what he found when he opened the door to her room was not at all<br />
what he was expecting.  The walls were bare, the cupboards empty<br />
and hanging open, the bed made.  Everything was arranged neatly,<br />
as if the room were nothing but an infreqently-used guest room; the<br />
only anomaly a hastily-written letter lying on the pillow.</p>
<p>Abel read it, his heart sinking with every sentence.  "Confess?" he muttered.  "Shame?  Don&#039;t follow me?"</p>
<p>For a few moments after he finished reading, he stood staring at the<br />
letter.  Then, as if some inaudible sound had jolted him from his<br />
reverie, he stuffed it into his pocket and ran all the way across the<br />
castle to Cain&#039;s room.</p>
<p>Barging open the door, he shook his brother by the shoulders until he<br />
finally stirred.  "Read this," he said, pressing the letter into<br />
Cain&#039;s hand then turning to leave even before he received a<br />
response.  "See you in the stable yard in five minutes."</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Five minutes later to the second, Cain shoulder-barged open the doors to the yard and almost ran straight into Abel.</p>
<p>"Get on," Abel said, handing Cain the reins of his horse.</p>
<p>It was only by the time they were already on their way that Cain<br />
finally had the chance to take stock of his situation.  Somehow,<br />
Abel seemed to have managed to put together a hunting party in five<br />
minutes - no doubt aided by Regara&#039;s persuasion.  Leading their<br />
party was Nyano-Sgiathatch, the chief scout of House Poppy&#039;s remaining<br />
army, inexplicably managing to ride despite the difficulty of holding<br />
the reins in his claws.  He and Abel rode next, and behind them<br />
was Poppy&#039;s head huntsman, who seemed to be clucthing a blunderbuss<br />
with a worrying amount of zeal.  Behind them, brining up the rear<br />
of the group, were five horsemen of Poppy&#039;s army - all that could be<br />
spared, Cain assumed, in times like these.</p>
<p>By the time Cain had finished his review of their party, they had<br />
already reached a gallop and were speeding off in the direction of the<br />
Honeysuckle lands.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"welcome home, <i>duchess</i>"<br />
her butler greeted her, handing her a pair of bunny slippers and some<br />
hot chocolate with marshmallows in it. "Grizzel is out in his shed and<br />
has expressed the desire to see you again. I hope you haven&#039;t been<br />
causing too much trouble young lady, your parents would disapprove."</p>
<p>"Catkin, you know not to call me that... and yes, i caused much mayhem.<br />
i suggest you prepare a few extra bedrooms and place the house closer<br />
to house poppy than usual... i kissed their prince and have returned<br />
home to prepare myself for whatever punishments it may entail. isn&#039;t it<br />
cunning? returning to neutral ground so they can&#039;t harm me. either way,<br />
i&#039;ll be visiting Grizzel and Lysander&#039;s grave. If nothing else, i have<br />
to apologize to him." she hugs Catkin (the butler) and runs out of the<br />
main hall, her dress becoming more suffused with the house colours as<br />
she progresses.</p>
<p>"GRIZZEL!!!" she cries, seeing the grizzled mane of her head of<br />
security "GRIZZEL!!! I&#039;M BACK!!! LANNY&#039;S BACK!!!" he turns, with a grin<br />
on his wizened face and his arms outspread.</p>
<p>"my little princess! you came back! and what mischief have you caused?"<br />
he picked up Ilandra and swung her round as a parent would to a<br />
ten-year-old. "how was house poppy?"</p>
<p>"house poppy doesn&#039;t need me back. you will need to be on duty this<br />
evening, i kissed cain and fuddled him cos i can&#039;t fuddle myself and<br />
got into trouble. and i couldn&#039;t wipe abel&#039;s memory cos he&#039;s good at<br />
ignoring me. so now lots of house poppy people are coming and i need<br />
the cantrip that makes it look like the house is speaking to be<br />
performed cos if they have muskets it&#039;ll be scary. anyways... i have to<br />
go to my room to make myself pretty and weave some honeysuckles into my<br />
hair and then i have a brother to visit." she hugged her head of<br />
security/ ex-nanny and ran into the house.</p>
<p>a few minutes later she emerged, in a yellow, honeysuckle coloured<br />
dress with pink and yellow honeysuckles weaved into her hair, running<br />
towards the cemetery at the edge of the land. upon reaching it she<br />
slowed her pace and knelt down and touched the ground, where her hand<br />
was, a honeysuckle emerged. she picked it up and went to kneel by her<br />
brother&#039;s grave.</p>
<p>"lysander, i know you&#039;ve moved on into another shell... but this makes<br />
me feel better" she started, the same way she normally did. and told<br />
him everything that happened. "i think he hates me, which breaks my<br />
heart. however, the trap is set, should he appear here i&#039;ll know how he<br />
feels. and now i&#039;m duchess and i guess i&#039;ll have to accept my rank."<br />
she sighs "i wish you hadn&#039;t died. you gave good advice, and you taught<br />
me how to fuddle people properly. i reckon you&#039;d have been proud! i not<br />
only fuddled a sidhe, but i fuddled a sidhe with my first kiss." she<br />
started to cry and gave up on trying to talk to the gravestone. around<br />
her honeysuckles grew tall and proud, blooming and intoxicating all<br />
passers-by with their sweet scent.</p>
<p>after a half hour or so, ilandra returned to house honeysuckle no<br />
longer a princess. upon opening the door, a carpet of pink and yellow<br />
blossoms announced her arrival. today, she was damned well going to be<br />
duchess ilandra, ruler of honeysuckle. after all, she&#039;d earnt it and it<br />
was about time she took up the throne. she looked up at the portrait of<br />
the former duke and duchess, with a hint of guilt that it had taken her<br />
76 years to decide she was ready to be duchess. as if in recognition of<br />
this, the servants bowed down before her.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Back on the forested path leading away from Castle Poppy, Abel had<br />
pulled up alongside Nyano and was talking to him as quietly as he could<br />
given the five-foot height difference between them and the continual<br />
clattering of unshod horses&#039; hooves.</p>
<p>With a flick of his tail, Nyano beckoned forth one of the soliders from<br />
the back of the group.  He rode on Abel&#039;s other side, and the<br />
three of them talked between each other for a minute or so.</p>
<p>Once their conversation seemed to reach a conclusion, Abel passed a<br />
flower - a honeysuckle - to the soldier.  Then, he jumped up so<br />
that he was standing almost impossibly on top of the saddle, and turned<br />
to address the group.</p>
<p>"My friends," he shouted, "thank you for coming with us at such short<br />
notice!  I&#039;m sure word has got around by now of exactly why we&#039;re<br />
doing this, so I&#039;ll keep it short!  In fact, I&#039;ll keep this whole<br />
journey short!  Luckily, while we were away, there were a few<br />
Poppy folk that tended to our gardens, and kept all our flowers<br />
alive!  Of course, there was plenty of honeysuckle!"</p>
<p>Abel waited a few seconds for the urgent discussions of the other<br />
members of the party to die down.  Cain said nothing, though - his<br />
heart was beating loudly enough to him as to drown out everyone else&#039;s<br />
conversation.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m sure you all know what that means, and why the Corporal is riding<br />
with us!" Abel continued over the continuing din.  "So, Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen - hold on tight!"</p>
<p>So saying, he dropped back into his saddle, facing forwards<br />
again.  The soldier to whom he had given the flower accelerated<br />
until he was a good twenty feet in front of the rest of the riders, and<br />
then...</p>
<p>Sparks began to fly from the hooves of his horse, stopping not as soon<br />
as they touched the ground but extending, branching out and crackling<br />
across each rider behind him in turn until their horses struck sparks<br />
from the earthy ground as well, ever increasing and intensifying until<br />
all around the riders the air felt thick and hot and sparks of glamour<br />
coruscated around each of them.</p>
<p>As if the storm of magic had reached some unattainable height, a single<br />
bolt of whatever-it-was descended from the sky, and the world went<br />
white with flecks of flashing silver.</p>
<p>The next thing any of them knew, their horses rode on a wide road<br />
running up to the borders of the lands of House Honeysuckle, still<br />
striking sparks until their riders reined them in.</p>
<p>The group stopped short of the border, and Abel glanced at his brother.  He was shaking.</p>
<p>"Well then," Abel muttered to himself.  "It had best be me, then."</p>
<p>Abel climbed down from the saddle, and walked the few steps to where he felt the border to be.</p>
<p>There was no-one inside the Honeysuckle lands as far as he could see, and that threw him somewhat.</p>
<p>"Hello?" he asked into the void.  "Is anyone there?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"YOU HAVE ENTERED NEUTRAL GROUND! PLEASE PUT DOWN ALL YOUR WEAPONS AND<br />
LEAVE YOUR HORSES OUTSIDE!" the cottage boomed, in a voice uncannily<br />
like Ilandra&#039;s. "ALSO, STATE YOUR PURPOSE."</p>
<p>Abel rolled his eyes, "we have come to see princess Ilandra"</p>
<p>a couple of stable boys appeared as if by magic and started to collect<br />
the horses and weapons. as if clearing the visitors for entrance.</p>
<p>"THERE IS NO LONGER A PRINCESS IN THIS HOUSE." said the cottage. "what<br />
do you mean cain is there? oh ok... eek i just said all that to the<br />
megaphone. damn. LOOK, JUST COME IN SEAT YOURSELVES AND HELP YOURSELVES<br />
TO THE FOOD. not like i care who&#039;s outside or anything..."</p>
<p>the troop were ushered into a large drawing room and informed that the<br />
duchess would be with them shortly. this bewildered quite a few of<br />
them, not to mention the two princes. after a few minutes, a sweet<br />
smell wafted into the room and honeysuckles started randomly sprouting<br />
up around cain accompanied by cursing and questions to the butler along<br />
the lines of "how can i make it stop? make it stop!! stop it!!!<br />
aaargh!!!" she walked in, as dignified as anyone can be while blushing<br />
so red it clashes with their dress. "hi!" she smiled at them all. "i<br />
hope you realise, abel, that this is neutral ground and my own house so<br />
you can&#039;t turn me into regara&#039;s latest scarf."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Scarf?" Abel asked.  "Goodness me, no.  We came to deliver you your nervous wreck of a boyfriend!"</p>
<p>Abel elbowed his brother in the ribs.  "Come on, aren&#039;t you even going to say hello?"</p>
<p>Cain looked up at Ilandra, and... stopped.  And stared.  And said "Erk".</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>She raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow (a girl has to get pretty for<br />
these things ya know) "&#039;erk?&#039; Dare i ask why? What&#039;s going on? I can&#039;t<br />
handle this duchessing... it&#039;s too full of looking pretty, glowing and<br />
sounding a lot more confident than i really am. Deliver? What has<br />
regara got planned?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Our mother&#039;s just doing what she thinks is best," Abel replied.<br />
He nudged Cain again.  "Get on with it!" he whispered.</p>
<p>"Right, right," Cain muttered, pushing his chair back and standing<br />
unsteadily.  He made his way slowly, shaking with each step, to<br />
the entrance of the room.</p>
<p>He stood before Ilandra, now Duchess Honeysuckle, and her flowers began to grow around both of them.</p>
<p>"Ilandra..." Cain said, his nervousness obvious to the entire room.  "Duchess Ilandra.  I, um..."</p>
<p>He shot a glance at his brother, who was attempting to give subtle<br />
thumbs-up signals.  He managed the &#039;thumbs-up signals&#039; part, at<br />
least.</p>
<p>Cain turned back to Ilandra, and his gaze locked with hers.  For a<br />
few moments he remained, staring into her eyes, before he dropped to<br />
one knee, took her hand in his, and kissed it.</p>
<p>"Ilandra...  Will you marry me?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra&#039;s world started spinning, the house&#039;s security system started<br />
going berserk and tendrils of honeysuckle plants wrapped themselves<br />
around the guest&#039;s feet.<br />
"yes" she managed to whisper before passing out and landing in his arms.</p>
<p>Grizzel ran into the room, a few seconds later shouting at the top of<br />
his voice "LANNY!!! WHO&#039;S HURTING YOU? I&#039;LL GET THEM GOOD!!! NO-ONE<br />
CAUSES ANY HONEYSUCKLE PAIN WITHIN THESE WALLS WITHOUT MY APPROVAL!!!"<br />
he blinked, saw the scene in front of him and waved all the tendrils<br />
off the guests. "so sorry about that... just that the houses systems<br />
are going haywire... dare i ask what&#039;s going on?"</p>
<p>Abel smiled, knowingly "she&#039;ll be fine, she&#039;s missing the party of the year."</p>
<p>"ok, take her to the party, but make sure she&#039;s ok. and keep her away from that cain fellow... he&#039;s a bad influence."</p>
<p>"too late, she just got engaged to him" Abel replied. "so, see you<br />
soon. can i assume we&#039;re next to house poppy&#039;s gates? and don&#039;t worry,<br />
i promised i&#039;d look after her."</p>
<p>they were in fact just outside the gates to house poppy. the group<br />
trooped out, with their horses in tow. a slightly less nervous than<br />
before cain now carrying a still unconscious ilandra through the gates.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Duchess Regara almost choked on the last of her Cookie Dough ice cream<br />
as the party trooped in through the main doorway of the great hall.</p>
<p>"Mum," Cain said, showing an uncharacteristic confidence, "I&#039;d like you<br />
to meet my new fiance.  Duchess Honeysuckle.  Better make<br />
that a <i>triple</i> celebration tonight?"</p>
<p>And, with that and Regara&#039;s stunned silence, he left.  The rest of<br />
the group were left looking uneasy, unsure as to exactly what had just<br />
happened.</p>
<p>Once the doors had shut behind Cain, Regara grinned and winked at Abel.</p>
<p>"I never thought it&#039;d be that quick!" the Duchess Regara said.  "My, doesn&#039;t time fly?"</p>
<p>"Certainly does," Abel replied.</p>
<p>"Duchess Honeysuckle, though," the Duchess Poppy mused.  "I hope<br />
that girl knows what&#039;s in store for her.  I hope Cain does, too!"</p>
<p>"Oh, and Mister Chicken?" she called, as the group turned to<br />
leave.  "Could you get somebody to clear up all the honeysuckle<br />
petals from the floor?"</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cain carried the still-unconscious Ilandra back to her old<br />
room, still somewhat bare since she had left a mere hour before.</p>
<p>An hour!  To Cain, as he laid Ilandra on her bed and sat beside her until she woke, it felt like years.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>After a spell of time, Ilandra came to. She raised an arm in defiance<br />
and declared "I&#039;ll always be a honeysuckle!!! &#039;til the day I die!!" The<br />
news hit her again and again she passed out. The other people in the<br />
room watched as yet again, the little duchess came to, more disoriented<br />
this time. "What? Did what i think just happened happen?"<br />
She looked around, finding herself in a knee deep room of honeysuckle<br />
plants... every available surface was covered in them. It was then that<br />
she saw the rest of the people in the room. Pulling herself together in<br />
as graceful a way she could, she smiled sweetly.<br />
"Sorry about that..." she said, sitting up. "So, where&#039;s the party? And<br />
can someone get it in writing that regara won&#039;t use me as a scarf?"</p>
<p>Cain chuckled, clearly Ilandra hadn&#039;t been changed by her new position.<br />
He still felt quite nervous around her, but figured it would pass<br />
eventually. Abel merely rolled his eyes, handing her a piece of paper<br />
he&#039;d prepared earlier.</p>
<p>On it was:<br />
"I, Regara, Duchess of Poppy, do hereby promise not to turn Ilandra of House Honeysuckle into a cat-skin scarf"</p>
<p>"It&#039;s in your writing, abel." she said sniffily. "It doesn&#039;t mean she won&#039;t"</p>
<p>"Ah, but you brought ice cream, and ice cream is good" a female<br />
voice,which turned out to be Regara herself, interjected. "And besides,<br />
you&#039;re marrying my son... we&#039;ll be related soon... i can&#039;t harbour a<br />
wish to kill a member of my family!" The words seemed to drip and ooze<br />
sugar as she spoke them.</p>
<p>The colour drained from ilandra&#039;s face, <i>oh gods, she&#039;s going to<br />
want to be involved at every step of the way... aaargh! oh well at<br />
least she can&#039;t kill me for commenting on that splodge of ice cream</i></p>
<p>"Regara dear, you have a massive splodge of ice cream on your face...<br />
perhaps you should learn moderation when eating ice cream..." Ilandra<br />
braced herself to run as... wait for it... there.<br />
Regara exploded in a fountain of rage.</p>
<p>"WHY YOU LITTLE!!!" Ilandra pegged it from the room at full pelt, barely stopping to shrug at Cain, Regara followed.<br />
"you know, Regara, running so soon after eating gives you heartburn..."</p>
<p>[<font>Private to<br />
Storyteller: i figured ilandra just wouldn&#039;t be able to resist and if<br />
you feel the need to cull any of this post please do... i tried to keep<br />
as much of it in character for the individual characters as possible...</font>]</p>

<p>Fortunately for the new Duchess Honeysuckle, outrunning her Poppy<br />
counterpart was not a particularly epic feat.  Ilandra, Cain and<br />
Abel sped away from Regara, leaving her panting breathless behind them.</p>
<p>Once they were a few corridors&#039; lengths away from their pursuer, Cain stopped and turned to his fiance.</p>
<p>"Far enough, do you reckon?"</p>
<p>Abel stopped too.  "Well, at least it&#039;s good to see the responsibilities of your new position haven&#039;t got to you yet!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"it&#039;ll never be far enough... she will find us in about 10minutes..." a<br />
slightly breathless ilandra panted... "especially while i leave a<br />
trail" she pointed, indicating the outcropping of honeysuckle that was<br />
adorning the hallways leading to their hiding place.</p>
<p>Abel rolled his eyes. "i suppose you&#039;ll be suggesting we find a new hiding place soon, right? unless you can stop the flowers"</p>
<p>Cain looked thoughtful, which according to Ilandra was one of the<br />
cutest expressions he had. "the flowers only affect the things she<br />
touches, right? if i pick her up, like so" he put her over his shoulder<br />
in a fireman&#039;s lift, much to her indignation and protests. "and if i<br />
run anywhere, the flowers won&#039;t appear, right?" without waiting for an<br />
answer cain started running, with an indignated ilandra pounding his<br />
back and demanding to be put down loudly as he sped off towards his<br />
tower. just as well cain ran, regara was just rounding the corner.</p>
<p>"GET BACK HERE!!! YOU&#039;VE GONE TOO FAR THIS TIME, I WON&#039;T STAND FOR YOU<br />
GETTING MY SON TO HELP YOU GET AWAY!!! abel, darling, how would you<br />
like to help mummy? cos mummy&#039;s very tired... and she needs to teach<br />
somebody a lesson."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Abel sighed. "No, mother, I cannot carry you. They&#039;ve probably gone to<br />
Cain&#039;s room. I didn&#039;t particularly want to follow, besides I really<br />
need to finish that book. I&#039;ll come down for the party."<br />
Saying that, Abel turned and walked off down the hallway.</p>
<p>Regara sighed. "I guess a mother&#039;s got to do what a mother&#039;s got to do..." she started jogging again.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the corridor which housed cain&#039;s room she was greeted by<br />
what could only be described as a small jungle of honeysuckles and<br />
poppys. The corridor was beginning to look like a small glade... except<br />
less diverse. She smiled grimly, pulled herself together and knocked on<br />
the door. "Oh Caaaaiiin... the party&#039;s starting in about 10 minutes and<br />
I want everyone there. Especially the two of you..."</p>
<p>Deep inside Cain&#039;s room, conversations that needed to take place took<br />
place and the young couple decided upon the fate of house honeysuckle...</p>
<p><font color="red"> ooc: i shall leave it up to you to decide what they actually do... though they did need to talk quite a bit... </font></p>
