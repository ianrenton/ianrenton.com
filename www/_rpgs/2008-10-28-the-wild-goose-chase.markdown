<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>As she caught up to Ilandra and Cain, Akane was running possibilities<br />
through her mind. "We need to search all the castle, as quickly as<br />
possible, starting with all the places Regara might be and all the<br />
exits they might have used to remove the Duchess. We&#039;d manage it faster<br />
if we split up, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a good idea - if they managed<br />
to subdue someone as...erm, formidable as Regara, they&#039;ll be very good<br />
at what they do, so better to trust to our numbers.<br />
"I&#039;ll take point; Abel, follow me and tell me what the best route is;<br />
then Ilandra; Cain, you keep an eye out behind us and make sure<br />
nobody&#039;s sneaking up," she finished. "We&#039;ll start with the front door<br />
as the most obvious exit - the guard there was nearly asleep when I<br />
came in, so it&#039;s possible they removed her that way. With any luck,<br />
though, we&#039;ll find her in her rooms and it&#039;ll turn out I&#039;m just<br />
paranoid," she muttered, walking towards the front door, hand on her<br />
gun under her coat.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"formidable, don&#039;t you mean fat?" Ilandra asked of her cousin.<br />
"Anyways, I think we oughtta go to the ground floor bathroom first,<br />
just to make sure she hasn&#039;t gone to purge..." Ilandra pointed towards<br />
it and started running, then tripped on Cain&#039;s trousers and fell<br />
unceremoniously at a servants&#039; feet.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane groaned. "That&#039;s it, you&#039;re cutting the trousers, getting Cain to<br />
give you a piggyback ride, or going furry, we can&#039;t afford to have you<br />
fall on your face. And we&#039;re going to the gate. If she&#039;s throwing up,<br />
then she&#039;s fine and nothing&#039;s happened to her; if we act on the<br />
assumption that they&#039;ve taken her, we may catch them in time to stop<br />
them."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p><i> if i cut the trousers Cain&#039;ll get angry cos they&#039;re his... if i go<br />
furry i won&#039;t see very much... but if i get a piggy back i get an<br />
excuse to cuddle him... well, it&#039;s not a hard decision really</i></p>
<p>She looked up to Cain as innocently as possible. "Could I get a ride?"<br />
she asked, then giggled as the double-entendre dawned on her. She<br />
picked herself up gingerly, amazed at how much her hands stung and<br />
climbed onto Cain&#039;s back.</p>
<p>"Right," Ilandra said, looking at Akane. "Happy now? Poor Cain has to carry me cos I stole his trousers..."</p>
<p>They set off in the direction of the doors, Ilandra clinging tightly to<br />
Cain as she was unused to the height and occasionally poking him to<br />
pick her legs up a bit as she was slipping.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p><font color="red">OC: Right, since allegedly you&#039;re heading to the castle gates...</font></p>
<p>The four of them reached the gates of Castle Poppy at a run, only to<br />
discover that no-one they passed quite shared their enthusiasm -<br />
particularly the gate guards themselves, who were quietly grumbling<br />
about having to stay outside rather than joining in the party.</p>
<p>When questioned, they professed no knowledge of the Duchess&#039;<br />
whereabouts.  "Ain&#039;t seen &#039;er in hours, Miss," being the exact<br />
words of the more surly-looking of the two, who seemed not only<br />
offended that he was not at the party but that the questioning was<br />
cutting into his all-important smoking time.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p><i>Right</i>, Akane thought to herself. <i>The gate guards weren&#039;t<br />
taken out by force. Possibilities include: the other gates; drugged and<br />
smuggled out; or, they were after something else. It is unlikely that<br />
she was taken out this way though; anybody carrying a Regara-sized box<br />
would surely have been noticed.</i> "You haven&#039;t seen anybody suspicious leaving the castle?" she asked.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Not at all, Miss," the other guard replied.  "No-one &#039;cept us &#039;as<br />
been though these gates, in or out, &#039;cept those Honeysuckle folk that<br />
came in wi&#039; the Prince there a while back."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>From her vantage point, Ilandra looked like the cat that got the cream<br />
and the choice cut of chicken, she bent to Cain&#039;s ear and whispered<br />
"Can you carry me and my cousin, do you reckon?" an expression of doubt<br />
crossed his face and he shook his head. She straightened up a little,<br />
"ok then, we shall congregate in the main hallway next to the tapestry<br />
opposite the front door, last one there is a rotten egg. oh and to make<br />
it fair, abel has to carry Akane. Now run, Cain, run!"</p>
<p>Laughing a little, Cain started running towards the castle. Upon<br />
reaching the front doors, Ilandra jumped off and rummaged in her bag to<br />
find the set of keys that opened all the secret passageways. Having<br />
found them she went up to the tapestry and opened the wall behind the<br />
tapestry up to allow the others in too. She poked her head round the<br />
edge of the tapestry and waved them all into the passageway.</p>
<p>"Now, it&#039;s the second fireplace to the left... follow me." she said, taking the lead.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Wh...carry...no!" Akane spluttered, turning red. <i>I<br />
have a sneaking suspicion Ilandra&#039;s either trying to play matchmaker,<br />
or get me back for her winding up being carried by Cain... But, oh hell<br />
no. Too embarassing, dammit,</i> she decided, <i>I&#039;m getting out of this one, even if I have to run out.</i></p>
<p>She raised an eyebrow at Abel as Cain ran off carrying her cousin. "I<br />
don&#039;t know about you, but I&#039;m not inclined to play fair." She took off<br />
towards the tapestry at a run.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>They approached the fireplace, at which Ilandra took the keys out once<br />
more and unlocked the fireplace. She gestured for the others to wait a<br />
second and poked her head into the room.</p>
<p>"Regara? You in here?" she called into the room, sounding incredibly<br />
concerned. "Regara, please don&#039;t make me sing the song! I&#039;m worried<br />
about you, you&#039;ve been gone for ages and everyone&#039;s asking where you<br />
are... Hello?"</p>
<p>She ventured in, signalling for the others to proceed slowly behind<br />
her. At the very least they were going to make sure she wasn&#039;t dead in<br />
her room.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Ilandra stopped short upon entering the room, noticing its occupants -<br />
both, as she and Akane had hoped, the Duchess Regara, but also someone<br />
that none of them were expecting.  Elaine.</p>
<p>Their conversation stopped abruptly as Ilandra, Cain and Akane entered<br />
the room via the strangely-opening fireplace.  Elaine had pivoted<br />
on her chair in order to give the interlopers the iciest of stares,<br />
whilst Regara was already stomping across the room in their direction<br />
with a grim expression on her face.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Sensing she was about to get the telling off of a lifetime Ilandra<br />
dropped to her knees as low to the ground as her legs would allow.</p>
<p>"I am so sorry to intrude upon such important matters, my lady. We<br />
would not have undertaken such a foolish mission if we had not truly<br />
feared for your safety and I hope you can find it within yourself to<br />
forgive us for this rudeness." she said as politely as she could<br />
muster, still quite low to the ground. <font color="red"> one sucess... but it&#039;s better than nothing</font> "Besides, we thought you might have been kidnapped or worse."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Ilandra!" the Duchess bellowed.  "Whosoever taught you your<br />
manners, you should have had a better tutor!  The proper way to<br />
announce oneself is to go to the <i>door</i> and <i>knock</i>, not to crawl through one&#039;s <i>fireplace</i>!"</p>
<p>The Duchess clasped her head in her hands.</p>
<p>"By all rights, as the Duchess of another House I could well accuse you<br />
of espionage.  However, since you are still so young, and as you<br />
are engaged to be wed to my son," she said, causing Cain to take a step<br />
back towards the fireplace, "the following shall have to suffice.</p>
<p>"I am fine.  I have always been so, and always will be so.  Were I to be dead, you would <i>know</i>."<br />
The Duchess shot another look at Cain.  "Now, leave me in peace<br />
and rejoin the party.  I will return soon.  I trust all is<br />
going well?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra jumped up and, slipping a little, ran to hide behind Cain.</p>
<p>"well... there was a suspected poisoning but the medics have mostly<br />
taken care of that by the administration of glucose capsules." Ilandra<br />
replied from behind Cain, taking care to thrust the set of maid keys<br />
into his hand.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane grabbed at Ilandra&#039;s and Cain&#039;s shirts and hauled them back into the secret passage, which closed with a resounding clang.</p>
<p>"Ummm...she appears to be alive and well," she groaned. "Moments like<br />
that really make me question my sanity in being concerned about<br />
Regara&#039;s health. She&#039;ll probably outlive us all <i>and</i> comandeer all the chocolate in Faerie. But... was that Elaine she was talking to? I really don&#039;t like that..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I don&#039;t like Elaine," Ilandra said, sulkily. "She had ill will towards<br />
me earlier... red streaks coming towards me and Nyano. All we&#039;d done<br />
was merely stand up for what we believed in. I don&#039;t think she&#039;s good<br />
people." Ilandra grabbed at Cain&#039;s shirt a little tighter. "Whenever<br />
Elaine is around, bad stuff happens. I have a horrible feeling about<br />
what&#039;s going to happen." Ilandra felt Cain&#039;s arms wrapping protectively<br />
around her as she got more agitated.</p>
<p>Ilandra looked at Abel, who&#039;d remained in the corridor the entire time.</p>
<p>"You should get more involved with your house, you know. You&#039;re far<br />
better at politicking than I am, and you understand things better!" she<br />
nearly yelled at him, but remembered they were still just outside<br />
Regara&#039;s room. "We should get back to the party... preferably with some<br />
kind of pudding substance. What do you say, Akane?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>It wasn&#039;t hard for Akane to figure out the real source of Ilandra&#039;s<br />
agitation. "I doubt Regara would annul the engagement, given that if<br />
the marriage goes through she&#039;ll see both her sons as Dukes; but<br />
obviously she&#039;s not going to confide in you either, as she knows<br />
perfectly well that you wouldn&#039;t hide things from Ilandra," she<br />
finished with a nod at Cain.</p>
<p>"Love is like that," she grinned, remembering that one incident with<br />
the occultist who had believed in Faeries...shame she&#039;d had to pack up<br />
and leave soon after, before anybody noticed she wasn&#039;t aging, or<br />
something more might&#039;ve come of it. That and the fact that she&#039;d still<br />
been fixated on Lysander... She winced. <i>Bad train of thought. Bad!</i></p>
<p>"I assume, however, that Ilandra and I aren&#039;t alone in thinking that<br />
Elaine may be bad news. Like Ilandra said, bad things happen around<br />
her. That means somebody needs to find out what she was talking about<br />
with Regara." She turned and fixed Abel with a very pointed gaze.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"you think she wouldn&#039;t?" Ilandra asked, loosening her grip lightly.<br />
"Maybe next week we should go to the council and see what they have to<br />
say. Meanwhile, I think Akane&#039;s right, Abel, you should talk to your<br />
mother."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Yeah," Abel said.  "I know.  In the end it&#039;s her decision<br />
alone, but what with all that we&#039;ve learned on the road for so long I<br />
think she&#039;ll talk.  But given the topic of discussion, I suspect<br />
she&#039;ll only want to talk to Poppies about it - and ones that don&#039;t<br />
enter through the fireplace at that."</p>
<p>Abel glared at Cain, who gulped guiltily.</p>
<p>"Anyway, we can deal with this later.  She&#039;s sensible enough not to commit to anything tonight."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Hey! We were <i>worried</i>,<br />
dammit, and you&#039;ve gotta admit that with all the chaos tonight, the<br />
conclusions we came to may have been extreme, but they weren&#039;t entirely<br />
unjustified!" Akane glared at him, half embarassed and half annoyed.<br />
"First Ilandra sees something really messed up in the fatelines,<br />
apparently - you&#039;ll have to fill me in on that later, cousin - then we<br />
think we&#039;ve been poisoned, then your mother&#039;s gone, what <i>were</i> we to think?<br />
"In any case, I&#039;m sure Regara will decide what&#039;s best for her House,<br />
and we&#039;re not asking to be let in on what is only concerns your House<br />
and its members; but I keep having the nasty feeling that this woman&#039;s <i>wrong</i> somehow, and I don&#039;t want to see you all in danger. If you find out something like <i>that</i> - something that could be dangerous - then in that case I think it becomes important to non-Poppies as well."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"And how, pray tell, are we supposed to determine if the lady is<br />
&#039;somehow wrong&#039;?" asked Abel.  "She&#039;s trying to stop a war, but<br />
her methods are unorthodox.  What&#039;s the <i>orthodox</i><br />
way of stopping a war?  Clearly she&#039;s dangerous - anyone with<br />
connections to many houses is dangerous, and that includes us.<br />
But how do you propose determining whether she&#039;s &#039;wrong&#039; or not?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane sighed. "Look, if this is really a "get out of jail free" card<br />
that can save us all from this war, then I&#039;d be as happy as the next<br />
person (who isn&#039;t one of the Rose leaders) to see that become a reality.</p>
<p>"Do you know how long I spent in the human world, Abel? I was only gone from Faerie for three years, but I was there <i>a century</i>. Human <i>or</i> Faerie, I&#039;ve seen some fairly nasty things. I don&#039;t believe she&#039;s on the level because it&#039;s <i>never that easy</i>,<br />
offers like that just don&#039;t come without strings attached. I don&#039;t know<br />
what she wants from you or from us but I suspect it&#039;s more than she&#039;s<br />
saying. I can&#039;t believe she&#039;s just this kind soul who wants to keep us<br />
all from killing ourselves! <i>What&#039;s in it for her?</i></p>
<p>"Everybody has at least some ability to be dangerous, yes, but what I<br />
mean is not just that she has power but that I don&#039;t necessarily<br />
believe she won&#039;t misuse it. I wish I knew how to put my finger on that<br />
"feeling" I get, but as a general rule in my experience you only find<br />
out that sort of thing when it&#039;s way too late," she said, eyes blazing.</p>
<p>"Besides Ilandra and the Healers, you two are the closest thing to<br />
family I have left, and if I&#039;m being cynical and suspicious it&#039;s only<br />
because the things I&#039;ve seen make me believe that&#039;s how the world<br />
works, and while I&#039;d really like to be wrong about this, I&#039;m very much<br />
afraid that this is going to turn around and bite us all in the ass and<br />
I really don&#039;t want that!" she finished, out of breath.</p>
<p><i>((Ranting ftw! I hope I managed to convey the fact that she&#039;s more worried than angry.))</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra glared at Abel. "I can&#039;t believe how harsh you are, c&#039;mon,<br />
let&#039;s go to one of your rooms and I&#039;ll tell you guys something I<br />
haven&#039;t told anyone yet."</p>
<p>She walked three doors up, gestured at a door and said, "Cain&#039;s room<br />
will have to do." then took the keys from his unresisting hand.</p>
<p>Having let themselves in, they all settled down on the many chairs lying around and Ilandra started.</p>
<p>"As you guys know, I can see fate lines. Now, earlier when I looked at<br />
Elaine she had a massive trunk of them that seemed to vanish into a<br />
massive black void. Not as if she were eating them, but as if the<br />
person she&#039;s associated with was taking steps to ensure people didn&#039;t<br />
figure out who or what he was." she told them, fidgetting nervously<br />
with the cuffs of the shirt she was wearing. "Anyway, she was feeling<br />
very friendly towards Regara. As though she wants something. Now, I&#039;m<br />
not one to stop Regara making friends, but I don&#039;t trust anything that<br />
has fate lines leading to a vortex... it just seems, I don&#039;t know...<br />
off."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, of course she wants something from Regara," said Abel.<br />
"She wants the Poppies to pull out of the war, we know that.  And<br />
you&#039;re <i>surprised</i> that someone&#039;s trying to conceal Elaine&#039;s associations?  They&#039;re called the <i>Black Rose Committee</i>!"</p>
<p>"Look," he continued, "I&#039;m not saying I agree with Elaine&#039;s philosophy,<br />
I&#039;m just...  What&#039;s the human expression for it?"  He paused<br />
for a moment.  "Devil&#039;s Advocaat.  That&#039;s it, I&#039;m the Devil&#039;s<br />
Advocaat.  Except I&#039;m probably not so alcoholic.  Anyway, my<br />
point is just that we should think logically about this.  Perhaps<br />
if we could work out whether she has an ulterior motive to stopping the<br />
war, and how she intends to associate with Houses that do pull out,<br />
we&#039;d be in a better position to decide what to do."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane twiched. "For the love of all gods please don&#039;t mention those<br />
things, that was an extremely bad Yule! ...And, um, anyway. I&#039;m not<br />
suggesting you don&#039;t pull out of the war, if that&#039;s what you decide to<br />
do and you&#039;re willing to deal with the consequences of antagonising the<br />
Red Roses. What I&#039;m saying is that you shouldn&#039;t trust them, but also<br />
that you shouldn&#039;t rely on them.</p>
<p>"That Chrysanthemum Prince told me they don&#039;t so much have an army, as<br />
more Agents - people like her. He said it like those people are <i>weapons</i>;<br />
but if that&#039;s the case, we don&#039;t know who forged them, or who&#039;s<br />
wielding them, or for what purpose. I don&#039;t trust weapons that can<br />
think for themselves; they&#039;re too unpredictable.</p>
<p>"Tell me, if both sides lay down arms... &#039;Who will be king hereafter?&#039;<br />
Whatever promises they make to protect you will be secondary to that<br />
unknown ultimate allegiance. Surely they have <i>some</i> plan for the throne of Faerie. I&#039;d like to believe it doesn&#039;t concern us, but unfortunately that concerns <i>everyone</i>.</p>
<p>"By all means let&#039;s think logically about this. But logic doesn&#039;t tend to give you answers unless you have information."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked thoughtful at Akane&#039;s words. "You make a good point.<br />
What do you think, Cain? You&#039;ve been awfully silent throughout all of<br />
this..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain looked surprised, as if he was hoping he could have let this conversation go by without having to disagree with someone.</p>
<p>"I...  Akane made a good point.  If the Committee make it to<br />
their goal of stopping the war, there&#039;s still no royalty.  There&#039;s<br />
the Council I guess, but I...  I don&#039;t know, maybe the Black Roses<br />
already have support from them for... something.  Regardless of<br />
that, Arcadia needs a figurehead, King or Queen or both, otherwise<br />
there&#039;ll just be another war.  What I&#039;d really like to know is<br />
what they&#039;ll do about that."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane nodded. "They must have some plan, either to replace the monarchs<br />
or to...do away with them. Many human states have elected officials and<br />
little or no hereditary nobility; but, much as I can see its advantages<br />
as well as its disadvantages, I&#039;m not sure that would work in Faerie.<br />
Certainly not now. And in all cases where a human nation moved from a<br />
monarchy to another form of government, it tended to be a long and<br />
bloody transition.</p>
<p>"If the four of us here agree that, beyond taking care of our<br />
individual houses, we also want peace, then the point isn&#039;t just to end<br />
the war and the killing, but to prevent it from starting up again."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Very well," said Abel, "even I agree with that.  But how can that<br />
possibly be achieved?  Not that anyone will enjoy me saying this,<br />
but the easiest way to end this war with a monarchy is to vastly under-<br />
or over-power one of the alliances, such that one side easily defeats<br />
the other."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"I don&#039;t think they&#039;re targeting any one side," Akane shrugged, "That<br />
Chrysanthemum ponce also told me that Hyacinth and Daffodil were<br />
preparing to pull out, and we&#039;ll find out soon enough if he was telling<br />
the truth on that. In all honesty, though, I don&#039;t think the Red and<br />
White Roses will <i>ever</i><br />
stop fighting, even if both sides lose all allies. The Black Roses must<br />
have some kind of plan - like a contender for the throne that nobody<br />
would contest."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Is there even such a person?" asked Abel.  "The Houses are all polarised one way or other, and there&#039;s no House that <i>everybody</i> likes.  The old King and Queen are dead..."</p>
<p>He paused for a moment.</p>
<p>"At least, we <i>assume</i> they&#039;re dead..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Well, they didn&#039;t die so much as...vanish, did they. It&#039;s possible<br />
they&#039;re out there, but what are the odds the Black Roses got their<br />
hands on them, or a legitimate heir? And if they somehow had, why would<br />
they use this tactic when just presenting the monarchs or a royal heir<br />
would get all of Faerie behind them?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"True.  So what you&#039;re saying is, they could have someone in mind<br />
that no-one would object to, but that the Houses wouldn&#039;t immediately<br />
jump at the chance of having on the throne?  That could be their<br />
plan - it doesn&#039;t sound like a strong monarch, but it might be one who<br />
acts merely as a puppet for the Committee.   The only problem<br />
is, I just can&#039;t think of anyone that it could be..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Nor can I," Akane nodded. "So we&#039;re going to have to find out from<br />
them. I suppose that means at least playing along long enough to figure<br />
out what&#039;s going on. The Chrysanthemum Prince thinks I&#039;m sympathetic to<br />
the Committee&#039;s cause, but it didn&#039;t seem like he has enough pull there<br />
to get me any information beyond that. Ilandra&#039;s out, as they&#039;d<br />
pressure her to shut down the hospital to prove her loyalty... But<br />
yeah, somebody (or multiple somebodies) need to infiltrate the<br />
Committee and find out what the ace up their sleeve is," Akane said.</p>
<p>She tugged at her hat and sighed. <i>I decide the job&#039;s gotten<br />
both too boring and too brutal, I shut down the office and decide to go<br />
take a nice family vacation, and what do I get? I come back to Faerie<br />
and find it ass-deep in intrigue. I can&#039;t turn away from a good<br />
mystery, I really can&#039;t, but I had really hoped for a holiday....</i></p>

<p>"Somebody, eh?  I wonder, how friendly are you with that Chrysanthemum guy?"</p>
<p>Abel was silent for a while, his face taking on more of a frown with every passing second.</p>
<p>"You&#039;re talking about House Poppy, aren&#039;t you?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra let out a laugh, "Abel, you&#039;re so silly sometimes... of course<br />
she means house poppy. Our house is only two people." she said,<br />
mirthfully. "Anyways, all this politicking is great, but we ought to<br />
get back to the party before people start worrying about us."</p>
<p>She sat back up from her position lying down on Cain&#039;s lap so he could play with her hair.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I can&#039;t see how it&#039;s a bad idea getting a Poppy man or two behind the committee doors." she said, non-commitally.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Oh, I&#039;m <i>veeery</i><br />
friendly with Theodore dearest, and have been ever since Ilandra<br />
pointed to some random person at the feast tonight and told me to <i>pump his ass for information</i>!" Akane growled.</p>
<p>"That&#039;s the kind of investigation I&#039;m talking about - a small-scale<br />
operation that doesn&#039;t commit Poppy or Honeysuckle resources to Black<br />
Rose control. Ilandra is out as Duchess Honeysuckle, Cain is out as<br />
soon-to-be Duke - I would not advise you to risk your people anymore<br />
than I&#039;d advise Ilandra to risk ours! No, I wasn&#039;t talking about House<br />
Poppy, I was talking about you and me.</p>
<p>"We are not the heads of our respective houses, but we are heirs. We<br />
are unlikely to come to power anytime soon - and with any luck, <i>I</i><br />
never will at all - but it can be assumed that we might influence our<br />
liege&#039;s decisions. They would have a reason to feed us information, and<br />
we&#039;d have an excuse not to commit our respective Houses to their cause."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, I&#039;m sure our mission would be successful, provided we&#039;re never required to stop arguing in the name of stealth.</p>
<p>Still, with any luck things will stay verbal, and we&#039;ll have more luck<br />
getting information out of her than your friend with the shiny teeth<br />
did.  It&#039;s never going to work with Regara present, though, so<br />
we&#039;re going to at least have to wait until she&#039;s finished discussing<br />
whatever it is."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"You want to approach her now as soon as she finishes talking with your<br />
mother, right after we stomped in there fairly directly implying that<br />
we thought the Black Rose had kidnapped the Duchess? Are you sure<br />
that&#039;s optimal timing?" she raised an eyebrow. "I&#039;m just glad you and I<br />
didn&#039;t make it out of the corridor, at least we have our credibility."</p>
<p>And, more quietly, and perhaps with a little anger: "If we&#039;re going to<br />
work together on this, Abel, we&#039;re going to have to clear up one thing.<br />
You&#039;ve known me most of my life. What the hell made you think I was<br />
callous enough to suggest we use your entire House as bait?</p>
<p>"You may&#039;ve missed this bit, but if you know what a Devil&#039;s Advocaat<br />
is, then you know what it means when somebody&#039;s running around looking<br />
like an escapee from a film noire. I&#039;m a professional PI. When I put<br />
together an investigation team, I make damn sure that if I share in the<br />
responsibility for the decisions, I also share in the risks."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I wouldn&#039;t have described it as callous.  We&#039;re a House that&#039;s<br />
lost pretty much everything; of all the Houses we&#039;d have the most to<br />
gain from siding with the Black Roses if they were sincere, and they<br />
realise that.  I&#039;m sure even Regara realises it too.  In<br />
fact, for all we know, Regara could be doing what we plan to do right<br />
at this moment.</p>
<p>"But even if she&#039;s not, other influential Poppies being keen might lure<br />
her into divulging information.  We&#039;ve heard plenty of stories of<br />
Houses <i>considering</i><br />
taking the Black Roses up on their offer, but none yet that we know<br />
have actually done so.  Poppy might be the first, and they might<br />
be prepared to give away a lot of information to get a first confirmed<br />
ally."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Well, that&#039;s good reasoning on all counts," Akane nodded. <i>Gods, I&#039;m fairly sure I didn&#039;t use to get into <b>this</b> many arguments with people before I vanished, unless they caught me and Ilandra at some prank...</i></p>
<p>"I&#039;m just worried that if we find out the Committee <i>is</i><br />
involved in something nasty, we&#039;ll be &#039;in too deep&#039; to extricate<br />
ourselves. Espionage can be a hard thing, especially given most of your<br />
people won&#039;t know that we&#039;re not taking the Black Roses at face value.</p>
<p>"You&#039;re not a house that&#039;s lost everything, Prince Abel - you still<br />
have your people, and now your lands. Not even we Honeysuckles have<br />
lost everything, though we&#039;re a damn sight closer than you are. To<br />
quote what I was told upon coming home...&#039;Well, you and I are here,<br />
Ilandra&#039;s with the Poppies, the Healers are in the hospital and...well,<br />
that&#039;s everyone&#039;. I wouldn&#039;t wish that on anybody.</p>
<p>"One thing to worry about if you join the Committee, or even pretend<br />
to, would be the Red Roses&#039; reaction; but if the Black Roses find us<br />
out, their reaction will probably make any Red Rose retaliation pale in<br />
comparison.</p>
<p>"Whatever we do, we have to do it carefully..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Perhaps we would be in too deep to extricate ourselves, but maybe<br />
that&#039;s not such a bad thing - after all, if they need to be taken down,<br />
it&#039;s much easier with someone on the inside.  But I agree, we must<br />
be very cautious.  Presumably our endeavour must begin with<br />
talking to Elaine, which for now is impossible.  When do you think<br />
would be the best time?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra jumped up and started bouncing. "I wanna be a spy too!!!" she<br />
cried out, excitedly. "Please? I can be stealthy!!! But I&#039;d need<br />
someone else on a horse if I have to go anywhere on horseback, cos<br />
those things are huge and my feet are tiny and they might crush me..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Ahhh...Ilandra...umm..." Akane wildly searched for a way to explain<br />
things that wouldn&#039;t be offensive. Ilandra was not in the least stupid,<br />
but she sometimes didn&#039;t bother with subtlety... She looked helplessly<br />
at Cain and Abel.</p>
<p>"Basically, what spying involves is asking the right kinds of questions to get them to tell you things you want to know, <i>without</i><br />
having them figure out that you haven&#039;t been entirely honest with them.<br />
The thing is, you&#039;re a Duchess, which means it won&#039;t be so easy for you<br />
to keep a low profile, and the most important thing about spying is to<br />
be discreet...which means, not getting doused with water in the middle<br />
of a feast. If you like, though, when we have some time, we can pretend<br />
I&#039;m someone you&#039;re trying to pry information from, and see how you do.</p>
<p>"As for the best time to speak to Elaine...if she turns up here again,<br />
then the answer to that is easy. If not, then we&#039;ll need to arrange<br />
some kind of meeting, declare our interest in her proposal, and see<br />
where that gets us..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra perked up at the promise of practice.</p>
<p>"I&#039;ll see if i can find an old hair brush with no bristles... but I&#039;d<br />
much rather you didn&#039;t put sticks anywhere near my dress." she said,<br />
not noticing Cain going bright red next to her.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Ilandra...umm...you&#039;re not going to need a hairbrush for this, unless<br />
you want to keep the bristles in and brush her hair." Akane noticed<br />
Cain&#039;s growing embarassment. "Caaain...where did she hear about the<br />
hairbrush thing? Or do I not want to know?" She sighed. "It looks like<br />
we&#039;re going to have to start from the beginning... Our opsec is sooo<br />
screwed."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Erk!" Cain exclaimed, gulping guiltily.  "Erm, I mean, er...  I think Ilandra really could do with your tuition..."</p>
<p>Cain leaned over and whispered in Akane&#039;s ear.  "She, erm...<br />
She saw something in the human world that gave her the impression that,<br />
er, detectives were somewhat, er...  That is, that their<br />
activities are generally somewhat, um, pornographic..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"What...? Oh. Oh, dear," Akane started laughing. "It could&#039;ve been<br />
worse - she could&#039;ve wound up seeing porn with nurses instead. I don&#039;t<br />
know what the Healers and the patients would&#039;ve thought of <i>that</i>... There is going to be a reckoning, though! <i>Where did Ilandra find porn?</i>" she groaned.</p>
<p>"Ilandra, you&#039;re really, really not going to need the hairbrush. And<br />
you get to keep your clothes on. Investigation work really isn&#039;t much<br />
like that movie you saw - mostly, you ask a lot of questions, and if<br />
you&#039;re lucky, you get a lot of answers. The important thing is knowing<br />
what to ask and how to ask it. As a general rule of thumb, one of the<br />
questions you <i>don&#039;t</i> ask is, &#039;have you been a bad boy&#039;.</p>
<p>"Humans have a tendency to make a kind of movie called &#039;porn&#039;, which<br />
basically doesn&#039;t show you how to be a detective, or anything else; the<br />
point of that kind of movie is to show a lot of sex. If you want to<br />
learn, keep in mind you&#039;re not going to be learning anything like what<br />
you saw in the movie..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Akane&#039;s outburst confused Ilandra... to the best of her knowledge there<br />
hadn&#039;t been any prawns and as for sex... well, wasn&#039;t that only allowed<br />
between married people?</p>
<p>"There weren&#039;t any prawns Akane, just pleasewomen and a judge with a<br />
whip and sticks and hairbrushes with no bristles!" Ilandra protested.<br />
"And the weird guy that was watching the film did ask me if I wanted to<br />
have some fun... but then got drunk and fell asleep. So I wandered off<br />
cos the film was getting weird. Anyway, Lysander said that those films<br />
were documentaries. And he said a documentary shows you what hummums do<br />
in situations so that other hummums can learn stuff too... he also<br />
showed me books that the hummums wrote, they were quite weird... they<br />
had "cars" in them."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Yes, humans do have cars, but we&#039;ll leave explaining cars for another day..." <i>Nothing<br />
wrong with a good car. Heh...I think I may have gone a bit native<br />
during my time away, given makeup makes more sense to me than glamour<br />
and cars more normal than horses...</i></p>
<p>"There aren&#039;t any pleasewomen, judges don&#039;t carry whips or sticks and<br />
people tend to leave the bristles on their hairbrushes. Those films<br />
really aren&#039;t documentaries - they don&#039;t show what humans actually do<br />
with their time, just how some humans wish things did work. Humans have<br />
these odd notions about sex, given how much time they spend either<br />
thinking about it, or trying not to. I can assure you that many humans<br />
don&#039;t wait till they&#039;re married to have sex," <i>And frankly that makes a lot of sense to me,</i> she added mentally, "And that the movie you saw has to do with sex.</p>
<p>"If you still want to learn even though it&#039;s not like that movie, we&#039;ll<br />
go over the basics at some point, alright?" She said, helplessly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked quite upset at her cousin&#039;s declaration.</p>
<p>"There are pleasewomen, and pleasemen... they have truncheons and cool<br />
hats with checkered bits on them..." she sniffled at her cousin. "I<br />
know this cos one of them helped me find my way to where the pigeons<br />
were so I could meet back up with Lysander."</p>
<p>She started crying, "and Lysander thanked the pleaseman, and then when<br />
we got home he made sure our parents didn&#039;t tell me off cos I wasn&#039;t<br />
supposed to have wandered off."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane shifted guiltily and hugged her cousin. <i>Oh, crap. That&#039;s what she meant. I thought it was just one more kink in those weird porn movies...</i><br />
"Those are called policewomen and policemen, honey, and they do exist,<br />
but I didn&#039;t understand because of what you were calling them. The job<br />
of the police is to make sure people don&#039;t break the human laws, and to<br />
catch them if they do. The kind of detectiving we&#039;ll be doing may be a<br />
bit different from that, though, because Faerie doesn&#039;t work quite like<br />
the human world. What we&#039;re going to be trying to do is to get<br />
information about the Black Rose people, their movements, their plans,<br />
and so forth. I&#039;m sure that if you and I have a chat and a few lessons,<br />
you&#039;ll make a great detective, really!" she cajoled Ilandra.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Visibly perking up, Ilandra freed herself from her cousin&#039;s hug.</p>
<p>"Let&#039;s go back to the party or someone will be sent to find us and<br />
they&#039;ll get suspicious of us if we&#039;re all in Cain&#039;s room." she said.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Yeah," Akane smirked. "We conspirators four. Vive la revolution..."<br />
she sighed, and resolved to get very drunk - anything to keep from<br />
thinking about the enormity of the undertaking. Oh, and the fact that<br />
everybody was dead. On her way to the door she eyed Abel. <i>He&#039;s<br />
probably realised how difficult this is going to be as well...plus,<br />
getting wasted in company tends to have some bonding effect. It&#039;s<br />
looking like we&#039;re in charge here, and we can&#039;t afford to be squabbling<br />
instead of working together....</i></p>
<p>"Oy, Abel. I&#039;m planning to get very drunk and try not to think about<br />
the fact that the four of us are going to try to save Faerie from the<br />
Committee. Wanna join in?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Now that," said Abel, "is one plan of yours I&#039;m never going to<br />
disagree with.  Cain?  Ilandra?  Will you be<br />
accompanying us, or are you going to be staying here?"  Abel<br />
grinned conspiratorially at Cain, who blushed and shook his head.</p>
<p>"No," he said.  "We&#039;re coming."</p>
<p>Abel stood up, and glared at Cain until he followed his brother out of the room.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Seeing that they were alone, Akane grinned at Ilandra. "You know, you two <i>are</i><br />
going to be married. You both need to work suggesting you take things<br />
any farther than you&#039;re okay comfortable , but hey...I guarantee you if<br />
you drag the boy somewhere private and kiss the hell out of him, he<br />
really won&#039;t be complaining."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra turned bright crimson. "I always wanted to, but what if he runs<br />
away like he did earlier? You&#039;re right perhaps I do need to take a<br />
chance, but I&#039;m scared, I don&#039;t really know what to do or say. How do<br />
you know so much anyway?" she said, embarrassment tinging her voice.</p>
<p>A thought dawned on Ilandra.</p>
<p>"Akane, have you...?" she said, shocked to the very core that her cousin would suggest stuff.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane shrugged. "Does it matter if I have? When I left I was a minor<br />
daughter of a noble house, not particularly useful for anything,<br />
including being bartered off in a marriage alliance. I certainly never<br />
expected to come back and find myself &#039;Princess Akane of House<br />
Honeysuckle&#039;, even if I did have the bloodline for it. Even now, I&#039;m<br />
only Princess because you have no other heirs yet, and because you<br />
think it&#039;s cool to give me the title. And outside of Faerie, nobody<br />
really cared who &#039;Rowane Reynard, Private Investigator&#039; did or did not<br />
sleep with as long as she got the job done." <i>Or<br />
maybe what happened is that, as humans&#039; attitudes towards sex changed<br />
in that last century, so did mine. I lived through the social<br />
revolution.</i></p>
<p>"I didn&#039;t tell you to sleep with him, though - not unless that&#039;s what<br />
you want. It&#039;s always embarassing at first, but the embarassment fades<br />
with time. You don&#039;t have to <i>say</i> anything, just kiss him. He&#039;s your fiancee; even in Faerie, I doubt anyone else would fault you for that."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra was fascinated.</p>
<p>"I think maybe I need to have a drink or two before I start... I heard<br />
it makes people &#039;loosen up&#039;..." Ilandra said, still blushing. "C&#039;mon,<br />
last one to the guys is a rotten egg!" having said that she jumped up<br />
and ran out of the room, skidding dangerously as she did so.</p>
<p>As she approached Cain, she tried to slow down and stop running but<br />
hadn&#039;t factored in the sheer slipperiness of the floors and crashed<br />
straight into his back... arms at about waist level, grabbing him to<br />
steady herself. She went bright red again and rapidly moved her hands<br />
up, hoping he hadn&#039;t noticed.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain stopped, stunned.  Abel turned to grin at his brother, fully<br />
aware of what just happened, but Cain refused to meet his gaze.</p>
<p>Seconds passed.</p>
<p>And minutes.</p>
<p>"Um... Ilandra?" Cain whipsered.  "Ilandra?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane had made it into the hallway in time to see Ilandra crash into<br />
Cain, in an accident so masterful she couldn&#039;t have done it better if<br />
she&#039;d orchestrated it. As she passed them in the hall, she winked at<br />
Ilandra encouragingly and left the two of them to sort it out. <i>I&#039;ve<br />
said my piece; anything more, and it&#039;d qualify as pressure. Whatever<br />
they do, it should be because they want to, just as whatever they don&#039;t<br />
do, it shouldn&#039;t be because they were too shy to try...</i></p>
<p>She walked up to Abel. "I think we&#039;d best leave them to be embarassed<br />
at each other. They may hate us for a bit, but hopefully they&#039;ll figure<br />
it out a lot sooner than if we were there. Ahh, young love, so cute,"<br />
she added in a whisper.</p>
<p><i>((OOC: I can&#039;t be arsed making that last sentence a "private to". So sue me!))</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Abel nodded, turned and winked at Cain just in case he was looking, then followed Akane back to the banquet.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Vaguely aware that Akane had walked off, Ilandra managed to squeak<br />
"help!" before letting go of Cain. Her face was so red, she was sure<br />
it&#039;d glow in the dark or burn holes in objects.</p>
<p>She had hoped to be able to make some sort of recovery, but her body<br />
seemed to be made of stone. With a loud thump she hit the floor, where<br />
her hands twitched slightly. She was also vaguely aware of some<br />
dampness where her nose should be.</p>
<p><i>dear god, what have I done? He&#039;s gonna run off now and I&#039;m gonna have to scour the castle to find him and I can&#039;t move.</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain turned, and looked down at the quivering heap of Ilandra on the<br />
floor.  His blush cleared from his face, and he smiled weakly.</p>
<p>Then, he picked up Ilandra as gingerly as he could, carried her back to<br />
is room and laid her on the bed whilst he went off to dampen a cloth to<br />
deal with her nosebleed.</p>
<p>In the bathroom, he sat for a minute with the damp cloth on his head,<br />
letting the chill of it wash away his embarassment, before wetting it<br />
again and returning to Ilandra.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>As her vision focused, she realised Cain was washing the blood off her face. She hadn&#039;t realised she&#039;d get a nosebleed.</p>
<p><i>Akane said to kiss the hell out of him... maybe I should take her advice. How do I know when the hell is kissed out</i><br />
she wiped her mouth with the edge of his cuff and when he returned<br />
again with a clean cloth, grabbed him and clumsily kissed him.</p>
<p><i>hey, this isn&#039;t as hard as I thought it would be...</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain, utterly caught by surprised, stiffened for a second (and no, ye<br />
of dirty mind, not like that), but then relaxed.  He returned her<br />
kiss - slowly, ineptly, but with emotion.</p>
<p>When their lips parted, Cain looked Ilandra in the eyes and said...</p>
<p>"Um...  I, er...  Would you excuse me for a moment?"</p>
<p>So saying, he left the room in a hurry before Ilandra could calculate the extend of the blush that now graced his features.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Slightly confused, Ilandra sat up on the bed.</p>
<p><i>I don&#039;t understand... he ran off anyway... maybe he doesn&#039;t like<br />
being kissed. Or maybe I did it wrong... I wish I could ask Akane.</i></p>
<p>She was about to get up and go loking for Akane when Cain ran back into the room, bottle of wine in hand. Ilandra smiled weakly.</p>
<p><i>is he trying to get me drunk? or is he as nervous as I am? I feel<br />
all funny now... maybe if I pounced him like Akane said... I&#039;m sure<br />
instincts will take over.</i></p>
<p>But all she could work herself up to doing was snatching the bottle of<br />
wine from him, raising an eyebrow and drinking a mouthful. She hiccuped<br />
a little, already extremely tipsy. (Ilandra had not had wine before...<br />
at least not the undiluted stuff...)</p>
<p>She pulled Cain to her with her free hand and giggled, then kissed him again, spilling the wine.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p><i>Nope,</i> Cain thought as Ilandra released him from the kiss, <i>it&#039;s still happening.</i></p>
<p>He poured what remained of the bottle down his throat, and collapsed backwards onto his bed.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra panicked a little, made sure the door was closed and pulled the curtains of the four-post bed around them.</p>
<p><i>I think I&#039;m gonna be sick... I&#039;m so scared</i></p>
<p>She and Cain carried on kissing for a while, taking each other&#039;s clothes off in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p><font color="red">I&#039;m not posting details of the next bit... If you<br />
don&#039;t know what people who are in love do together then I strongly<br />
recommend you look it up on google</font></p>
<p>After a while, everything seemed to be returning to normal.</p>
<p><i>so that&#039;s what it feels like... wow!</i> Ilandra smiled at Cain, and kissed him again. She felt surprisingly less nervous, though that might be cos she was drunk.</p>
<p>Nervously, she started putting the clothes he&#039;d lent her back on.</p>
<p>"I... erm... I&#039;ve never done that before, I hope it was good for you."<br />
she said, blushing. "I enjoyed it, but I hope you don&#039;t mind that I<br />
need a drink now, just to steady my nerves." having said that she<br />
walked out of the room and along the hall into the main hall.</p>
