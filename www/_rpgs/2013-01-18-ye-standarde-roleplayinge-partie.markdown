Did the Munchkin RPG ever need pre-gen characters? No? Ah well, I made some anyway.

<br/><strong>Steve the Mighty</strong>
Race/Class: Human Barbarian
Alignment: Neutral Impulsive
Steve the Mighty's favourite sound is the despair of his enemies, and his favourite food is strawberry millefeuille.

<br/><strong>Curunír i goll</strong>
Race/Class: Elven Wizard
Alignment: Lawful Weary
Curunír didn't study for centuries under the finest magicians of the Western Isles just to have to put up with your shit now.

<br/><strong>Narin the Irritating</strong>
Race/Class: Dwarven Bard
Alignment: Petulant Good
Narin was exiled from his mountain home after the elders tired of hearing about how his music was inspired by the dark emptiness of his soul.

<br/><strong>Bobbin Brandybutter</strong>
Race/Class: Halfling Rogue
Alignment: Familial Neutral
The Brandybutter family have eyes and ears everywhere. You cross them at your peril.

<br/><strong>Kallista Korol</strong>
Race/Class: Tiefling Sorcerer
Alignment: Psychotic Evil
No matter how great your need to smoke, do not ask Kallista if she has a lighter. They will still be discovering bits of your charred remains a week later.

<br/><strong>Thrag the Questionable</strong>
Race/Class: Troll Ranger
Alignment: Meek Good
At the age of 12, trolls are sent into the wilderness and expected to hunt and kill to survive. Thrag returned that afternoon with a delightfully arranged bunch of carnations.
