Run time: 1hr<br/><br/>

Starts from the soldier's suicide in the inn.
Everyone fairly dumbstruck, hopefully the PCs take charge
<ul>
	<li>If so, sort the villagers out for a bit; people come to expect them to go and find out what happened to the soldiers</li>
	<li>If not, introduce an NPC (Hendrick) who intends to do the job; rope PCs in.
Say fond farewells, set off into the forest.</li>
</ul>
Explore characters' motivations if not previously covered in the village.

&nbsp;

Human tracks thin, animal tracks predominate. Ranger can find the soldiers' tracks with Survival at DC10. (Yeah so I forgot Wilderness Lore existed)

Druid can sense tracking wolves at Survival DC20, then DC15, If he fails both the party are ambushed, otherwise the druid can alert the party and everyone can make spot checks at DC15. Â Druid Animal Trance / Dominate Animal?

&nbsp;
<h4>Battle vs Wolf x2</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Wolves nervous of Dan</li>
</ul>
Continue trek, camp for night. Keep watch?
<ul>
	<li>If so, describe creepy noises / flickers etc</li>
	<li>If not, woken up by something snuffling, but it flees.</li>
</ul>
End.
