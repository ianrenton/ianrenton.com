<h4>Notes for Dan</h4>
Your character's Knowledge: Geography allows you to know what's on this map.  The area shown is about 100-150 miles square, and you know that it's a tiny fraction of the size of the world.  You haven't necessarily <em>been</em> to any of the places shown, but you know where they are.  There are probably also hundreds of other villages in the area, but you don't know their names.

The other characters do not know what yours knows, geography-wise.  He can tell them as much or as little as you like, depending on how you want to play it -- he may tell them nothing of the outside world, or he may reproduce this map in character on day one, or anything inbetween.  He may even lie to the other characters if appropriate.  (He is Chaotic Good, which suggests that he is probably happy to lie to someone if it's in their best interests.)
