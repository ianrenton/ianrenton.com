<p>Forgotten Children is a novel-length work of fiction that I intended to serialise online to give myself an impetus to write something longer than a short story.  Needless to say it failed, and I only wrote an introduction and five chapters.  You can find them below.</p>
<p>It is a story of humanity a thousand years from now, a humanity that has mastered genetic and neurological engineering and strung orbital cities across the solar system.  Then, with recent advances in engine and communication technology, our species began its first interstellar colonisation.  Three ships, each as big as cities, were sent out into the great void beyond the solar system.</p>
<p>Shinsei, a young man just beginning his career on one of those ships, and Jenny, whose past is catching up with her back in our solar system, are about to discover that their lives and goals are inextricably entwined.</p>
