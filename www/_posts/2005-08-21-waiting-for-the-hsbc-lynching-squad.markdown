So, currently...  I'm on my overdraft limit, I owe my parents £40 and there's already £60 on my credit card.  I have two weeks, including - hopefully - a trip to Southampton, in which I can spend precisely nothing.  Not a very fun situation to be in.  My wallet contains twenty-four pence, not even enough to buy breakfast a work...  

In other news - at least this is free - <a href="http://www.marmablue.co.uk/index.php?title=Flashbacks_(Childhood_Memories_Project)">Flashbacks</a> is coming along pretty well.  In fact, I may have nearly finished, although I'll continue adding things to it occasionally as I remember them.  I took a walk around some of the places I remembered today, taking photos which thanks to my delightful 'net connection are currently confined to my hard disk.  Still, I'll try to get them uploaded, even if I can only do one a day or so.  

I haven't added photos to the Flashbacks page itself yet, but some of the photos have made it to my DevArt:

<a href="http://www.deviantart.com/view/22090101/">Forgotten Divide</a>  

While out there today, I also discovered a little more about which memories of my past are real and which were only dreams.  Details to appear on <a href="http://www.marmablue.co.uk/index.php?title=Flashbacks_(Childhood_Memories_Project)#Bronze_Lake">Flashbacks: Bronze Lake</a> tomorrow night.
