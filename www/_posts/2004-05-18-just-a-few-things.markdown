Yesterday, (while everyone was being <a href="http://www.konami.co.jp/am/bm2dx/">IIDX</a>-obsessed) I think I pretty much decided that I will, after all, cosplay as <a href="http://www.konami.co.jp/am/bm2dx/bm2dx7/images/g2arts_goli_shem.jpg">Shem</a> at <a href="http://www.minamicon.org.uk/">Minamicon</a>.  It'll feel odd, cosplaying as someone who looks extremely evil ^_^;  

Today, the weather here's awesome so I spent some time sunbathing.  I'm at Uni working all this afternoon, firstly to get some work done and secondly to avoid the attentions of Flat 9, who are intent on getting me to go to Jesters tonight, which I have no intention of doing.  Also, due to meteorological awesomeness, we might be playing Exalted outside tonight! \o/
