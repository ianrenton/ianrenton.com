I woke up after having a fairly odd dream, but was wide awake from the moment I got up.  Easily made it to the lecture on time. Then, I started to get irritated by everything, I don't know why.  Itchy seats, people whispering, the lecturer taking about five minutes expalining what convection was when we've blatantly know what it was for at least five years... that kinda' thing.  

But on the way home, I kind of changed... I spent the journey listening to calm songs and J-Pop rather than the metal and techno that usually gets played, and the sunshine was really nice...  Now I think I realise... once the summer comes again, everything will be okay, and happy again... I think.  And for now, I have the urge to dance.  Just... dance, until I physically can't anymore.  I don't know why...
