Inamongst the hectic schedule of revision and post-exam events, there's something I'd entirely forgotten about until now.  

In less than a day's time, I will have finished university.  

My last exam is tomorrow afternoon, finishing at 4.30pm.  Besides my eventual graduation ceremony, that's it.  

Three years?  How on Earth did it get to three years?  It barely feels like three weeks...
