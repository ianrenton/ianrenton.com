So, yesterday we had dinner at this place, which delights in the horrible name of "Georgie Porgie's Buffet World".

Delighting in horror does not stop at the name.  It is this place's _ethos_, its _mission statement_.  It is an all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant that knows not the boundaries of culture, of taste, of cuisine, or of [web design](http://www.georgieporgiesbuffet.com/). (WARNING: Steaming steak flashblob ahead.)

[This is its menu](http://www.georgieporgiesbuffet.com/buffetmenu.html).  To fully experience the wonder, you are naturally expected to eat all of this, and holy shit did I try.  You get no photos, because I'm not "post-ironic" and I'm fairly sure an instagram must be something like a strip-o-gram.  But rest assured, onion rings and onion bhaji is an epic combination.  As is piri-piri chicken and spring rolls.  Also cajun chicken, crispy seaweed and mango chutney.

What amused me most was that the diners were just as culturally diverse as the food, including many from the countries whose food was being attempted.  It just goes to show, no matter where in the world you're from, no matter what your culture, no-one can quite match Britain's ability to merrily take those diverse global cultures and fuck them in the eyesocket with a fork.
