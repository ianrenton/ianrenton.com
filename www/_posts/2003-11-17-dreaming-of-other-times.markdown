Dreaming of other times...<br/>
Other worlds, perhaps...<br/>
My eyes open, my ears listening,<br/>
but my mind gone...<br/>
Journeying forever amongst the stars,<br/>
in other places and other times,<br/>
while my body stays unmoving.

What are these things we call dreams?<br/>
Our bodies are light and warm,<br/>
but our minds are outside, in the darkness and the snow...<br/>
Dreaming...<br/>
Only dreaming...

One with the World,<br/>
One with the Snow...<br/>
Forever and ever.

In other times,<br/>
In other worlds...

*"Deep in this world we are one<br/>
Deep in this world we can be...<br/>
...<br/>
Watching the wings of time<br/>
Knowing that we're alive<br/>
And free..."*<br/>
&mdash; "Love Will Always Light the Way", from Haibane Renmei
