Copying all the quotes from the now-defunct MMWP site into the new quotes system is *actually* more annoying than death itself.  It's going *really* slowly, too...  

Oh yes, I should probably explain...  

After nearly six years, the Mad Marmablue Web Portal has been abandoned. It never really became popular, and in the end, a site so general with so few users was never going to be worthwhile. After a month of updating the news articles every day, whilst seeing no sign of any other users on the site, I decided to pull the plug. Many thanks to those of you who have taken part over the years.  

Onwards and Upwards as they say, and all is not lost. I'll be devoting more of my time to the new website for Dreaming Awake, my book/game project. The Quotes Archive and Photo Galleries, the only two popular areas of the MMWP, are still in existance, and in fact the Photo Gallery section is now much shinier than before. The quotes continue to remain wiki-based, so anyone can add to them.  

So yeah.  The end of an era, I suppose... but then, every day is the end of an era these days.  And looking back on all the quotes from months past...  So many memories...  Memories that we don't have these days, being so far apart...  But hopefully, next weekend... Minamicon will become another one of those memories.  We'll all start enjoying ourselves again, and the flow of time will take us all onwards...  

Mixed emotions... a beginning and an end...
