Ah... good day, good day.  

The sunlight sleepiness of the morning, the fun of the afternoon, and a peaceful evening too, with the coloured lights of the town shining like a double constellation, on land and reflected in the sea...  

I thought about carrying my camera around today, but then I thought that wouldn't capture all of the essence of it anyway. And besides, in the never-ending future, there'll be a thousand and more wonderful days like these...  

*"Wave after wave rolls on, and the water falls, and the line is drawn.<br/>
Wave after wave rolls in, and the line is gone where my feet have been.<br/>
Hills that I know are there, hidden from my view by the misty air.<br/>
Light shining through the grey turns the water deep shades of lilac blue.<br/>
Music in every sound, light beyond each cloud, hope in every dream.<br/>
Songs like a healing breeze, every breath inhale and the goodness feel.<br/>
Lanes that have brought me here, framed in season flowers, lined in summer green..."*<br/>
&mdash; Iona, "Wave After Wave"
