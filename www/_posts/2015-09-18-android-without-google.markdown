For several years, I've been [considering](/blog/could-i-live-without/) whether I could&mdash;and should&mdash;dispose of my Google account. Since I wrote the linked post back in 2011, my use of Google services has declined anyway, and I no longer use GMail, Google+ or Google Calendar. At the same time, it has become apparent that users at at the whim of Google's [decision to close unprofitable services](/blog/google-reader-vs-do-no-evil/) (even beloved ones like Reader), and to [force us into using others](http://phandroid.com/2013/11/11/do-you-hate-the-new-google-youtube-comments/) against our will. "Don't Be Evil" is [starting to look hilariously na&iuml;ve](http://gizmodo.com/5878987/its-official-google-is-evil-now).

The last hold-out in my desire to dump Google is my Android phone. Without a Google account and the [closed-source "Google Play Services"](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/) blob that sits at the core of an Android phone, the experience is diminished significantly. While I like my phone's hardware, I am not fond of the Google integration that I no longer fully trust. So, for the last few months I have been experimenting with running *Android without Google*.

Here's what I've learned.

## I do Depend on Some Google Apps after all.

Aside from what's provided in my AOSP-based CyanogenMod base software (much of which was written by Google, but is at least open source), I have two Google apps left on my phone&mdash;Maps and YouTube.

*Maps* features live traffic updates, a key feature when driving long distances to see friends and family. Although other apps have voice guided navigation (I also have [OsmAnd](http://osmand.net/) installed), I've been unable to find a free live traffic offering that matches Google's.

*YouTube* doesn't seem to have a decent open source client for Android, either due to legal problems or just that there's little desire for one. To cope with my son's regular desire to watch the music videos for obscure pop songs on my phone, I've had to keep this installed too.

## That means Google Play Services stays.

Neither Maps nor YouTube works without Google Play Services installed, and so far that's meant I have had to keep it installed on my phone.

However, my main trust issues with Google stem from their tracking and the amount of data they (want to) store about me. I can still prevent this another way&mdash;by removing the Google account from my phone. Play Services, Maps and YouTube continue working correctly, but my phone-based activities are no longer reported to Google in a way that connects them to me, and I can move one step closer to deleting my account.
