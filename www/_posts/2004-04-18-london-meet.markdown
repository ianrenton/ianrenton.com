So much ownage compressed into such a short period of time.  Today really was absolutely awesome.  <a href="http://photos.ianrenton.com/?album=RERSRlVLIEJvdXJuZW1vdXRoIE1lZXQsIEFwcmlsIDIwMDQ=" target="_blank">Pictures here.</a>  Umm... yeah ^_^;  I really can't think of a way in which today could have actually been better.  A really awesome end to an awesome Easter holiday.  

In faggy-dance-game news, not only did I finally pass Vook (on Normal) today, I A'ed it... then went on to S two Hard mode songs.  Ant's probably right in saying that I'm better at Pump than DDR now...  (Also, Exceed is purest Less Than Three in computerised form.)
