Today has been a very odd day...  

It started all normal and Friday-like, expect that I forgot to set my alarm so I didn't make it in in time for my maths lecture...  I made it for the end though so I could hand in this week's problem sheets and get my soursework mark back - a disappointing 62%.  James and I left Electronics labs early, and went for a few pints and plates of chips in the Stile (the pub next to the campus) to celebrate the end of term.  Then I got back to the flat, and my flatmates had cooked an awesomely delicious roast dinner, accompanied by much alcohol, just in case I hadn't had enough already.  

Then things took a turn for the more odd, when we tried to go to the Academy (a club just down the road).  The queue was massive, so we decided not to bother... but Vicky and Jo queue-jumped with some guys they knew.  The rest of us stood outside in the rain for 15 minutes or so, whilst Vicky and Jo decided whether to stay there or not.  After we all decided to leave, we went to Bedfords' for a quick drink then on to Yates's, which was actually really fun!  It really picked us up from the depressed mood we were in before.  

Once we left there, emotional turmoil broke out in our flat...  A guy showed up (first impression: he's a twat) and seemed to cause Vicky and Jo to start arguing with each other, and all sorts of overly-emotional things happening all night.  I think most people are too complicated...  I try to be honest all the time, and the "me" people know really *is* the real me - there's not a lot deeper you can really go.  But a lot of people, especially spurred on by alcohol, aren't like that, I guess...  

Anyway~su, this is now officially m first 12-hour stright drinking session!  I started at 4.30pm,  and it's now after 4.30am and I'm still drinking!  

Oh, and I have to be up by early afternoon to meet my dad, who's bringing me and all my junk back from Uni for the holidays...  I guess I should probably be sober and not hung over when he arrives...
