I´m off work today, since I´m now on my third day of headaches and rest-of-my-body aches as well.  Paracetamol doesn't seem to work very well, whilst Ibuprofen does, which is kind of odd.  Still, since the latter did work, I'm now in that really odd-feeling position of being off work whilst not feeling all that ill.  

Still, hopefully it means that I'll be well enough to go back to work tomorrow...
