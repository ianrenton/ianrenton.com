The Bournemouth Meet is only two days away!  This is my final warning to anyone who wants to come and hasn't signed up yet!  

The organisation thread is <a href="http://tsuki-chama.livejournal.com/152476.html">here</a>.  It's been updated with maps for those who haven't come here before.  

If you're not yet signed up and want to, please post in that thread.  

And finally, <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/uk/sw/bournemouth_forecast_weather.html">the forecast is icky</a>, but if we <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/6901543.stm">get rid of all the neo-pagans</a> we stand a chance.  Get burninating!
