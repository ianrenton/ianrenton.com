There's something oddly wonderful about tearing the flesh from the bones of Aeris and Tidus with a blunt knife to the background music of Manowar, before tossing the bits in boiling oil and then stewing them for two hours.  

I should probably explain, Aeris and Tidus are rabbits.  

There are pics, including one of Mark looking <strike>very</strike> <i>EDIT: "moderately"</i> gay with them, but to save myself from being lynched by every vegetarian on my friends list I'll avoid posting them =p
