Over the weekend, my friend [Alex](http://haku.me) visited us and brought his quadcopter in tow. I've bee [trying my best](http://blog.ianrenton.com/chromecopter-2000/) to dump ideas on the internet and avoid buying my own extremely expensive remote control toys, but I can see the day I give in getting closer.

Here's my flight over Bournemouth beach, flown as cautiously as you might expect given that I had Â£500 of someone else's money in the air!
