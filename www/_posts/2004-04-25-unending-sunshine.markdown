Yet another perfect day...  

In the afternoon I went into town, changed one of the cables I bought yesterday for one which hopefully fits.  While there, I gave Normal 2 a go on the DDR machine, but failed horribly on CSFILSM, but Tau said that even he nearly failed that the first time he played the course, so I guess I'm not alone ^_^  

After that, half of my flat and half of another went up to the Common and had a barbecue, which was absolutely brilliant (although by the time we'd got going it was dark, which made it a bit tricky!  

Tomorrow, we're heading back to the common - actually early in the day this time - for a picnic o_O  Very random, but I'm sure it'll be awesome fun!
