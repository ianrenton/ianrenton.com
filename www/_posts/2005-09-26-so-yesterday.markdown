I learnt two important things yesterday.  

Firstly, I learnt how to sew.  Sort of, anyway.  So that's good! ^_^  

Secondly, I learnt that whoever invented the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakama">hakama</a> must have been a person who never, *ever* had to wash one.  Such a pain!  Glad I only have to do this four times a year...  

Also, allegedly, my Legendary Kung Fu name is "Maniacal Slaying Fingers".  I... see.  (<a href="http://www.dragonslist.com/?page=kungfuname">see for yourself</a>).  

Five days to go.
