Today, I tried to get my Light and Matter problem sheet done.  It went pretty well, and I got quite a bit of work done.  Then I took a break for coffee and chocolate, and Mark's family came over, and we watched anime and had take-away delivered and played silly board games and...  all hope of working was lost.  

However, it was an awesome day.  And pirate board games (now purchased for the games society, woot!) are much more fun if you all speak with pirate accents and there are at least three replica guns within reach... =p
