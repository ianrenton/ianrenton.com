Pretty much everyone on my project was out at a meeting today, leaving me with pretty much nothing to do.  So...  I wrote.  I feel a bit guilty for having been paid about Â£50 for my work today, which mostly consisted of about 3000 words of fiction.  Still, beats playing Minesweeper.  

Here's today's cranked out junk:  

<a href="http://www.marmablue.co.uk/index.php?title=The_Golden_Age">The Golden Age</a>, an extremely apocalyptic side-story to the latter stages of Dreaming Awake, and  

<a href="http://www.marmablue.co.uk/index.php?title=Caramel's_Talent">Caramel's Talent</a>, a fragment about Caramel, because I wanted to write something about her and I have semi-permanent writer's block on Serenade of Sunlight.  

Enjoy!  Comments, as ever, appreciated.
