Tomorrow, I will be voting for <a href="http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/Council/Councillors/councillor_info.asp?77">this man</a>.  I am trying hard to pretend that his facial hair has not influenced my vote.  

I am also tempted to vote for <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&num=100&hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&hs=7Gh&q=%22christine+renaut%22+lib+dem+bournemouth&btnG=Search&meta=">the woman who does not exist</a>.
