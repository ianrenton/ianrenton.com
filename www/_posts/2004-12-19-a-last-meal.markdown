Tonight, I ate my last proper meal here for a while - and also the largest I've eaten in over a week.  Man, am I stuffed!  

Earlier on today I tried to venture into Portswood to get Christmas stuff, but for some reason all the card and wrapping paper shops seem to have decided to close.  I know it's Sunday, but come on!  What's wrong with opening from 11 'til 5 at least?  So, it looks like I'll be doing emergency shopping tomorrow...  

*[Mai-Hime Episode 8]<br/><br/>Holy fuck, Miyu is EVIL!  And also has KOS-MOS's R-BLADE.  This makes her cool, and yet, I *really* don't want to end up liking her...*
