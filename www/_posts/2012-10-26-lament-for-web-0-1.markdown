With every passing day, my Facebook feed is spending more and more time informing me that old school friends "like Amazon". (No shit, really?) In the background, it's fiddling our feeds, showing and hiding entries according to what it thinks is relevancy, and also what it thinks is [profit for itself](http://dangerousminds.net/comments/facebook_i_want_my_friends_back). Game spam is constant. On the other side of the fence, Twitter is [trying to force out the third-party clients](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/03/twitter-tells-third-party-devs-to-stop-making-twitter-client-apps/) that made it great, so that it can monetise its users more easily.

Should we be surprised? Feel betrayed? Not at all. Facebook and Twitter are in it to make money, yet we use them for free. It's pretty clear that [if you aren't paying for the product, you _are_ the product.](http://psoug.org/blogs/mike/2010/10/21/if-you-arent-paying-for-the-product-you-are-the-product/) We should only expect free-to-use websites to change in favour of their profits, never in favour of us as users.

But I'm growing tired of it. My use of these sites is intensely personal -- they are my default, or only, way of contacting many of my friends -- but yet this personal process is controlled by a company that is willing and able to affect the process to make money. If it's more profitable to show me "Bob likes Product X" than to show me Bob's deep and meaningful status update, you can bet I'll be shown the "like".

I miss everyone being equal. I miss services that were honestly free. I miss being close to the infrastructure I use to communicate, rather than having it abstracted. I miss Web 1.0.

Hell, I miss Web 0.1.

There was a time, not so very long ago, when IRC was our Twitter. It was just as full of funny links and pithy comments, but it was communication between friends, not 140 character witticisms broadcast into the ether in the constant, vain hope of affirmation delivered by the retweets of strangers.

There was a time when blogs were our Facebook, our innermost thoughts put out there for our friends and no-one else; when our friends would think of something to say and say it, rather than simply dishing out an iota of affirmation with the "like" button.

There was a time when mailing lists were our forums, just simple e-mails back and forth without the need for moderators, or advertising, or CAPTCHAs.

There was a time when USENET was our Reddit, a place to while away hours without karma whores and downvotes.

Those times are never coming back. No friends of mine are willing to leave Facebook and talk to each other on a mailing list. The monetising services of Web 2.0 are simply much _better_, easier to use, nicer to look at, more functional. But they're lagging behind the tools and services of the old internet in other ways. Honesty -- what you put into IRC is what you got out, no server inserted "promoted tweets" into your channel. Thoughtfulness -- we had to _say things_ to each other, no likes, no retweets, no upvotes.

At this point it would be appropriate for me to announce some kind of online ["back to the land" movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-the-land_movement), ending with a rhetorical "who's with me?". But rhetorical it would be, because nobody's with me. I am, at the age of 27, simply old and curmudgeonly before my time; sitting typing in monospaced text to an audience that already sold themselves to play FarmVille.
