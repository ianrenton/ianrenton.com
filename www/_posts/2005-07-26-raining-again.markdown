It just doesn't get any better, does it?  

Half an hour's walk in the cold rain.  

20 minutes stuck at Wareham.  

20 minutes going slowly due to signal problems.  

10 minutes waiting for stuck doors to open at Poole.  

Two armed policemen and one announcement later, we're evacuating the train and the station.  

Half an hour waiting for a bus next to smoking twelve-year-olds.  

An hour's crowded bus ride.  

And a final fifteen minutes walk in the rain, still in just trousers and a shirt.  

Oh, and I'm more broke than an extremely broke thing, too.  

I need more cake.
