I am the master of suckage.  It seems, this year, I'm forgetting everything... I forgot Mothers' Day, my mum's birthday, five family birthdays, and I nearly screwed up Christmas too...  I forgot to get my parents a card, and I managed to leave it until today to get my mum a present.  Unfortunately all the things she actually wanted for Christmas I couldn't find anywhere, so I just bought the nicest-looking box of chocolates I could find...  I hope it's gonna be okay...  Well, I s'pose I'll find out tomorrow morning...  

And, it looks like I'm about to go down the pub with Adam... not sure if my parents thought we'd have a family evening in or not, but...  eh...  

I wonder, am I a lot more stupid than most people?  Not in pure intelligence, I mean, but... do most people forget important things and screw up as much as me...?
