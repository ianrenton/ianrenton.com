w00t!  I am t3h enjoy!  It was great to meet everyone, finally... and yeah, those "dance machine" things were quite good too =p  I've got some pictures, but unfortunately my camera sucks.  I guess other peoples' pics will be appearing on the <a href="http://www.ddrfreak.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=29">DDRFUK Boards</a> soon enough!  

Also, an apology is due to Frieza, who had not t3h fun for some of the time, especially a two hour train journey on his own because the rest of the Bournemouth people stayed later.  Sorry...
