Tonight, I will be mostly eating...  Instant ramen.  </jesse>  I put this down to, uh, post-modernist irony?  Something like that, anyway...  

Still, sometime in the next week or so I plan to cook some kind of uber roast dinner, so that should get the gods of culinary good taste back on my side.  Also tonight: chocolate, alcohol, strange arabic nut-based sweets, takeaway pizza, and anime.  Should be fun! ^_^
