I have watched the sun set over Iraq, seen the lights of cities glow beneath me, and further out the flourescing military bases, square and uncomfortable amidst the desert.  I have watched the first stars come out over Kuwait, reflected in the orange plumes of oil platforms in the Gulf below.

I am sitting in an aeroplane 33,000 feet from the sea below, eating salmon and cucumber sandwiches, and I'm on my seventh cup of tea.

And, in thirty minutes time, I will land in a country that doesn't speak my language or even use my alphabet, where I am alone, three thousand miles from home.

My wanderlust is sated, and I am loving every minute of this.
