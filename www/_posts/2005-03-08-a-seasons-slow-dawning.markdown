Somehow, I'm left with a sense of achievement despite not really having achieved anything today.  I think many things were achieved around me, and somehow I feel like I was involved.  But whatever the reality is, it certainly feels like the summertime of our hearts and minds is dawning again...  

And back down to Earth.  I have to be up and working in less than six hours.  Also I'm meeting Jodi for lunch, doing two problem sheets in the afternoon, and playing 7th Sea in the evening.  And the week doesn't get any less busy as it goes along.  But somehow, despite it all, I'm happy being this busy.  Summer's dawn, again, I guess.
