Today, Southampton's Dungeon club [announced that it would be closing this weekend](https://www.facebook.com/groups/thedungeonclub/permalink/10153618717957183/). Although it's been a long time since our university days, it's sad to see it go. It's one of the formative places of my youth&mdash;I was introduced to the place at age 18, full of nerves; by 21 the Hobbit and the Dungeon was our regular night out, and we couldn't go to either without running into someone we knew.

I dug through the archive to find some pictures of us all there, and came away with only two&mdash;these were before the days of high-res camera phones, after all. We were young, and clean shaven, and had glow-sticks braided in our hair.

The Dungeon was a place where I found friends; found musical genres and subcultures I never knew before; found laughter and music and dance and magic under the ultraviolet lights.

Thanks for the memories.
