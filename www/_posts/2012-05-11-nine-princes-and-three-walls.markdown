I think I recall reading [Roger Zelazny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Zelazny)'s book _[Nine Princes in Amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Princes_in_Amber)_ as a kid, and enjoying it.  Now the rest of the series sit atop my metaphorical reading list -- not a real pile of books, but a prioritised list of regrets at all the renowned works of fiction that I have not yet read.  I am making my way through them, but with the critical eyes of an adult, I am sure that I am not enjoying them as much as I once would have.

The writing style I can handle, just about, as it fluctuates between overly casual and more traditional fantasy fare.  But what really grates is the continual demolition of the "fourth wall"; the series never lets the reader get absorbed in its world for more than ten pages before they are reminded abruptly of their own.

I've gotten used to the constant [Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) name-dropping -- that he was a patient of Freud's is important to the protagonist, if not especially so for the reader.  It's slightly more bizarre that a character of near-Godlike magical powers compares an obviously magical experience to [Hilbert space](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HilbertSpace.html), or that a mortal from a fantasy world takes to aircraft and modern military tactics without mention of it being weird.

No, what completely threw it for me was a couple of chapters into the third book, _[Sign of the Unicorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_of_the_Unicorn)_, where the already oddly-named character Random casually drops into conversation the line:

> Childe Random to the dark tower came.

Now I'll charitably assume that he was making reference to [Shakespeare](http://www.maximumedge.com/shakespeare/index.php?act=III&scene=IV&play=kinglear&highlight=child+rowland+to+the+dark+tower+came) or  to [Robert Browning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childe_Roland_to_the_Dark_Tower_Came), but _my_ first association of that phrase is Stephen King's _[The Dark Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_(series))_ series -- the result being that I'm forced to consider that the main characters of the _[Chronicles of Amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Amber)_ must have read many works of human fantasy fiction.

Even if I charitably assume that the version of Earth that the Princes of Amber visit does not include Roger Zelazny or the _Chronicles of Amber_ itself, they must surely be aware of the genre and [its tropes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_tropes_and_conventions) -- and now I am aware that the characters I am reading about themselves read books _just like the book I am holding_--

BOOM.  There goes that fourth wall.
