What the hell?  Suddenly, it's the 19th of December.  It's my last day at work before two weeks of Christmas holiday.  But where was the build-up?  Where the sense of the joyous release of the holiday season?

Is it a sign that I'm getting older - or perhaps that I'm the father of a toddler - that I haven't felt excited even at the prospect of two weeks off work?  Truth be told, I've barely noticed that time has passed in the last six months or so.  And only a decade ago, December was far, far too long!

One day, when I have a child that understands instead of a toddler that doesn't, do you reckon I could have that feeling back for a while?
