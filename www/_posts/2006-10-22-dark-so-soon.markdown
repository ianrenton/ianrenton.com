Oh, summer, how quickly you departed...  

Now I leave the house for work in the dark of the pre-dawn morning, and only return as the sky grows dark toward dusk again.  Autumn is here once more and, though the roses still bloom, the first frost will soon come to lay siege to the land.  

There is much to be said for Autumn, and even for Winter, but in the main they are things to be said for those seasons during their brief daytime.  During the day, one might write songs about Autumn's gales or poetry about Winter's snow.  But during the dark nights, as rain batters the windows and the stars no longer shine, I don't like these seasons at all.  

Three whole months until the mornings lighten once more, five until the Spring returns properly, six until the lilac trees bloom again.  

I don't think I'll ever like this part of the year very much.
