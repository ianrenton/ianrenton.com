Bleh, it's getting annoying now... I've been trying to get down to doing my maths coursework for three days now, and still haven't done any...  There's always so much other stuff I end up being distracted by...  So, I'm really gonna have to do a lot of work over the next three days...  

On the plus side, the Dragon's Claw (dunno how long it'll stay called that, but never mind) website has been PHPNuked.  I'm hacking around with it a bit, to see if I can get PHPNuke to do what I want it to do.  You can take a look at the current progress at <a href="http://www.marmablue.co.uk/dc/">http://www.marmablue.co.uk/dc/</a>.
