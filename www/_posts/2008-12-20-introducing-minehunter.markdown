I have been somewhat bored over the last few weeks.  To celebrate my last day of freedom from the whims of Joseph, I with moderate trepidation release what I've been working on: a shitty asteroids-esque game about mine-hunting.

Having spent the whole of an hour writing a generic [Minesweeper game](http://ianrenton.com/software/minesweeper), I figured I'd spend my next few weekends writing a more realistic thing - a game about how minesweeping's actually (sometimes) done.

If you have a spare ten minutes, feel free to waste them on this.  (It's a Java app, so it'll run on whatever OS you have.)

Biggest problem so far: it's not a whole lot of fun.  And the graphics are shit.  Given free time and a book on OpenGL or something, I might fix that.
