I've just arrived home after running the third session of my Dreaming Awake tabletop game.  And holy haddock, it just got really awesome.  The players are finally beginning on the road to realising how the world works and what their place is in it - starting to accept that they can and do change the world.  

At the same time, I'm discovering things too.  I'm discovering just how much I love the setting; I'm getting my first real rewards back from the world I've nurtured for the past seven years.  

It doesn't stop here, though.  The world, the characters and I will keep on changing and being changed by each other for a long time to come.
