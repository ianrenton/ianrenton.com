I've tweeted this already, but just so it goes out to LiveJournal and other blog-followers too:

The great Googly gods have blessed me with a bajillion [Google Wave](http://wave.google.com) invites.  I have 20 left right now.  First 20 people to send me their e-mail address get 'em.

If you don't have another way of contacting me privately, you can use [this contact form](http://www.onlydreaming.net/contact) to tell me your e-mail address.

I'll send out the invites as quickly as I can, but they _won't get to you immediately_.  When I got sent mine originally, it took nearly a week, so don't sit there refreshing your inbox!

Happy waving!
