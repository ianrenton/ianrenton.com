Why is it, that my life seems to revolve around work more and more...  It seems like every evening, I work until gone midnight...  I've done all I think I can do of my maths coursework - I can't really do the last question, it would take a lot of thinking about, and my brain's just not up to it any more.  Maybe I can scrape finishing it off in the lecture tomorrow, if I sit near the back ^_^  

But now, I guess I should relax for a while...  There's lots of t-shirt ideas for the <a href="http://www.ddruk.com">DDRUK</a> Xmas meet that came up on IRC tonight, I'm gonna trawl that and come up with the designs at the weekend.  As well as going shopping, and going to <a href="http://www.anime.org.uk">LAC</a>... eek...
