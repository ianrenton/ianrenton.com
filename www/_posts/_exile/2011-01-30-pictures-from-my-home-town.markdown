It's the end of a remarkably peaceful weekend.  Mornings have been relaxed, afternoons fun, bedtimes trouble-free.  A can't remember a weekend where Joseph had fewer tantrums and I had less stress weighing me down.  It's half past ten on Sunday night and, for the first time in memory, I don't find myself secretly relishing the prospect of peace and quiet at work tomorrow.  For possibly the first time since I became a father, I really would rather be staying at home.
