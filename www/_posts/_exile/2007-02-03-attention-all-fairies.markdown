Yes, this means you - Mark, Andy, Eric, Little Andy, Racheet, Domina, Gemma and Mike!  

Changeling: In Love and War will be making a return!  So, here's what I ask you guys to do, please!  

<b>All of you</b> - Vote on whether to keep the game on <a href="http://www.rpol.net/game.cgi?gi=15577&gn=Changeling:+In+Love+and+War&date=1163066212">RPoL</a> or run it on a <a href="http://www.marmablue.co.uk/index.php?title=Fairyland_Wiki&marmablue_mw__session=e24a1c1153ba998479e2f21450613052">Wiki </a>instead.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each as I'm sure you all realise, but I'd like to do whatever the majority of the players are in favour of.  So, vote now!  

<b>masterofwalri</b>, <b>spin_guy</b> and <b>eric_the_girl</b> - Sorry for the inevitable many-month downtime whilst I was without internets  

!  Rest assured, the game has not died!  

<b>azimov_webb</b> and <b>eldritchreality</b> - You guys haven't posted in a time of length comparable to that of longcat's physical size!  Whether you'd like to stay in the game or whether you'd like to be NPCed, please let me know!  

<b>elegy_of_flames</b> - time to get putting that opening post together, if you still want to do it - or if you want me to get your thread started for you, let me know!  

<b>amateras</b> and <b>tikakino</b> - We need to do the funky chargen thing at some point, so I'll try and pounce upon you next time you venture onto the wonderful world of the internets.  

Thank you!  

(And I'm very, very sorry for the temporary game death...)
