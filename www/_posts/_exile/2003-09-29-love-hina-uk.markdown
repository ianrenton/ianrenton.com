So, it's happened - I've finally made it back to the world of education again. Even though I've lived on my own before, moving to University is the first time I've had to live with people I don't already know. The thing is, I'm wondering if this is some kinda' strange psychological experiment - I'm the only guy out of the 9 occupants of this flat. It's a bit of an odd experience, but we all seem to get along pretty well.  

Seeing as it's Freshers' Week and all, I think I'll be going out every night this week... Still, I've been here less than 24 hours and have already met two old friends, at least a dozen new ones, and made them all ph33r my un-l33t dancing skillz. Maybe that last one wasn't necessarily a great idea, but I figure I might as well just be myself and accept that I like dancing like that...  

There's a ton of forms I've got to fill in, and I've got to register with a GP here, but all that can wait until tomorrow. Well, today really. And I've found out that connecting to the uni network costs Â£150 and takes 7 days to set up... I guess my n MBps connection (where n is large) will have to wait a little longer...
