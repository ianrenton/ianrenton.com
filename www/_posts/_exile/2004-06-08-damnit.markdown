I just had the most awesome dream, but it faded so quickly from my mind...  I remember it was set in London, and some entity that seemed to be God was killing off all the important humans one-by-one.  But then, certain humans were quickly developing magic powers, the powers of ancient dragons I think they were, and the story turned into the reinactment of an ancient draconic war using magickally-adept humans as the dragons' representatives on Earth.  

It was an awful lot cooler at the time than it sounds from what I've just written...
