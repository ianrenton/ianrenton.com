I've been an advocate of opening up our democracy and involving the public in government decision-making for some time, without doing anything particularly concrete about it besides placing my vote.  The Digital Economy Bill fiasco showed us that, really, we're not involved with the day-to-day workings of government at all, and born of that is this experiment.

I'd like to know what we, the people, think our government should be talking about.  I'd like us ordinary people to submit our ideas, vote on other people's ideas, and come up with some idea of what we _really_ care about.  And so here we are:

This is all very experimental at the moment -- please sign up, post ideas, vote on other people's ideas, and if it proves popular I'll take it on as a permanent project.  Let's do this!
