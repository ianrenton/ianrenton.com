A black man is the leader of the free world.  Not only that, but one in whose inaugration speech favourably mentioned Islam, atheism and scientific reasoning.

I think we might be on the right track after all.

Or rather, I think _they_ might.  Because I'm not American.  Before very long, Britain will go to the polls too, and our next great leader will be... Gordon Brown, David Cameron or Nick Clegg.  Excuse me while I am not overflowing with passion.

Granted, the American presidential race exemplifies the same kind "personality before policy" (or hair before policy?) thinking that we grew to hate in Blair, at least there's something to get worked up about.  Obama's inaugration had an audience of _millions_.  Actually there, in person.  Imagine that in London?  Turn up a bit late and you'll be watching it from about... Camden.

So in summary: I'm more excited about the democratic process in someone else's country than my own.  I think British politics needs a heck of a lot more excitement, or possibly that I need to emigrate.
