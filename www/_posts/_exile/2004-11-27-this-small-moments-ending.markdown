And so, another week finishes...  Rarely have I been as glad to finish a week as I have been this time.  So much of the last week was spent working, and although I still technically have a backlog of stuff to do, for now it feels like a few days of peacefulness are stretching ahead of me.  

For now, though - and I don't know why - I'm feeling wide awake and longing for something to do.  I'll probably go and write up some more notes for Dreaming Awake.  

Also, the AvP film is great ^_^  Sooooo cheesy!
