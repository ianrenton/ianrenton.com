Lectures have begun again, with none of the worries or the irritances of last year.  This year, I'm no longer apart from people, but rather everything I do is bringing me closer to my friends.  Life is less of a struggle, but instead is a dance, starting slowly and gradually quickening in tempo.  

Just two more years isn't enough - I want to be immersed in this life forever.  But I suppose it can't; nothing lasts forever.  And in those two years' time both I and the people I like may have become different people altogether.  

But now...  Now, I think it's too early to be worrying about things like that.  Right now I'm accelerating, dancing towards a colourful and shining year of joy and emotion.
