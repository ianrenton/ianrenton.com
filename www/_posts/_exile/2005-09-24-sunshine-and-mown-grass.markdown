So today, it finally decided to be sunny again.  My mission for today: Do something, *anything*, other than moping around the house.  Mission successful!  

I managed to spend about seven hours at my Grandma's, helping to sort out her garden.  I still don't really like gardening very much, but nevertheless it was fun!  One day down, one more to go this weekend.  Tomorrow, I will be mostly washing my hakama and learning to sew.  Should be another busy day!  

After the last time, comments about me becoming a housewife are now officially banned from this thread =p  

Seven days to go.
