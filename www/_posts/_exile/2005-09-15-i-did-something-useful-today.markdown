I did something useful today.  Not work, you realise, because there's precious little of that to do.  Instead, in readiness for the Dreaming Awake game this year, I present: Part One of the rules!  

Today: Character Creation.  Tomorrow: Playing the Game!

Today's output, for players and anyone else who wants to pick holes in it: <a href="http://www.marmablue.co.uk/index.php?title=Dreaming_Awake_Tabletop_Character_Creation">Dreaming Awake Tabletop Character Creation</a>
