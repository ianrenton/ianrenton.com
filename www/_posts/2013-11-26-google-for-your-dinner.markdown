I run Google Analytics code on a number of my websites, as I like to know what's popular&mdash;and maybe deserving of attention&mdash;compared to those sites and pages that languish unvisited. But while Analytics is handy for confirming the obvious and pointing out a few unexpectedly popular pages, it's at its best when it reveals something surprising.

My most popular pages are on the [Raspberry Tank](http://raspberrytank.ianrenton.com)&mdash;where over 50% of visitors are French-speaking, despite the content being only in English.

One other page stands out as unexpectedly popular, and this one is almost exclusively due to the British. My [Great Roast Dinner Timing Chart](http://recipes.ianrenton.com/the-great-roast-dinner-timing-chart) regularly flirts with the top of Google's search results, for no adequately-explained reason.

And so, British culture creeps into my visitor stats. Because Brits love their Sunday roasts, which means Sunday's the day that a hundred or so of them hit the internet to figure out how the heck to make one. And against a background of stable trends from day to day, I get one that looks like this.
