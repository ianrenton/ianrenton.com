Am I... alone? Am I outcast? Am I outside, looking in; or inside, staring out at the world? Am I the last one here; or the first one to leave?

This world is empty... All I have is the darkness, and a single melody playing into the night. Is this the end... or only the beginning? Will this... last... forever?
