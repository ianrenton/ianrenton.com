If you've been paying attention to technology-related news recently, you may have noticed that social network [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) has released a new app for iOS devices called "[Intro](http://blog.linkedin.com/2013/10/23/announcing-linkedin-intro/)". It's a handy tool for people who do a lot of work-related email on their iDevice, as it embeds information from LinkedIn into your emails so you can get a summary of who you're talking to.

Unfortunately it does this not by making Intro a mail client with the extra feature of retrieving this information, but by *rewriting your mail settings to send and receive mail exclusively through LinkedIn's servers*.

In these times where online privacy and security are the subject of [worldwide headlines](http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files), it shouldn't come as a suprise that the app has [been](http://www.darkreading.com/applications/researchers-flag-security-flaws-in-new-l/240163123/) [widely](http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/25/5027334/linkedin-intro-security-concerns-bishop-fox-mandiant) [condemned](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2058260/linkedins-intro-tool-for-iphones-could-be-a-juicy-target-for-attackers.html) for the complete loss of privacy it entails for its users.

But this is just the latest in a long line of dubious methods used by LinkedIn to find connections between its users. It has been accused of [sending email on users' behalf without permission](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/21/4756212/linkedin-accused-of-hacking-user-email-lawsuit) &mdash; indeed, handing over the password to your GMail and Hotmail accounts (ostensibly to harvest your address book) is one of the steps it recommends when you sign up. LinkedIn also [uses names and photos in advertising](http://tempguest.blogspot.co.uk/2011/09/how-to-stop-linkedin-from-using-your.html) by default, and comments on Reddit even say that LinkedIn is recommending people [connect with former residents of their apartment](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1p6x7o/linkedin_intro_app_reconfigures_your_device_so/cczozqv) based on their common IP address.

Added to that list of privacy failings, the [2012 breach of LinkedIn's database](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/06/net-us-linkedin-breach-idUSBRE85511820120606) revealed a major security failing, in that user accounts were stored as unsalted SHA-1 hashes, many of which were easily compromised.

Although the Intro app does not affect me in any way &mdash; I don't use it, and don't have an Apple device to use it on anyway &mdash; it makes it abundantly clear that LinkedIn still do not care about their users' privacy or security. No privacy-conscious Internet users, myself included, should support a company like that.

Make no mistake, by having accounts on LinkedIn we *are* supporting them. [We are not paying; we are the product.](http://lifehacker.com/5697167/if-youre-not-paying-for-it-youre-the-product)

Given that the *only* thing I have received through being a LinkedIn member has been regular nuisance calls from recruitment agencies, I think it is high time I deleted my account. I would encourage all of you to weigh up what you gain from the service against what you lose by handing over your personal information to a company that is highly likely to abuse it.
