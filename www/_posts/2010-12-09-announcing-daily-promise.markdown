After a couple of weeks of development -- documented [here](http://www.onlydreaming.net/blog/daily-promise-design-sketches), [here](http://www.onlydreaming.net/blog/daily-promise-coming-together) and [here](http://www.onlydreaming.net/blog/daily-promise-avatars-everywhere) -- I think I'm ready to call _Daily Promise_ version 1.0.

It's a site that helps you keep track of your promises day-to-day, giving you a pretty display of which promises you've kept when, and letting you compete against your Twitter-using friends to be the best at keeping your daily promises!

For now, you can find Daily Promise at [http://dp.onlydreaming.net](http://dp.onlydreaming.net).

I'll make the same deal as I made with Dynamic Democracy, but doubling the number so that I can be more sure of it taking off, and that's the following:

At the moment the site does everything _I_ want it to do, and it's hosted on a subdomain of my main website, which I have no problem with.  What I would _like_ to do is give it its own domain, and start implementing feature requests that people send in.  So that I don't end up spending money on something that's going to die off quickly, the deal is this: When it gets 20 active users, it gets a domain and some TLC.  If it doesn't make it to that point, it stays like it is.

So if you'd like to help me make something of this site, please start using it, and show it to any of your Twitter-using friends who might need a little help getting healthy, keeping fit or any other goal that Daily Promise can help them with!
