Well, last night was the first time I've actually danced *with* someone in a club... O_O  Not that it's much like dancing, more like just...  moving slightly while rubbing against someone... ;;_;;  Well, I lernt two things there... one, apparently I'm "not assertive enough" - yeah, I could'a told you that...  and second, I guess I'm not much of a physical person... I found it kinda embarassing to touch someone like that... ^_^;;  

Okay, enough with the embarassing stuff...  also last night, someone came up to me on the dancefloor, asked my name, shook my hand, and danced off again... Dunno why, just... random oddness ^_^;;  

Also, it failed to snow last night.  Gah!  Ah well, they're still predicting the chance of snow tonight...
