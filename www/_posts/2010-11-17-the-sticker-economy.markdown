I find it remarkable how much my 3-year-old son -- and presumably by extension most kids his age -- go crazy for stickers.  They don't do anything, besides stick to a wall-chart.  They don't even necessarily have to lead to any better reward (10 stickers and we buy you a toy, etc.).  It's a completely false economy, and yet kids will modify their behaviour just to obtain stickers from their parents.

I started to wonder what age we grow out of that, and start to realise that the reward is so near zero that we're effectively being _tricked_ by our parents into behaving well for no reward.

My conclusion is "never".

[Here is the sticker chart on my wall.](http://foursquare.com/tsuki_chama/badges/all)  Players of [Foursquare](http://www.foursquare.com) and its rivals modify their behaviour -- to give a company a complete list of their location history so that they can use it for marketing purposes.  In return, for each ever more excessive level of location-sharing, you get a sticker on your wall-chart.  And not even a real sticker, just a 100x100 JPEG representing your achievement.

The only reason Foursquare badges appeal to grown-ups and wall-charts in our bedrooms don't is that Foursquare is public and social -- we can compare our badges with others', and strive to have the most.

We never grow out of wanting a sticker.  We just compound it with pride, greed, and the desire to be better than everyone else.  Isn't that _worse_?
