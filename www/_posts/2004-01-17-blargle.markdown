For the second day in a row, I haven't had time to do my laundry.  \o/  I must really stink...  I did manage to go shopping today, so at least I can eat now.  I didn't do any baking, or any revision, though... and now I've got an annoying headache that paracetamol doesn't seem to be shifting, so I had to stay in tonight, rather than going out with everyone to celebrate the arrival of our new flatmate...
