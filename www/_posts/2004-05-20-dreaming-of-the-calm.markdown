Friendship, and...  

...a promise...  

...A decision, for the first time...  

...Worry?  Yes, there's worry...  

...lots of possible futures branch out from today.  

Calm, and simplicity...  

Something I will myself toward,  

but seem forever beaten back from.  

A cryptic diary entry, of course...  

...some things need to be resolved face-to-face, first.  

Bleh... I used to think I wasn't afraid of anything, but it turns out I'm afraid of telling a friend how I feel...
