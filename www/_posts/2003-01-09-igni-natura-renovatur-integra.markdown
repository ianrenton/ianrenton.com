Written as a chapter quote for Dragon's Claw:

*"Fire is the great destroyer.<br/>
It burns cities,<br/>
Scorches forests,<br/>
Crushes armies,<br/>
And reduces our souls to ashes.*<br/><br/>

*But from destruction comes creation.<br/>
The light of a flame dispels the darkness,<br/>
And life begins again.<br/>
Igni Natura Renovatur Integra."*

Ian's note: "Igni Natura Renovatur Integra" is Latin for "All of nature is restored by fire". It's one of the suggested meanings for the acronym "INRI" oftten found in churches. And, for a fairly obvious reason, it fits in Dragon's Claw quite well...
