Meh, and there was me thinking for a while that I was fixed again.  The last few days have been fun, they really have.  And then tonight, humans started to annoy me again.  And then Little Andy started to annoy me.  Deliberately.  And pushed me all the way.  

Ah, Sundancer, I lament that the compulsion to write required me to name you and give you power.  Not power enough, of course, but then I'm a bit glad about that.  

I've also come to the conclusion that my friends aren't faultless anymore.  I used to believe they were; that everything my friends did so obviously had a good reason behind it that I couldn't fault them.  In the end, I guess that was a naive thing to think.  There's bits I dislike about all my friends, now that I think about it.  Of course, they are wonderful in ways that far surpass my dislikes.  But still, they're there, and it feels strange...  

Either way, we approach the end of the third week of the weirdness and I'm still broken.  I suspect it will take until Christmas to properly recover my sanity...
