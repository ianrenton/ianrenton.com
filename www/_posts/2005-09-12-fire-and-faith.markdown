As the majority of readers aren't interested in in-character stuff, I'll avoid a full report of the weekend.  Also I'm just starting to crash, so I can't be bothered with writing a lot.  (At least crashing now will mean I can go to work fully out-of-character tomorrow, which is probably a good thing.)  

Anyway, yes, the weekend just past was shiny and fantastic and wonderful and awesome!  Most of my body has become dinner for mosquitoes and my parents are being sarcastic about roleplaying and whinging about the things I bought while I was there, but this weekend's Maelstrom LARP event was really, really great.  I can't wait for the next one, but I'm going to have to - it's six months away...  

Plans for next time: Save the entire Kamakuran colony.  Pah, should be easy.  Or, um...  Maybe it won't...
