Life passes slowly, when epic things lie ahead.

I have two full days ahead of me as a "free" man, before I am to be married to [the only woman crazy enough to have me](http://www.onlydreaming.net/ericthegirl/).  And, naturally, I am panicking so much that by Friday morning I expect to have exploded in a shower of caffeine and miscellaneous body parts.

I'm sure at this point I'm supposed to be nervous about my choice of wife; that I'd picked the wrong woman and was dooming myself to a life of unhappiness.  Or something.  But the time for worrying about that was a very long time ago.

No, this panic is merely a result of having to organise the biggest thing I have ever organised (by about a factor of 4, in terms of people, or a factor of 400 in terms of the precipitous fall in my bank balance).  The service is organised, though we sent out 30 invites with the wrong time. The reception is organised, though if it rains we'll be an hour early. The DJs haven't replied since I told them "no soppy crap and no 90s boy bands". Flowers might happen at some point, and the cake maker hasn't been in contact for weeks.

Facebook, Twitter, Google Talk are all abuzz with people asking questions; where they should be and when, what to buy, what to bring.  The morning of the wedding is shaping up to be a bizarre and convoluted guest-shuffling exercise.

A wedding appears to be not so much about love, as spending pots of cash on a great big party and going mad trying to make it all happen.  And however it happens, in the end, we'll love each other just as much afterwards as before.

But maybe we'll be people again, not insanely vibrating beings hewn from raw elemental stress.
