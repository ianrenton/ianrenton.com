In last night's dream, courtesy of no alarm-clock wake-up this morning:

  * My cousin-once-removed-in-law (?) actually being my daughter
  * Not having a baby seat on my bike, so lashing her to the cross-bar to ride into town
  * A big party to celebrate Eric giving birth
  * Nick's parents living in a castle with huge grounds
  * Me running around said grounds in sunglasses and a pair of shorts
  * Being laughed at for said attire by people in a gift shop
  * Hundreds of people turning up for a medieval banquet
  * A multi-bird roast, carved by Phil Broadhead and a former Prince of England turned evil
  * Buxom wenches
  * The undead
  * Said undead being despatched by someone-or-other whilst I was in the bathroom
  * Everyone rejoicing and saying I'd got rid of the undead
  * Me waking up, intent on blogging the dream, but discovering that I couldn't type properly and every word I tried to type came out as something completely different
  * Eric telling me not to worry, because I'd remember it anyway.

And I did!  Hurrah.

Joseph has slept in 'til 9:30 and counting in order to facilitate this dream.  I'm thankful!  And quite confused.
