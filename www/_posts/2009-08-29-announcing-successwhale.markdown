For the last few days I've been working on a simple web-based Twitter client, to fill the void between the simplicity of Twitter's own web interface and the broken-in-IE6 complexity of BeTwittered and Seesmic Desktop's web interface.

It's still under heavy development, and there are probably a ton of bugs and missing useful features.  Please give it a try and let me know what you think.  Bug reports are more than welcome!

  * [About SuccessWhale, Source Code, etc.](http://www.onlydreaming.net/software/successwhale)

Update: Due to a move to the proper OAuth API, the software could no longer continue to be called FailWhale, as someone's already written a Twitter app with that name!  Thus, until I or someone else comes up with a good idea, it's called SuccessWhale.
