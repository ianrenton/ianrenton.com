More happy news from the exciting land of joy that is software engineering!<br /><br />Today, on our project, we finally implemented a bug-tracking system!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; Only 1 year 3 months late.&nbsp; However, of course, it couldn't be Bugzilla or any of its cohort - after all, only two people on the project have actually got the hang of Subversion; Bugzilla might just be over the limit.<br /><br />No, we have the Bug <i>Folder</i>.&nbsp; Not, of course, an electronic folder, but a real one with paper inside.&nbsp; Many printouts, in fact, of the "Software Problem Report Form".&nbsp; (Presumably the word "bug" is too common, or just doesn't produce such a good abbreviation.)&nbsp; So, today I generated 5 SPR Forms.&nbsp; They are wonders to behold:<br /><ul><li>They have nowhere to actually assign the bug to someone.&nbsp; So, they just sit in the pile until programmers rifle through them and catch sight of something that they recognise.</li><li>They also have nowhere to mark the bug as fixed.&nbsp; There's a  

signoff at the bottom - for a manager to sign to say that the bug actually <i>exists</i>.</li><li>And, being as they're made of paper, they have to stay in the folder at all times to make sure they don't get lost.&nbsp; So only one person can look through them at once.</li></ul>Work is fun.
