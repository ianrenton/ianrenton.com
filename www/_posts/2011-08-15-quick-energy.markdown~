Late last night, my wife thrust into my hands a bottle of something called ["Quick Energy"](http://www.quickenergy.co.uk), with instructions that I should drink it in the morning, and a minor warning that it might be _absolutely disgusting_.  Well, as a man who is still trying to track down a way of importing [Four Loko](http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Four_(energy_drink)), I guess I have no grounds to decline this.

[![Quick Energy Bottle](http://files.ianrenton.com/sites/blog/2011/08/wpid-IMG_20110815_064224-224x300.jpg)](http://files.ianrenton.com/sites/blog/2011/08/wpid-IMG_20110815_064224.jpg)

The reverse of the bottle informs me that it contains about as much caffeine as "a cup of premium coffee", which as the actual value is 175mg, I am taking to mean "a bucket of filter coffee, premium or otherwise".  It also informs me that "phenylketonurics" may be a word, so if nothing else this vile swill has expanded my vocabulary.

A "niacin flush" is also apparently a thing, which the internet confirms for me.  The bottle describes it as "a warm feeling and skin redness", while some websites describe it as ["annoying, sometimes downright painful"](http://mens-total-fitness.com/niacin-flush.html), but hey, it's getting towards the time of day when I'd happily settle for being lobster-red and in pain for the cause of getting some caffeine inside me.  On which note it suggests I "limit caffeinated products to avoid... occasional rapid heart rate", which seems like it's defeating the point, really.

Taurine is its third most major ingredient, which is a little disconcerting, and though it contains "natural colour" I'm not sure I dare pour this thing into a glass to see what it actually looks like.

Oh, yeah, and it's eight months out of date.

[![Expires, er... Never Mind.](http://files.ianrenton.com/sites/blog/2011/08/wpid-IMG_20110815_064355-e1313408904563-300x224.jpg)](http://files.ianrenton.com/sites/blog/2011/08/wpid-IMG_20110815_064355.jpg)

But hey, it's not like anything on that list of ingredients actually goes off.

I can't quite promise a review ["by the numbers"](http://onlydreaming.net/film-reviews), so we'll go for "by the time" instead:

  * **T-10 minutes:** The presence of this stuff is definitely unnerving.  I'm sure it's no worse than drinking a cup of strong coffee, but somehow the medicine-like qualities give it a worrying edge.

  * **T-5 minutes:** Hands are shaking now.  No, I'm not _that_ nervous.  I suspect low blood-sugar and blood-caffeine levels are to blame here.  At least one of those is about to be rectified.

  * **T-1 minute:** Well, here goes... something. Possibly my brain, possibly my digestive system.

  * **T-10 seconds:** Can't open the bloody bottle. Launch on hold.

  * **T0:** Well, that's... orangey.

  * **T+2 seconds:** Well, that's... foul.

  * **T+5 seconds:** It's like someone took an orange, ground Pro Plus into it and scraped it along my tongue until a human rights group showed up quoting the Geneva Convention.

  * **T+2 minutes:** I probably should have downed it.  This sipping business is taking way too long.

  * **T+7 minutes:** Spacing out now.  My brain feels like it's floating about two inches above the top of my skull.

  * **T+20 minutes:** Spacing out has stopped, and I'm back to standard operating parameters.  I guess "a bucket of coffee" is actually pretty routine for me.  No niacin flush either -- the internet suggests it should have happened by now if it was going to happen at all.

  * **T+1 hour:** Just carrying on as normal.

All things considered, "Quick Energy" was kind of disappointing. I was half expecting to have my brain hot-wired on an insane cocktail of caffeine, taurine and vitamins, but in reality it just does what it implies on the label: provides a pretty normal caffeine-induced energy boost. I can't really find fault with that, only with my hyped-up expectations.

**Verdict:** Good for people that don't like coffee, I guess?
