For the three of you who care, my Telegraph Fantasy Football team picker just got fiddled with.

I had gotten quite annoyed with having to find a machine with a Python interpreter and un-proxied internet access, then downloading the script, every time I wanted to run the damn thing.  So I moved it all online!

The script itself now runs on a nightly cron job, so it should refresh its data every day.  It generates a static HTML page which anyone can view, so several users can get one day's results without running the script multiple times.

Also: This thing beat Alan Hansen and Jose Mourinho last week.  Hah!  Squishy famous football meatbags are no match for software!
