Well, I went back to my parents' place to get some peace and quiet for revision this weekend... and yeah, it was really quiet ^_^;;  I did plenty of revision for the Forces & Fields exam on Tuesday, which I'm happy about... and I got lectured at twice by my parents, which I'm not.  Just because they asked me to do the washing up rather than me doing it on my own, and because I didn't mind what train I took back to Southampton, doesn't mean I "don't show initiative" 0_;;  

Blah... anyways, Electronics exam tomorrow afternoon, should be an interesting waste of two hours...  I haven't really revised, but I can't imagine it'll be particularly taxing...  

Also this weekend, I read "The Wee Free Men" by Terry Pratchett.  So much for it supposedly being a children's book, I think it's one of the best stories he's written...  I guess I'm just a sucker for that kinda' story, and of course stories that are all about the difference between dreams and reality...  It's certainly got a lot in common with Dreaming Awake, but within that there's a fundamental difference.  Whereas The Wee Free Men emphasises the difference between dreams and reality even when they're all mixed up, Dreaming Awake tends towards the opposite, blurring the boundaries further and challenging the perception that one reality is more real than another...
