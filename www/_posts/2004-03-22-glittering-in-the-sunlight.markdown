For the first time this year I went out, and danced in the sunshine.  The warm sun, the chill wind, the damp grass under my bare feet, and the glints of light from my (improvised) sword as it swung around under the beautiful sky...  It's times like these that I believe I can be happy again.  That we can all be happy again...  One day soon, the sun will shine, and it'll never go out...
