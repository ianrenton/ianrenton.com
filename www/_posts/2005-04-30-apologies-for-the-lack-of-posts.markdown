Sorry for not having posted in the last week or so...  I'm afraid nothing especially exciting has been happening.  There was my grandad's funeral, which was... funeral-like, and plenty of Uni work, and seeing friends, and... that's about it.  There's always been *stuff* going on, but it's not seemed like I should be writing about it.  Maybe I just used to write about more stuff than I do now...  

Oh yeah, also, <a href="http://www.marmablue.co.uk">my website</a> has a few bits of new info - mainly setting stuff for DA and FC.  More additions coming soon, if I have some free time this week.
