The dream I just had... it's a rare thing, these days, to have a dream with a proper story - a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Well worth staying in bed for an extra 3 hours for! ^_^  Of course, memories of dreams fade fast, and I can't remember much of the story any more.  But the end...  the final, enduring image of the dream...  Two young people, one male one female, dressed in armour made entirely of multicoloured fist-sized gemstones etched with gold...  Holding similarly gem-studded swords...  Whilst standing on the kind of beach you see in adverts for Caribbean holidays, just staring out to sea.  And the sense of completion, that everything had a happy ending...  

I woke up inspired to write more of <a href="http://ianrenton.com/fiction/dreaming-awake/">Dreaming Awake</a>, but in the end, all I wrote was a LiveJournal entry and yet more introduction to the story.  But I think I was inspired to change the way the structure of the book works.  I think I want to try it with the occasional piece of narration between the chapters, which steadily gets more and more important and intrusive right up to the cataclysm at the end, where you finally realise that the narration is done by Ian/Tsuki, in the brief moment of transcendence...
