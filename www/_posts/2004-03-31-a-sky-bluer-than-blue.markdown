Yesterday and today, temperatures reached 18 degrees C here, and the sky was almost cloudless for most of both days.  Almost felt like Summer was here...  

Anyway, apart from sitting, lying down and walking in the sunshine, over the last few days I've been absurdly busy.  On Tuesday I went to teach my grandparents how to use a computer...  slow work, but they're getting around Windows okay now, and are getting the hang of searching the 'net and e-mailing.  This morning I went to the doctors' to see if they could sort out my toe of doom... Now I have some antibiotics for it that my mum's trying to convince me have to be taken at exactly certain intervals, and exactly four a day, which would mean having to get up at about 6am every day for a week... o_O Scary...  

I'm off to see the NRT project back at QinetiQ in Weymouth tomorrow, which should hopefully go okay... and then it's Friday.  BOURNEMOUTH MEET!
