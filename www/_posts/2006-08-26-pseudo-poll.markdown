Righty everyone, audience participation time.  

A few of you have read my currently ongoing short story, currently called "Bug 23691".  It currently stands at a mere 1500 words and it's 'finished' as a story in its own right.  

However, it would be significantly more awesome as a prologue to a much bigger story.  Possibly 50,000 words' worth.  Which poses a question.  

Do I...  

<ul><li>start writing this now, make it shorter, and finish it while I have enthusiasm for it - but have trouble coming up with ideas for Nano, or...</li><li>save it for Nano in November, hope I still have enthusiasm for it then, and find something else to write in the meantime?</li></ul>  

VOTE NOW!
