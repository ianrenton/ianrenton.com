It's finally reached that time.  Despite the furniture in the car and the eight boxes of books in the garage, not to mention the three bin liners full of stuff for charities or throwing away, my room's still so full I can't get to the bed.  God knows how I'm going to fit all of this into the flat, anyway.  

But that's what I will be doing, a mere 12 hours from now.  The contract signed, the first month's rent paid...  The flat is ours.  Tomorrow, we move in.  

I'm not sure how I feel about it.  Excited, maybe.  Nervous, certainly.  Stressed, maybe a bit.  I'll be glad once this is all sorted out, and we have a home to ourselves.
