A little late to post I know, but I graduated on Monday.  It was an awesome day, and could only really have been improved by the theatre in which we had to sit, fully robed, for 90 minutes, having been air conditioned.  

We baked in there ;;_;;  

Still, it's one of those moments in which you come to realise something about what University is all about...
