Ladies and Gentlemen of the Internet, I am pleased to announce that [SuccessWhale](http://onlydreaming.net/software/successwhale) version 2.0 has just been released and is now live on [SuccessWhale.com](http://www.successwhale.com).

SuccessWhale is a web-based client for Twitter and Facebook, written in PHP, JavaScript and MySQL.  It offers a multi-column view that allows users to merge together information from all their connected accounts and view it at a glance from any web browser.

The big changes between version 1.1.2 and 2.0 are:

  * Facebook support
  * Support for multiple Twitter (and Facebook) accounts
  * As many columns as you want
  * Columns that combine multiple feeds
  * Lightboxed images from Twitpic and yFrog
  * New themes
  * Numerous bug fixes!

You can see a screenshot of it in action below:

I would particularly like to thank [Alex Hutter](http://twitter.com/aefaradien), [Hugo Day](http://twitter.com/Tontonis), [Erica Renton](http://twitter.com/eric_the_girl) and [Rg Enzon](http://twitter.com/rgenzon), whose help in finding bugs and suggesting new features has been instrumental in bringing SuccessWhale up to version 2.0 today.
