Right, so, I watched Iron Man again, and came away with the same three conclusions.  To whit:

  1. Pepper Potts is totally hot.

  2. Samuel L Jackson is, indeed, a badass.

  3. The defence industry in the real world is insufficiently cool.

_Warning, maths and geek-faggotry ahead._

So, I am thinking.  [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ_qR8zCLDc) is Lockheed Martin's HULC exoskeleton, that allows the user to comfortably carry 200 lb.  Let's give a liberal 50 lb of that to the battery, so 150 lb to play with.

A liberal estimate of body surface area might be [2 metres squared](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_surface_area), and let's stick that up to 3 metres squared to count for clothing, padding etc.

So 150 lb over 3 metres squared is 50 lb/m^2, or 22.6 kg/m^2.  Titanium has a density of 4.54 g/cm^3, 4540 kg/m^3.  So we could coat the entire body in 22.6/4540 = 5 mm thick titanium.  That's gotta be pretty effective against small arms fire if nothing else, and there must be a hundred things better at stopping bullets than titanium.  (Fabric composite materials like kevlar?  Ceramics?)

tl;dr can has power suits now plzkthx?
