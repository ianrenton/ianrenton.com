Recently, since I've been staying at my parents' house, I've been walking near a lot of the places I used to go as a child, and the close encounters have been sparking a lot of memories in my mind.  Therefore, my mission for this week (or even this summer/early autumn as a whole) is to get as many of my childhood memories down on paper as possible.  On Saturday, hopefully, I'll grab my mum's camera and go and visit the places properly, to find out what's become of them now I've - dare I say it - grown up.  

I'm putting the results on the 'net for anyone to read, should they desire:

A warning - it's already pretty long, just from one day's work...
