I'm Ian Renton, a software engineer and builder of robots, from Bournemouth on the south coast of Britain.

By day, I am a software and systems engineer in the naval defence industry, specialising in command & control of autonomous vehicles and communications networks.

By night I build robots and web applications, alongside being a husband, father and amateur cook.
