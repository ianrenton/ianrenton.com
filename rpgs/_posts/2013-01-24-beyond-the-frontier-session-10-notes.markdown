title: Beyond the Frontier -- Session 10 Notes
---

Run time: 2h<br/>

The main party arrives at a tavern. Harry's ash makeup is wearing off... One possible brawl later, the party explores the city and ends up inside the castle by obvious or by sneaky means. At one point they reach a huge shut doorway though which they can hear raised, booming voices. "He did what?!" etc. The King is finding out what his son has done.

As the party listens, it dawns on them that there are soldiers standing behind them. Bluffing time!

If they're unsuccessful, commotion begins and the King comes through the door to sort it. If they're successful, the soldiers leave, characters find a way to get an audience with the king?

The king is astounded that creatures of the realm had made it here. Discusses the problem of his son frankly. Suggestions of an Oberon/Titania style relationship between him and the Forestborn Queen?

King dispatches soldiers to track down his errant son. Later they return in force -- to take the King prisoner. And the full scale of the mutiny is apparent.<br/>

--<br/>

MEANWHILE...<br/>

Dan, Ailsa and Ika find a lava chamber full of machinery that seems to focus magical energy. Ailsa manages to restore some vitality using it. Then...

"I hope this doesn't affect your plans..."

And she "infects" it with green-ness which slowly starts spreading.

"We'd better get out of here before the priests arrive. To the city. That's where it will all happen."

End session.<br/>
