<h4>Notes for all players</h4>

This is a map of the tiny mountain region of Kingswald.  As you have read in the intro story, it is nothing more than a few villages clustered about a couple of valleys that have come together for their mutual survival.  All of your life has been spent in and around these villages, up mountains or in the forest -- but not <em>too</em> deep in the forest.  Whether you can see a future for yourself in Kingswald or you plan to follow the road south at the first opportunity, right now, this is the world you know.

If you can imagine <em>Wuthering Heights</em> set in Tibet (with elves), that's not far off the mark.
