<p>This page details the system and rules of the Dreaming Awake tabletop game.  As it is heavily based on White Wolf&#039;s  New World of Darkness (&#039;nWoD&#039;) game, only the ways in which Dreaming Awake&#039;s system differs from nWoD are present  here.  A version that assumes no prior knowledge may follow, but as that&#039;s rather a lot of information I recommend just buying an nWoD core book anyway.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Imagery</b></p>
<p><i>Imagery</i> is a new effect in Dreaming Awake.  It represents the fact that characters have particular concepts,  images or physical things with which they particularly identify.  Characters that are actively using their  <i>Imagery</i> when performing an action receive a bonus.  "Actively using" is not a particularly clear-cut thing  considering how wide a range of Images a character might have, so the following examples are provided to help.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Fire:</i> Being a physical, tangible thing, the effects of having this Image are simple.  A character with  &#039;Fire&#039; as one of her images will receive the bonus when dealing with fire, either physical or magical.  Cooking over  a fire, combating a forest fire and throwing fireballs are all things she will find slightly easier.</li>
<li><i>Winter:</i> Whilst a physical thing, &#039;Winter&#039; is not quite tangible.  The character does <i>not</i> receive a  bonus for everything she does when it is Winter.  Rather, she must use the idea of Winter in her action, for example  by dressing up warm, magically causing snow, etc.</li>
<li><i>Envy:</i>Most tricky are images that aren&#039;t physical at all, such as emotions.  A character with the &#039;Envy&#039;  Image receives a bonus not through being a generally envious person (if she has it as an image, that would probably  be all the time!) but rather when envy is the cause of her action, such as stealing.</li>
</ul>
<p>When performing an action that actively uses one of a character&#039;s Images, add the number of dots in the relevant  Image(s) to the dice pool for that action.  For example, a character attempting to remain hidden in shadows would  normally be rolling a number of dice equal to her <i>Dexterity</i> + <i>Stealth</i>.  If she had the image &#039;Shadow&#039;,  she would roll <i>Dexterity</i> + <i>Stealth</i> + <i>Shadow</i> instead.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Health</b></p>
<p>The character sheet contains boxes in which to record <i>Health</i> levels exceeding 10 dots.  Due to the epic nature  of the game characters will eventually become somewhat superhuman, in much the same manner as ancient heroes such as  Hercules or Odysseus - more creations of mythology than of flesh and blood.  Whilst 10 dots of <i>Health</i> may be  the limit of human capability, a character&#039;s increasing renown may cause these values to rise above this value.</p>
<p>A character will receive extra health points as their <i>Shiny</i> value increases, or more quickly if one of their  <i>Fames</i> implies that they are particularly healthy.</p>
<p>The character&#039;s normal 10 <i>Health</i> points are expended first when any injury is received.  If the character has  10 or less total <i>Health</i> points, she will be knocked unconscious (bashing) or killed (lethal / aggravated) when  they are all depleted.  If she has more than 10 total <i>Health</i> points, she will not suffer this fate until all  her additional points over and above 10 are also depleted.</p>
<p>Assuming the character survives the battle her normal <i>Health</i> points heal at the normal rates for bashing,  lethal or aggravated damage.  To heal the damage to her supernatural <i>Health</i> points, news of how much punishment she  took without dying will have to be spread.  If an NPC witnessed the battle, this should not be a problem!</p>
<p>Because the world of Dreaming Awake physically reacts to the will of its people, there is a special way in which death can be avoided.  If a character would lose the last of her health points to bashing damage (and thus normally would be knocked unconscious), she can choose to spend a point of <i>Willpower</i> to give herself a temporary health point - and thus remain conscious.  If a character would lose her last point to lethal or aggravated damage, which would normally cause death, the trauma involved causes the effect to happen automatically, assuming the character has at least one dot of temporary Willpower left.</p>
<p>In both of these cases - both deliberate and automatic - a <i>Sanity</i> check must be rolled.  As in the section on &#039;Actions using Fame&#039;, the ability to impose your will on the world in such a direct manner does not come without its consequences.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Willpower</b></p>
<p>As with <i>Health</i>, a character&#039;s <i>Willpower</i> can also rise above the normal human limit of 10 dots.  A character will receive extra willpower points as their <i>Shiny</i> value increases, or more quickly if one of their <i>Fames</i> implies that they are particularly strong-willed.</p>
<p>There is nothing particularly special about these supernatural <i>Willpower</i> points - they are used and regenerated just as ordinary willpower.</p>
<p>In Dreaming Awake, <i>Willpower</i> is regenerated by resting, at a rate of approximately 1 willpower dot per two hours of rest or sleep.  Certain activities that characters find particularly enjoyable can also restore <i>Willpower</i>.</p>
<p>For more information on how Willpower is used in Dreaming Awake, see the section on Actions Using Fame.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Sanity</b></p>
<p><i>Sanity</i> is the Dreaming Awake version of Morality in vanilla nWoD.  Every time your character experiences something that properly disturbs them, you must roll for a decrease in <i>Sanity</i>.  Rolls, and the effects of decreasing Sanity/Morality, can be found in the nWoD core book.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Magic</b></p>
<p>There are two kinds of effects possible in Dreaming Awake that could be termed &#039;magic&#039;.  This section explains the simpler of the two.</p>
<p>Magic is widely believed in in Avalon.  No-one denies that witches, wizards, spells, demons and all those manner of things exist.  A character can cast a spell she knows - whether she&#039;s learnt it or by reading it from a book, etc. - using a standard roll such as <i>Intelligence</i> + <i>Occult</i>.</p>
<p>Despite the widely believed existence of magic, it is not easy to learn.  Without training, even a single dot of <i>Occult</i> is hard to come by.  This means that any user of this kind of magic likely has (or had) one or more teachers, or if not has put a great deal of effort over many years into solitary study.</p>
<p>Even once learnt, magic is not easy to use.  Although one success on a magic roll is enough to make magic happen, it takes multiple successes (as decided by the GM) in order for the spell to occur exactly as intended with no side-effects.  For this reason, having <i>Fame</i> as a magic-user is important to make things go more smoothly.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Actions Using Fame</b></p>
<p>If your character wishes to perform a trivial action, she just does it.</p>
<p>If she wishes to perform a more complicated, or a contested, action - you describe it and the GM tells you what to roll and how many successes you need.</p>
<p>However, there will be times when your character needs or wants to do something which is far beyond her normal capability.  It&#039;s here that <i>Fame</i> comes into play.</p>
<p>Avalon is a dream world, a world where one&#039;s thoughts and desires can take physical form.  Much like when we dream lucidly, a character in Dreaming Awake can command the world around her to conform to her wishes.  This is the <i>real</i> magic of Dreaming Awake, and tutors and spell books are not involved.</p>
<p>When you wish your character to do something above and beyond her normal capabilities, describe the action to the GM.  As usual, the GM will tell you which attribute and skill to roll, and how many successes you will need.  This number will be high, almost impossible to obtain rolling just your mundane attribute and skill - even with <i>Imagery</i> added in.  This is where you rely on your fame.</p>
<p>Of course, your character knows what she&#039;s capable of - but she&#039;s just one person.  What <i>everyone else</i> thinks she&#039;s capable of has a real, tangible effect on reality.  That&#039;s what <i>Fame</i> embodies - the actual effect on the character of what people <i>believe</i> she can do.</p>
<p>If you have 1 dot in &#039;Good Public Speaker&#039; as a <i>Fame</i>, you can be better at speaking to people for the sole reason that your audience is expecting it - a relatively minor effect.  On the other hand, take the example of Hercules.  Virtually <i>everyone</i> knows what he was famous for his strength.  His character sheet might declare him to have 50 dots in &#039;Exceptional Strength&#039; - there&#039;s practically nothing he couldn&#039;t lift.</p>
<p>Back to your exceptionally difficult action.  Assuming your attribute + skill + imagery roll isn&#039;t likely to produce anywhere near enough successes, and the character is famous for something relevant to the action, you can spend a point of <i>Willpower</i> to will the belief in your abilities into actual physical effect.  This adds to your result a number of <i>automatic successes</i> equal to the number of dots you have in the <i>Fame</i>.</p>
<p>Still not enough?  You can use your own <i>Willpower</i> to try and force it.  Since those around you seem to think the action is beyond you, you&#039;ll have to prove them wrong - and it won&#039;t be easy.  You can use more <i>Willpower</i> points in addition to the one already spent to add more automatic successes in order to achieve your target.  However, if you do this you must then make a <i>Sanity</i> check.  The ability to impose your will on the world in such a direct manner does not come without its consequences.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Examples of Super-Human Abilities</b></p>
<p>When playing Dreaming Awake, your characters will come across challenges they cannot face with just their mundane capabilities - their <i>Fame</i> must be used to aid them.  There is no set list of things that are possible at certain levels of Fame.  Rather, there are things that are possible and they have a number of successes required to achieve them.  A lot of these will require the use of Fame in normal circumstances.</p>
<p>The following table contains brief descriptions of some actions that characters may wish to do.  The rows of the table give a guide to the number of successes that should be achieved to make this action happen.  The columns of the table are headed with some potential Fames that could be used to assist with the actions listed below them.</p>

<p>There are also some abilities particular to the meta-plot of Dreaming Awake that will become apparent as the game progresses.  Characters will not have any idea that they are possible until late in the game.  These are, in general, the most difficult things to achieve and consequently have very high numbers of successes required.  One character is as likely as any other to acheive them, as they are based not on a specific <i>Fame</i> but on <i>Shiny</i> - that is, the sum of all the character&#039;s Fames.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Shiny</b></p>
<p>As mentioned at the end of the previous section, <i>Shiny</i> represents the sum of a character&#039;s <i>Fames</i>.  It is separate on the character sheet merely for convenience rather than having to manually sum all your Fame values every time you wish to know your Shiny value.</p>
<p><i>Shiny</i> is a measure of how much of a legend your character has become.  The higher your Shiny rank, the more people around the world know who you are and what you are capable of.</p>
<p>The player characters&#039; <i>Shiny</i> is used by the GM to keep the meta-plot of Dreaming Awake progressing at a pace set by the characters&#039; progression.</p>
