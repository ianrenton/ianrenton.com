title: Beyond the Frontier -- Session 7 Notes
---

Run time: 2h (HOW?!)

&nbsp;

RETURN TO THE CAVES

&nbsp;

Plan to collapse rocks in to destroy lava chamber. Danfox to measure out the correct position, Forestborn priests to tear the earth apart with roots.

For anyone down in the dungeon: encounter with 2x Salamanders as the hot rocks cool. Pumps can be broken with 20 damage (immediately if the rocks drop). In front of the faded portal, nothing happens -- no army.

&nbsp;

FORESTBORN ENCLAVE

&nbsp;

The priests of the Forestborn could temporarily redirect the portal to Granite's aspect of their world. Hopefully this time the characters get prepped and go through.

End session.
