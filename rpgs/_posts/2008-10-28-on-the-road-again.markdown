<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As Cain and Ilandra rode Hawthorn away from the former Hyacinth Castle<br />
across the field of poppies, the landscape shifted around them.<br />
Afternoon sunlight became overcast, the poppies faded into grass, and<br />
ahead of them a cottage stood alone on the slope of a hill.</p>
<p>They had, through the traditional geographical implausibility, arrived in Honeysuckle kingdom.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Right, and now we get provisions..." Ilandra said, leaping from Hawthorn&#039;s back and running into the cottage.</p>
<p>She let herself in and ran up the stairs, pausing briefly to remove her<br />
worn out slippers, to get herself a change of clothing. Barely paying<br />
attention to Cain entering, she slowed and entered her room where she<br />
flung the wardrobe open.</p>
<p>"Ah, home already your Grace?" came the disinterested voice of her<br />
butler. "I see your dress hasn&#039;t survived whatever you&#039;ve been doing in<br />
your absence. And hello, Prince Cain. I believe you&#039;ll find Ilandra in<br />
there, disorganising the room. I suppose you&#039;d better make yourself at<br />
home, really."</p>
<p>Ilandra looked over at the butler, holding a dress up to herself. There<br />
were three more at her feet, with four pairs of shoes on top of them.</p>
<p>"Cain, if you don&#039;t have any coats that don&#039;t have poppies on them then<br />
I can lend you a coat from Lysander&#039;s wardrobe..." she told him.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Um...  If it&#039;s all the same to you, I&#039;d rather not wear<br />
Lysander&#039;s clothes.  Are we expecting to have to disguise<br />
ourselves again?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Well, you never know." she said, shrugging. "I just don&#039;t want you to get hurt while we&#039;re out there..."</p>
<p>She ducked behind a screen and changed into her new dress.</p>
<p>"We ought to pick up supplies so we don&#039;t need to find any villages any<br />
time soon." she told him, wandering out into the hallway.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Right.  Yes," said Cain vaguely, following Ilandra.<br />
"Couldn&#039;t your butler fetch things?  Er...  How long are we<br />
going to be away for this time, anyway?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"He could... but then I&#039;d have to tell him how long we plan to be gone<br />
for..." she replied, checking the coast was clear. "...and truth be<br />
told, I haven&#039;t decided yet! I did however come up with an idea... What<br />
if WE did some detective work and figured out stuff about the black<br />
roses?"</p>
<p>Having seen the coast was clear, she dragged Cain down the stairs and<br />
into the kitchen without giving him a chance to reply. Before he could<br />
string a thought together she told him her newest plan.</p>
<p>"Besides, I figured if we got your mother a boyfriend she&#039;d stop<br />
bugging us for a date and we could relax..." she finished, reaching<br />
into a cupboard and grabbing biscuits.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Black Roses?  A boyfriend?" Cain asked as he proffered his bag to<br />
Ilandra to fill.  "What&#039;s going on?  I&#039;m confused.<br />
Besides, I&#039;m not sure there <i>is</i> a man out there who would live up to my mother&#039;s standards."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Right. The plan is that we investigate the black roses cos Akane<br />
mentioned that she wanted to do so at your mother&#039;s big party and then<br />
got caught up in all this mess." she told him, filling his bag with<br />
sweets. Having emptied out the sweet jars she moved onto the next<br />
cupboard which she duly emptied of fudge and marshmallows.<br />
"Anyway, it&#039;s not like the guy HAS to measure up to any standards...<br />
she only mentioned two criteria for her next suitor. All we have to do<br />
is find one who is richer and more powerful than her and she&#039;ll be<br />
happy." She jumped down from the worktop, having exhausted her sweet<br />
supply. "So we&#039;ll start with the Chrysanthemums and move on from<br />
there..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Chrysanthemums?  But... isn&#039;t there already a Duchess<br />
Chrysanthemum?  And a Prince and a Princess, for that<br />
matter?  I think splitting them up might take a little more than<br />
"my mum might want to marry you, but she doesn&#039;t know it yet".</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked a little dismayed by the information.</p>
<p>"Well, we could always ask them about the black roses and see what we find out..." she said. "Or we could try House Pansy..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I suppose we could, yes.  Though we&#039;d have to be pretty<br />
subtle...  Wait, Pansy?  You remember Duke Pansy,<br />
right?  I&#039;m not sure he and my mother would really... work."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"No... I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen him..." Ilandra thought it over, leading<br />
Cain out through the back door of the kitchens. "Which one&#039;s Duke<br />
Pansy?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"You know - huge guy, big beard, wears plate mail to the dinner<br />
table?  I can&#039;t see the two of them getting on.  Well, I can<br />
see my mother regarding civilising him as a kind of project, but I<br />
can&#039;t see how we&#039;d make <i>him</i> spend any time at all with <i>her</i>."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>A smile broke out on her face.</p>
<p>"Oooh a project!" she cooed. "Well, we can&#039;t possibly pass up the chance for such an interesting project..."</p>
<p>They wandered through an alley to find Hawthorn exactly where Cain had left him.</p>
<p>"Well come on then, we have a beardy man to see!" she told him, waiting for him to mount up.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Yeah.  Yeah, sure," sighed Cain.  "What could possibly go wrong?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Oh come now, dearest, why are you acting like it&#039;s a bad idea?" she<br />
said, jumping onto the horse in front of him. "Hawthorn, please tell<br />
him it&#039;s a great idea!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I go wherever he goes," said Hawthorn.  "Just try not to get too<br />
close to a battle.  There are armies out there much bigger than<br />
you.  He will be at the front of a big one."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Huh? He&#039;s in battle? Well, I guess I could put on the Field Medic kit<br />
and go find him..." she said, musing. Reaching into her bag, she pulled<br />
out two boxes, one was a little box with Honeysuckle patterns on it and<br />
the other had yellow flowers pressed into it. She handed the smaller<br />
one to Cain. "Could you keep hold of this, I&#039;ll let you know when<br />
you&#039;ll need it."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Right," said Cain, putting the box into Hawthorn&#039;s saddlebags.<br />
"So, you&#039;re really serious about trying to find Pansy?  I,<br />
um...  Last I heard, the main contested land was Birch.  If<br />
we&#039;re going to find him anywhere, it&#039;s probably there..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"OK." Ilandra practically chirped. "I haven&#039;t yet had a chance to try this thing out..." She patted the box.<br />
"Hmm, Birch... Birch... Oh, that&#039;s end of the lane and turn... I think<br />
left." she muttered thoughtfully. "Well, I think it is and I&#039;m the<br />
Duchess, so it&#039;s end of the lane and turn left now."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, er... If you say so, I suppose it is."</p>
<p>Together they rode down the lane, turned left, and continued on as the rutted track faded into forest.</p>
<p>Minutes past, and a kind of mist descended as the trees became thicker<br />
and thicker.  Before very long, plagued by low branches, the two<br />
of them had to dismount and lead Hawthorn across increasingly bumpy<br />
terrain.  A feeling swept over them, slowly and subtly first, but<br />
gradually picking up until it was unavoidable.</p>
<p>A sensation of <i>cold</i>, of <i>deep</i>, and of <i>old</i>.  They had entered the duchy of House Birch.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra shuddered at the feeling.</p>
<p>"Well, it looks like we&#039;re here..." she said, injecting cheer into her voice. "Best find the Duke then..."</p>
<p>They walked on in the woods for a while until the trees began to clear.</p>
<p>Ilandra turned to Cain.</p>
<p>"Are we walking or riding?" she asked, tangling her fingers in his.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>They rode, once the trees had sufficiently thinned, and before long<br />
they found themselves on a dirt track that wound its way out of the<br />
forest and onto heathland punctuated with gorse bushes.  The sun<br />
was weak, here, even though it still felt like Spring.</p>
<p>Mist closed around them up on the high ground, and it was some time -<br />
possibly minutes, possibly hours - before they could see anything but<br />
ten feet around them.</p>
<p>When at last the land declined, they rode down onto a wide plain.<br />
Hills stretched away from them to the left and right, but ahead, below<br />
them...   Below them there camped an army the like of which<br />
they had never seen.  Thousands, tens of thousands of men and<br />
women scurried about their business.  As they watched, tents and<br />
pavilions were erected, temporary defences dug, wood collected and<br />
cooking-fires lit.  No fewer than a thousand horses and<br />
accompanying wagons stood around waiting to be directed.</p>
<p>Cain and Ilandra stood, eyes wide and mouths agape.  Down on the<br />
plains stood perhaps ten times the entire population of House Poppy,<br />
but there were no civilians here.</p>
<p>Their stunned contemplation was broken by a <i>thunk</i> noise distressingly close to them.  Hawthorn snorted, but did not rear.  He&#039;d seen worse.</p>
<p>Ilandra and Cain barely had chance to consider the arrow sticking out<br />
of the ground a few feet in front of them, when a group of four men<br />
emerged from behind bushes.  They all wore green and brown, though<br />
what few insignia they bore were embroidered in red.</p>
<p>"Stay where you are!" barked one of them.  "Name yourselves!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra pulled out a white handkerchief from her pocket.</p>
<p>"I am Ilandra of House Honeysuckle and this is Prince Cain, he is<br />
accompanying me on my journey." she told them, only realising after<br />
she&#039;d said it that she hadn&#039;t mentioned which house he was from.</p>
<p><i>Oh well, it&#039;s not like he can&#039;t set them straight...</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain coughed.  "Er...  That&#039;s <i>Duchess</i> Ilandra of House Honeysuckle, and Prince Cain of House <i>Poppy</i>," he said, making sure his signet ring was very clearly visible.</p>
<p>The leader of the group looked back and forth at the two of them, then<br />
nodded.  The three peasant soldiers who stood around him relaxed.</p>
<p>"Your Grace, Your Highness," the Sergeant said, bowing to Ilandra first and then Cain.  "How may I help you?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra waved her hands dismissively.</p>
<p>"Seriously, you can just call me Ilandra... I don&#039;t mind." she said.<br />
"We&#039;re kinda looking for Duke Pansy... Have you nice lads seen him?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Pansy?  You&#039;re about twenty miles too far South, your Grace,"<br />
said the soldier.  He had a brief moment of worry, and turned to<br />
Cain.</p>
<p>"We <i>can</i> tell her Grace-" he questioned, before Cain interrupted him with a nod.</p>
<p>The soldier resumed talking to Ilandra.</p>
<p>"Pansies and Red Rose Second Division are further north, proceeding<br />
east along the southern extent of the foothills.  We rendezvous<br />
with them at noon tomorrow and continue east to engage the Whites<br />
sometime after that.  I don&#039;t know exactly when, but I would<br />
imagine they plan for it to be in the morning, two days hence."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"OK, do you think they&#039;ll let us tag along then?" she asked Cain. He nodded.</p>
<p>"Could we tag along with you please?" she asked the soldiers.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"With the army?  I would imagine so."</p>
<p>He turned to the others.  "Shara, take &#039;em down to camp.  Let the Baron know."</p>
<p>"Sir," replied Shara, revealing herself to be, in actual fact,<br />
female.  With the dimming light along with the soldiers&#039; bulky<br />
clothes and muddy faces, it was quite hard to tell.</p>
<p>"Follow me," she said, and led Ilandra and Cain on down the track.</p>
<p>When they turned around to check behind them, all traces of the Sergeant and his two other soldiers had disappeared.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra&#039;s grip on Cain&#039;s arm tightened slightly, indicating she was nervous.</p>
<p>"So, my way into Birch was a little off the mark..." she mumbled.<br />
"...but it&#039;s OK, we found your allies. How&#039;re you doing, Hawthorn?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well," said Hawthorn.  "We are among allies now.  This is better than not being so."</p>
<p>The scout Shara led them down the hill and through the already<br />
substantial camp, weaving between tents of all shapes and sizes.<br />
No-one spoke to them or interrupted their passage, and the vast<br />
majority of the soldiers they passed were too busy to give them even a<br />
second glance.  Well-trained, then.</p>
<p>After a while they reached a large white pavilion tent, with two guards<br />
outside.  Cain and Ilandra dismounted, staying a few yards back,<br />
while Shara spoke to them.  One nodded, and disappeared inside the<br />
tent for a moment.  Shara bowed to the visitors before melting off<br />
into the evening gloom.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the guard re-emerged from the tent and signalled<br />
for them to come inside.  With a click of his fingers, he summoned<br />
a much scruffier-looking soldier to take care of Hawthorn.</p>
<p>Inside the tent, paraffin lamps lit banners and paintings that hung<br />
from all the walls.  So decorated was the place that one quickly<br />
forgot that one was inside a tent at all.  On a large wooden<br />
chair, it too extensively decorated, sat a rather large man wearing<br />
chainmail.</p>
<p>"Goot evening, Duchess, Prince," he said in a rather booming<br />
voice.  "I am ze Baron von Richtoven, nephew ov Duke David ov ze<br />
House ov ze Red Rose and Commandant of ze Third Divison.  To vat<br />
do I owe ze pleasure ov your company so far from home?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked around in fascination, only barely realising that she&#039;d just been addressed.</p>
<p>"Oh, er... Well... I was planning on checking that the troops are all<br />
happy with the service they&#039;ve received from the Honeysuckle hospital.<br />
Admissions have been at an all-time high recently and I thought I&#039;d<br />
check..." she said.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I am not in ze least bit surprised, I am afraid," said the<br />
Baron.  "Viz ze tide having turned somewhat and ze Reds now on ze<br />
offensive again, zere vill be ze inevitable casualties as ve gain more<br />
land.</p>
<p>"Und you?" he asked, turning to Cain.</p>
<p>"I am engaged to marry Ilandra," he said.  "Since she insists on going to the most dangerous of places, I go with her."</p>
<p>"A sensible plan," said the Baron.  "Vell zen, iz zere any vay in vich I might assist you both?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I wanted to meet Duke Pansy." Ilandra said. "It seemed as good an idea as any..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Pansy, eh?"  The Baron looked a little confused, but assumed that the woman must have her reasons.</p>
<p>"Are you going to tell him to stop killing so many people, perhaps?" he<br />
asked, and chuckled.  "Vell, you are almost in ze right<br />
place.  Ve meet viz his army tomorrow at about midday.  If<br />
you do not mind marching vis us tomorrow, I am sure we can deliver ze<br />
two of you intact.  I vould advise you against ze alternative; zis<br />
land iz contested and it vould not be a good idea for two unarmed<br />
people to be vandering around on zeir own.</p>
<p>"Be varned, zo.  Ve march to var.  Once ve rendezvous vis our<br />
allies, ve vill be around a day&#039;s march from ze White forces.<br />
Vatever business you have viz Duke Pansy - or viz any of us - I advize<br />
you do it qvickly and stay far away from any fighting.  Duke Pansy<br />
himself takes a very... direct approach to combat.</p>
<p>"Furzermore," he said, turning exclusively to Ilandra, "I advize you to<br />
take extra care for ze sake of your House.  If you vish to remain<br />
Neutral for very long, I would suggest you let as few people az<br />
possible see you travelling viz us."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"You&#039;re quite right. Erm... see after seeing Duke Pansy my plan was to<br />
find the two Rose dukes and ask a favour..." she said, fidgeting with<br />
her sleeves. "So I don&#039;t mind marching with you and I can take some<br />
steps towards not being seen by the other side."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"<i>Both</i> Rose Dukes?" the Baron asked.  "Vell, I suppose <i>zat</i><br />
would ensure you appeared somevat neutral.  I am not sure ze<br />
Whites vill accept you qvite so easily as ve.  Particularly not<br />
viz ze Prince here in tow."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Yes, I can see how he might be a bit of a problem..." she said, mock<br />
seriously. "I had thought about that and that&#039;s why I was sort of<br />
planning my next excursion without him." She dropped her voice. "Though<br />
I hadn&#039;t told him that yet..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Anyway," said Cain, "we can talk about that later.  For now,<br />
Baron, if we could request a bed for the night, or at least somewhere<br />
to put our bags for the moment?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," von Richtoven said.  "Guard!"</p>
<p>One of the guards to his tent came inside, and saluted.  "Sir!"</p>
<p>"Which Captain leads your brigade?"</p>
<p>"Jameson, Sir."</p>
<p>"Tell him he&#039;s bunking with the lieutenants tonight.  Take these two with you, they&#039;re taking his tent for now."</p>
<p>"Sir!" he said, saluting again.  He turned to Ilandra and Cain.  "If you would follow me, please?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra took off her signet ring and put it into her pocket then followed behind Cain and the guard.</p>
<p>"Do you think the Captain will mind?" she asked Cain.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"You&#039;re velcome to return here during ze evening, should you feel<br />
yourselves bored!" the Baron called after them as they followed the<br />
guard out into the twilight.</p>
<p>"Probably not," Cain said to Ilandra once they were outside.<br />
"They day after tomorrow he will doubtless lead a charge against who<br />
knows many enemy soldiers.  I&#039;m sure sleeping arrangements are the<br />
last thing on his mind."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Oh OK. By the way, what did you do with the little box I gave you?" she asked. "It is completely safe, right?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"It&#039;s in Hawthorn&#039;s saddlebags," said Cain.  "I&#039;m sure the old boy<br />
won&#039;t let anyone take it.  I&#039;ll fetch it once we get to... oh."</p>
<p>Where the guard and the two following him had expected to find a tent,<br />
there was instead a pile of bags, poles and miscellaneous weaponry.</p>
<p>"Ah," said the guard, turning to address Ilandra and Cain.  "Must still be on fortification duty.  Not to worry."</p>
<p>He pointed at the first two ordinary soldiers to walk past.</p>
<p>"You two!"</p>
<p>"Sir?"</p>
<p>"You, go find Cap Jameson.  Should be on the north-east<br />
ditch.  Tell him he&#039;s bunking with the Lieutenants tonight,<br />
Richtoven&#039;s orders.  You, get the rest of your squad together,<br />
take a tent from the pile and put it up where I&#039;m standing.<br />
Understood?"</p>
<p>"Yes sir!" they both shouted, saluting, before rushing off about their duties.</p>
<p>"Shouldn&#039;t have to keep you waiting too long," said the guard to<br />
Ilandra and Cain.  "If you wanted to fetch your things from your<br />
horse, now would probably be the time.  I can take you there, if<br />
you like."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra blushed a little.</p>
<p>"That would be splendid, thank you!" she said. "Besides, I&#039;ll feel a little bad if we don&#039;t at least check he&#039;s alright."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The three of them made their way across the camp to an area set apart<br />
from the tents.  Here, hefty wooden stakes had been hammered into<br />
the ground, and from each one six or seven ropes tethered the same<br />
number of horses to the spot.  This makeshift stable stretched for<br />
hundreds of yards and uncountably many horses.</p>
<p>They had to ask one of the stable hands in the end, and were eventually<br />
led to where Hawthorn stood munching grass next to a group of much less<br />
intelligent-looking horses.  He looked up and snorted as Cain and<br />
Ilandra approached.</p>
<p>Cain made a deliberate act of putting his hand on the horse&#039;s side as<br />
he unpacked the bags, telling him silently what their plans were.</p>
<p>"It&#039;s still here," said Cain out loud, having found the box.  "Should we take it with us?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Yes." Ilandra said, looking slightly panicky at the sheer number of<br />
horses nearby. "I&#039;d feel a lot happier knowing you have it with you at<br />
all times... not that I don&#039;t trust Hawthorn..."</p>
<p>She gave the other horses a nervous look.</p>
<p>"Cain, could we go soon? The other death machines look like they might<br />
trample me..." she said, her voice shaking in fear. She practically ran<br />
over to Hawthorn, then upon reaching him she stroked his neck. "Sorry,<br />
just they&#039;re huge... and you already promised you wouldn&#039;t tread on<br />
me..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I understand," said Hawthorn in his strange voice-in-your-head way.</p>
<p>The three of them made their way back across camp, Cain and the guard<br />
carrying the majority of the baggage.  Cain kept the box, still<br />
unopened, in his pocket.</p>
<p>By the time they had reached their original spot, a tent had been<br />
erected and was glowing by candlelight from the inside.  The<br />
soldier that had originally been given the task stood in front of it.</p>
<p>"Permission to return to work, sir?" he asked the guard, as the three arrived.</p>
<p>"Granted."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir!"</p>
<p>The guard stepped inside the tent first, putting his share of the<br />
equipment down carefully in one corner.  Once Cain and Ilandra<br />
were inside and similarly offloaded, he turned to speak to them.</p>
<p>"I should return to my post now," he said.  "As the General said,<br />
you are welcome in his tent should you find yourselves with nothing to<br />
do.  If you find me still on duty, I would be happy to introduce<br />
you to anyone else with whom you wish to speak.  Is there anything<br />
else you wish me to help you with before I leave?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"No, thank you so much for all your help though!" she said, bobbing<br />
slightly in a curtsey. "I think we&#039;ll stick around here for a while<br />
though... unless Cain wants to do anything?"</p>
<p>She looked up at him for direction.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Weariness had begun to show clearly in Cain&#039;s eyes from the moment they stepped inside the tent.</p>
<p>"No," he said with a sigh.  "Not particularly.  When was the<br />
last time we had a good night&#039;s sleep?"  He thought.  "About<br />
six weeks ago for me, I think."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"A good night&#039;s sleep?" she said, thoughtfully. "About two years ago,<br />
before your mother announced that you were all going off on a big<br />
expedition..."</p>
<p>Seeing the look of guilt on his face she smiled.</p>
<p>"Seriously, I slept pretty well the other night..." she told him more seriously. "but you need sleep so I&#039;ll stay with you."</p>
