<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>A little after noon, Akane set out from Castle Poppy towards the North<br />
and the West.  With her rode five Poppy soldiers, sent to guard<br />
the road as it passed into the contested Hyacinth lands, together with<br />
a cartload of wood and tools from which to construct a watchtower.</p>
<p>For the most part the soldiers rode in silence.  It had been two<br />
years since they had last travelled this route, and that time was not<br />
one that they remembered fondly.  Towards mid-afternoon, they<br />
reached an area where the valley broadened somewhat before it rose up<br />
into the hills.  The men stopped here for a while, their reason<br />
perfectly clear although it was never uttered.</p>
<p>Two years ago, this was where House Poppy made its final stand against<br />
the invading Whites.  It was here that Duke Arnell fell, and it<br />
was this field from which only one in every twenty of House Poppy<br />
emerged alive.</p>
<p>Though they stopped to remember they did not linger, and before very<br />
long they continued their melancholy way through the last of the valley<br />
and up into the hills that formed the natural border between the two<br />
duchies.</p>
<p>It was early evening by the time they crested the largest hill they had<br />
so far encountered.  The road had risen straight up it, and it<br />
continued straight down into a wide, forested bowl of a valley.<br />
Beyond that, the snowy south-eastern peaks of a mountain range rose<br />
sharply through wispy clouds.</p>
<p>Though it had threatened to rain for most of the afternoon, they had<br />
mercifully avoided the bad weather, and the ground of the hill was<br />
still dry.  The soldiers began to unpack, ready to spend the night<br />
there, for this was as far as the Poppies&#039; small territory extended.</p>
<p>Akane, with the faun&#039;s vague directions and descriptions of his family<br />
in her mind, bade the soldiers farewell and stepped forward into...</p>
<p>THUMP.</p>
<p>The world jarred, flashing a dark and pure white as space and time<br />
seemed to rearrange themselves for the brief second that Akane stepped<br />
over the border into Hyacinth kingdom.  The shock shut down her<br />
body and brain, leaving her twitching on the floor, switching forms<br />
back and forth with each rapid blink of her eyes.</p>
<p>When Akane gained control of herself again, she found herself sprawled<br />
on the grass a dozen or so yards beyond the line that marked the change<br />
of ownership.  Back on the other side of that invisible but<br />
somehow obvious - and, it seemed, somehow defended - line, the Poppy<br />
soldiers stood on alert.  Not a single one of them seemed to have<br />
dared get within touching distance of the border once they&#039;d seen what<br />
happened to Akane.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane nodded to the soldiers across the border. "I should be back in at<br />
least a few days," she said, not shouting across the intervening space<br />
but nevertheless hoping her voice carried. "If it takes me over a week,<br />
let the Duchess know that something may have gone wrong. It should<br />
probably take much less time, though," she nodded to them.</p>
<p>She pulled out Albert&#039;s watch and held it between her teeth. As she<br />
shifted into fox form, her clothes dissolving into red fur, the<br />
metallic taste became sharper. As her jaw elongated it concealed the<br />
heirloom, so it wasn&#039;t obvious that there was anything unusual about<br />
this particular animal. She began to head off in the direction the faun<br />
had indicated his village should be, moving carefully through the<br />
hills, hiding in the shadows of trees or bushes to make sure her<br />
passage was as hidden as possible - all in all, typical fox<br />
behaviour....</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As Akane rushed on down into the forested valley, evening rolled in,<br />
and with it a thick mist.  It hung in amongst the trees, drifting<br />
lazily about on the barely detectable zephyrs.  By the time the<br />
sun had properly sunk and the world was noticeably dimmed, Akane&#039;s<br />
sense of smell picked up something ahead.  It was a sweet smell,<br />
but not the sweetness of flower pollen or rotting leaves.</p>
<p>Before long, she reached the source of the smell - a cottage, standing<br />
alone in a small clearing.  It loomed up precipitously over her<br />
fox-form, blurred and dark against the purple sky, and reeking ever<br />
more strongly of a smell not normally encountered in a forest.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane raised her snout and sniffed the air. She could mainly only taste metal, but the smell was very familiar. <i>Gingerbread,<br />
yum. Figures that particular fairy tale made its way here, somewhere.<br />
I&#039;d be curious as to what form it&#039;s chosen to take, but...</i> There was something more to the scent; she sniffed again. <i><b>Ilandra?!</b></i><br />
Her nose led her to a puddle of what was definitely vomit on the ground<br />
near by, and from there the trail led... *sniff, sniff* in the<br />
direction she was going.</p>
<p><i>Oh, dear,</i> she thought. <i>I sincerely hope Ilandra doesn&#039;t feel<br />
I&#039;m trying to ruin her vacation, but I made a promise to Albert and I<br />
mean to keep it. If necessary I suppose I&#039;ll have to shift back to<br />
human and explain myself, but that will definitely put a damper on my<br />
cover story of "just a nice, harmless woodland animal". Bugger,</i> she<br />
thought, and proceeded even more cautiously, keeping her mind on both<br />
her cousin&#039;s trail and her own destination, in case they happened to<br />
diverge.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As Akane left the cottage&#039;s clearing and continued parallel to the<br />
road, another scent briefly took over - a smell musty and old, almost<br />
indistinguishable from the forest itself, but somehow... just slightly<br />
more fae.</p>
<p><font color="red">OC: There&#039;s a hook, feel free to bite or not.</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p><i>((Oh, alright, since you want me to take the hook so badly :P))</i></p>
<p>Akane sighed. She had her priorities, but her curiosity was digging<br />
like a sharp knife. She didn&#039;t think whatever she found here would be<br />
relevant towards her current mission, and was probably bad news, and<br />
moreover the scent of Ilandra hung tantalizingly in the air, suggesting<br />
that she might be able to both retrieve Albert&#039;s family and make sure<br />
her own was doing alright - albeit from a distance - but...</p>
<p><i>It&#039;s a gingerbread house. You know you want to,</i> she sighed to herself. <i>Yummy and domestic. Pure genius!</i> It might not hurt to investigate. Maybe she&#039;d even find out something useful.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>As Akane paused, she heard a rustling sound away to her left, the<br />
direction of the smell.  Something was moving - something small,<br />
something quiet.  It was making little enough noise that a normal<br />
person would have barely been able to make it out over the faint<br />
murmuring of the trees overhead.</p>
<p>Slowly, subtly, it was coming closer.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane quickly backed up into the nearest clump of bushes, facing the<br />
direction the noise was coming from. The leaves hid her, but through<br />
them, she had a clear view of the area where the creature would emerge.<br />
She crouched down low to make herself as invisible as possible, ready<br />
to spring or run away should either be required.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The rustling came closer, closer, closer still until Akane realised<br />
that whatever was making the noise must be in the bush directly<br />
opposite her!  And, just as she thought this, two beady eyes shone<br />
through the leaves of the bush, close to the ground, and flicked from<br />
side to side.</p>
<p>Whatever it was stopped moving, and waited.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p><i>It knows I&#039;m here,</i> she realised. <i>It&#039;s...waiting for me to make the first move?</i> she guessed. <i>Let&#039;s give it a little longer before we reveal the secret of the Amazing Talking Fox, even if odds are that it already knows.</i> She gazed intently at the creature, trying to see it more clearly, hind paws still at the ready to attack or run.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>After a minute or so, the mysterious eyes narrowed, suggestive of a scowl.</p>
<p>"Right then!" came the loud voice of what sounded to be a very old woman.  "I know you&#039;re there, and I&#039;m coming for you!"</p>
<p>The branches parted, shoved aside by a walking cane, and the witch<br />
stepped out.  She was unmistakably a witch - she stood three feet<br />
tall at most in her hunched form, with a tattered hat and threadbare<br />
black cloak, with that "I&#039;m in charge, and now I&#039;m angry" look on her<br />
face.</p>
<p>"I can smell you," she cackled, "and you smell <i>tasty</i>!"</p>
<p>She gripped her stick tightly, and swung it at the very top branches of<br />
the bush in which Akane was hiding.  A couple of green leaves<br />
rained down inside the bush...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p><i>Shitshitshit,</i> thought Akane, <i>Looks like the house&#039;s occupant took her form from the legend, or vice versa, after all.</i></p>
<p>She sprang backwards, putting distance between herself and the witch,<br />
and responded, "No, I&#039;d probably make a horrible meal. Look at me, I&#039;m<br />
tiny and covered with fur. Barely good for an appetizer, hardly worth<br />
the time to skin and cook. I mean you no harm as long as you leave me<br />
be, although I&#039;d appreciate it if you&#039;d be willing to exchange<br />
information with me."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The old witch&#039;s face looked triumphant as she saw the fox emerge, but quickly returned to a scowl once Akane spoke.</p>
<p>"Ah, so it thinks and it speaks," she said.  "Well, that&#039;s never<br />
been a worry of mine before!  Now just what do you mean by<br />
&#039;information&#039;, and answer quickly!  I&#039;m hungry, and I&#039;m thinking<br />
you might be worth the effort after all!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;d like to know about anything strange that might have been going on<br />
in these lands recently - more unrest than usual amongst the common<br />
folk, for example. I&#039;d also like to know anything you may have noticed<br />
about two travelers that passed by here recently - a young woman and<br />
man.<br />
"I will answer questions of your own in return, if there&#039;s anything<br />
you&#039;d like to know. I can tell you something about the doings of the<br />
neighboring nobles; you&#039;d be amazed how freely their people will speak<br />
in front of a harmless woodland animal. I can also tell you something<br />
of the human world, if you&#039;re interested - I know a bit about it. I&#039;m<br />
the fox from &#039;The Little Prince&#039;," she said proudly, hoping it was<br />
plausible. Who was to say how much of that legend might have gone into<br />
shaping her own life, after all? <i>"Voici<br />
mon secret. Il est trËs simple: on ne voit bien qu&#039;avec le c&#339;ur.<br />
L&#039;essentiel est invisible pour les yeux." If only I had seen clearly<br />
sooner....</i><br />
"Or anything else I can help you with, besides providing dinner," she<br />
finished hopefully. "I&#039;d really hate for this meeting to get<br />
unpleasant; the war has left so few of us..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well well well," said the witch, twirling her stick in her<br />
hands.  "I didn&#039;t catch any of that gobbledegook of yours, but<br />
let&#039;s see now.  You&#039;ll tell me everything you know about the state<br />
of the war, and I&#039;ll tell you what I know about travellers passing by<br />
here.  Won&#039;t you come inside, though, it&#039;s getting dark and damp<br />
out here."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane cocked her head and looked at the witch. Her offer seemed to be<br />
honest, but the protection of custom couldn&#039;t hurt. "For the shelter of<br />
your home, I thank you," she said. "By the oath of bread and salt I<br />
swear in Danu&#039;s name that I shall remain under your roof in peace and<br />
do no harm to you and yours as long as they offer me none in return;<br />
and as is ever the traveler&#039;s duty towards his host, I will share with<br />
you such news as I know unless it would be a secret that betray my<br />
House and kin," she said, invoking Faerie laws that protected both<br />
guest and host for the duration of her visit.</p>
<p>It was a noble&#039;s oath, one that came from the Sidhe side of her family<br />
although she had mainly taken after her mother, and as such it revealed<br />
a fair bit about her right there; but guests were, amongst other<br />
things, honest, and the witch would be as bound by the laws of<br />
hospitality to do her using no harm with the information as Akane<br />
herself would be.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"My, you&#039;re a bit untrusting, aren&#039;t you?  Nevertheless, my offer is genuine.  I&#039;m not going to eat you."</p>
<p>The witch led the way back to the gingerbread cottage, sat herself down<br />
at the kitchen table, and gestured towards the other somewhat<br />
sticky-looking chair.  "Will you have a seat, or will you be<br />
staying down there?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane grinned a toothy vulpine grin. "Thanks, I prefer being a bit<br />
taller when I can afford it," she said, stretching smoothly into her<br />
human form, spitting out Albert&#039;s watch, which was much more unwieldy<br />
to talk around with a human mouth, and placing it securely in an inside<br />
pocket of her coat.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m afraid the warnings I was given before setting out into these<br />
lands didn&#039;t give me much reason to be trusting. I hear the war<br />
devastated this area more than others, and it&#039;s pretty much anarchy. I<br />
also think I&#039;d make a horrible roast," she continued, grinning, as she<br />
sat on the sticky chair. <i>The coat will wash,</i> she thought. "Tell me what you already know about the war, and I&#039;ll fill in any gaps I can."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Now I keep myself to myself," said the witch, pulling her shawl closer<br />
around her.  "So I wouldn&#039;t know very much, save for the fact that<br />
about two years ago an army came though here, killed a lot of people,<br />
and then this last week another army came through - the other direction<br />
this time - and did the exact same.</p>
<p>So then, do fill me in on the rest, won&#039;t you?  What exactly is going on here?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane&#039;s eyebrows rose in surprise, although she was able to prevent herself from gaping. <i>So<br />
it&#039;s true, it&#039;s possible that fae outside the noble classes haven&#039;t<br />
even found out what the war was about in the first place! No wonder<br />
they resent us all...</i> And with that realisation she understood<br />
that, although she might not fully trust the old woman, all those who<br />
had lost something to the war deserved some kind of explanation.</p>
<p>"It started when the King and Queen disappeared," she said quietly.<br />
"Nobody is sure exactly how. House Red Rose and House White Rose began<br />
to squabble over the succession, each bringing up more and more obscure<br />
claims of common ancestry or intermarriage with the royal pair. Of<br />
course, they couldn&#039;t agree on whose claim was better, even if they<br />
hadn&#039;t been more or less evenly matched, so they started fighting over<br />
it. It was terrible, but even that was a stalemate, with the support of<br />
the greater and lesser Houses also split quite evenly."</p>
<p>She shrugged. "It&#039;s gotten a bit quieter now, mostly because the Reds<br />
and the Whites are the only ones who still feel strongly about it; the<br />
rest of us have lost too much. My own kin were almost wiped out. We<br />
also think there may be other interests coming into play, but we can<br />
barely begin to venture a guess as to who that might be and what<br />
they&#039;re really after," she said, giving the old woman the gist of the<br />
information and carefully omitting those details that might be used<br />
against the Honeysuckles or the Poppies.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Seems like the fighting&#039;s still going on here though," the witch<br />
said.  "Have the Hyacinths got any of these &#039;other interests&#039;?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;ve heard a rumor that they might be considering pulling out of the<br />
war," Akane nodded, "But as far as I know they&#039;ve made no move to<br />
actually do so. I was told, though, that a lot of the violence being<br />
done on these lands is at the hands of common folk who are hungry and<br />
desperate," she sighed. "As I hear it, it wasn&#039;t necessarily soldiers<br />
that I needed to be wary of whilst here. I can sympathise, much as I<br />
prefer my own skin intact. It&#039;s why I was so wary of you, although<br />
certainly the comments about eating me didn&#039;t put me at ease either."</p>
<p><i>((OOC: If memory serves Prince Theodore the poncy Chrysanthemum mentioned the Hyacinths? If not, I&#039;ll edit.))</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Yes," said the witch, "I dare say the common folk - well, the <i>normal</i><br />
common folk at least - must be enduring quite a lot of late.<br />
Hungry, desperate, yes.  I&#039;ll have to see what I can do.<br />
Now, what was it you were wanting to know?  Do forgive me, I&#039;ve a<br />
terrible memory for things like that."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"The normal common folk?" Akane asked. "As opposed to? Is there<br />
something they can do to keep the war from impacting their lives as<br />
badly? If there is, I&#039;d like to know...maybe I can help," she added.<br />
"As for my request: I&#039;m following a young woman and a young man that<br />
should&#039;ve passed this way not too long ago. I don&#039;t mean them any harm;<br />
I want to know if they&#039;re well," she said, and more of her concern<br />
leaked into her tone than she had intended. "I&#039;d like to know about<br />
what lies in the direction they&#039;re headed, and if they&#039;re likely to<br />
come to any harm."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"As opposed to witches, and our kind," she replied.  "We have our<br />
ways of getting by, even when the less fortunate suffer and starve.</p>
<p>"Now, as to your friends.  They did indeed pass by this way, on a<br />
horse, maybe six hours ago.  They probably got to the village of<br />
Wheat Down, further along the road where the valley opens out, about<br />
mid-afternoon.  What they did after that, I couldn&#039;t possibly say."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p><i>Wheat Down,</i> her mind confirmed. <i>Albert&#039;s family are supposed to live quite near there, aren&#039;t they?</i> So she asked. "Would you happen to know anything about where I might find a family of fauns that live quite near Wheat Down?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"No, I&#039;m afraid not.  I don&#039;t recall having seen a faun in recent times, and I&#039;m sure I would have remembered one..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane nodded. "Well, thank you very much for the information and the<br />
hospitality; I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll find the people I&#039;m looking for. I&#039;m afraid<br />
I must get going, as I have business to take care of, but if you need<br />
to find me in future or wish to trade information again, ask for me at<br />
the Hospital over the border; they&#039;ll be able to get in touch with me,"<br />
she said, diplomatically offering the witch a way to contact her that<br />
would grant her safe passage without revealing her identity to such a<br />
degree that it would diplomatically jeopardise either the Honeysuckles<br />
or the Poppies. "I hope things get better here, for you and for the<br />
other folk as well. May peace be upon us all, hopefully sooner rather<br />
than later," she finished.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I&#039;m sure they will, for us and for them.  I&#039;m sure they will,"<br />
said the witch.  "Now keep your wits about you, for there&#039;s<br />
dangerous men that walk these roads," she said, shutting her<br />
gingerbread front door behind her.</p>
<p>A chill hung in the air now, mixed with the fog, as if the winter had<br />
not quite given up April to its warmer brother just yet.  The road<br />
back and the road forward both looked equally cold and<br />
uninviting.  But, somewhere ahead lay Wheat Down, and possibly<br />
Ilandra and Albert&#039;s family too...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>The mist was chilly, and possibly a little eerie. It drew Akane&#039;s mind<br />
back to when she had lived in London at the turn of the century, of the<br />
fog hovering low over the river like a ghost. It had certainly been a <i>unique</i><br />
time, though she hadn&#039;t regretted her decision to flee over the ocean<br />
before the bombs began to fall. Neither human nor fae, it seemed, was<br />
ever safe from the aftermath of war.</p>
<p>She rested her hand momentarily over the comforting weight of Albert&#039;s<br />
watch, fingers splayed over it as if to touch something more<br />
substantial than the wraithlike mist. With a sigh, she released it and<br />
began to shift, muscles moving and bones rearranging. As if by magic?<br />
It <i>was</i><br />
magic, and Akane was sure she could not spend another century in the<br />
human world forsaking all contact with Faerie. She&#039;d allowed the<br />
awareness of magic to sink to the back of her mind, although never<br />
leave it entirely - it was necessary, to live in a world where others<br />
aged and she did not - but she had to acknowledge, now, that it was a<br />
part of her heritage.</p>
<p>As was Ilandra. As was her House&#039;s legacy of compassion to those whom<br />
circumstances had irrevocably wronged. She would check on her cousin,<br />
and retrieve Albert&#039;s family, and hopefully all without running into<br />
the kind of men that the witch had warned her about.  She sniffed<br />
the air and trotted back to the fading trail, Cain&#039;s scent and a<br />
distinctive horsey tang and more than anything else, Ilandra, and began<br />
to head follow it, alert to where it might deviate from the way Albert<br />
had described and from the Road to Wheat Down, small red shadow making<br />
its way through the misty forest...</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>It was barely fifteen minutes of her fast fox-pace later that the<br />
smells on the road changed.  No longer was it just Ilandra, Cain<br />
and a horse, but lots of other scents joined in as well.  All fae,<br />
but the rougher scent of a peasant rather than the has-regular-baths<br />
scent of a noble.  All male too, probably six in number.</p>
<p>The two nobles and the peasants continued together for a short way,<br />
before the peasants began to break out of what had been a close<br />
formation - two scouting ahead, whilst two hung back and two stayed<br />
with Ilandra and Cain.  Talking?  Guarding?</p>
<p>Once the men had spread out sufficiently, they continued in this manner into the distance.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane&#039;s breath caught in her vulpine throat, a very human mannerism; a<br />
century walking on two legs had imparted her with a greater affinity<br />
for the humanoid form, although once she had thought of herself as<br />
simply a fox, regardless of the body.</p>
<p>Immediately, her mind began to go through possible scenarios. <i>Common folk found them; this is a given. They are now traveling together. Possibility the first: they were captured,</i> she considered, stomach plummeting until she realised that she didn&#039;t scent the acrid musk of fear.</p>
<p><i>Possibility the second: I&#039;m once again making the mistake of not<br />
giving Ilandra, and Cain, enough credit - the same thing that led to<br />
our fight in the hallway,</i> she admonished herself, and this time the lump in her throat was born out of something entirely different from fear.</p>
<p><i>If they went into the wartorn territories, they must have had a<br />
plan. Even if nobody warned them specifically about the dangers here,<br />
because no-one else knew that they were going, let alone where, I&#039;m<br />
sure they must have realised that to be noble is a contentious thing<br />
these days, even if they&#039;re not aware that they strayed into what is<br />
nominally White Rose land. So they&#039;ll have a story. I don&#039;t know what<br />
it is, so I can&#039;t barge in after them; but I also don&#039;t know if these<br />
others bought it. So I have to check up on them, even if their trail<br />
diverges from my path -</i> she  hoped it didn&#039;t, but this took priority.</p>
<p><i>So, follow. Hopefully they&#039;ll end up near Albert&#039;s family, although<br />
that might complicate matters. Reconaissance. If they&#039;re prisoners,<br />
under guard, I should be able to tell and spring them. If not, then one<br />
of them will likely be able to slip away and talk with me,</i> she<br />
thought, and quickened her pace, moving to track the trail from the<br />
side of the road, undercover, paying careful attention to discern<br />
Ilandra&#039;s and Cain&#039;s distinctive scents from amidst the others.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>It was almost an hour later, with the world now lit only by the tiny<br />
sliver of a moon, by the time Akane reached the point where the trees<br />
started to thin out.  Then, before very long at all had passed,<br />
there were no more trees - just a short gap of bare grass before the<br />
tentative beginnings of a village.</p>
<p>The first building, a good fifty yards from any other, was a low and<br />
non-descript thatched affair.  However, unlike many of the houses<br />
in the village beyond, it was at least intact.  In front of it<br />
lounged two men, sharing a bottle and glancing up at the road through<br />
the forest in the manner of those who are supposed to be keeping a<br />
constant watch on something very uninteresting.</p>
<p>Beyond them, in the village proper, the only lights that burned were in<br />
the largest building of all - likely, an inn.  The rest was lit<br />
only by the moon.</p>

<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane slunk over to the side of the inn building and began to sniff<br />
underneath each window. She called to her mind the raw, earthy scent<br />
that Albert had exuded, strong enough for even her human nose to detect<br />
it, and her cousin&#039;s scent, which she could never forget, and tried to<br />
figure out if either of those scents was lingering here. She could<br />
smell Ilandra quite strongly, so if she followed her nose, she should<br />
find them eventually...</p>
<p><i>((Sorry about incoherency, tired. Next post from kitchen tomorrow!))</i></p>

<p>The earthy scent was everywhere here - not specifically Albert&#039;s smell,<br />
just the smell of the unwashed peasantry.  Akane&#039;s sensitive nose<br />
picked out the separate smells one by one, teasing the tendrils of<br />
scent apart until each one seemed distinct.  Peasants, yes.<br />
Fauns... no.  Not lately, anyway.  And, beneath them, the<br />
unmistakable smells of Ilandra and Cain.</p>
<p>Snuffling around the deserted road through the centre of the village,<br />
it took Akane a while to determine which ways the nobles had<br />
walked.  After a while it became apparent that they had visited<br />
three separate buildings - a reasonably intact cottage in the centre of<br />
the village, one of the run-down shed-like houses on the outskirts and,<br />
most recently, the inn.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane snuck towards the inn&#039;s windows, avoiding the shafts of light<br />
that pooled out from them, and stuck her nose into the windows to get a<br />
better look. She kept an eye on the door, too. If Ilandra and Cain were<br />
inside she couldn&#039;t approach them either as fox or human without<br />
attracting suspicion, so she planned to wait till they were alone...</p>
<p><i>((Guys, wanna arrange some convenient synchronicity? :P))</i></p>

<p>Peering through the front windows and through the slightly ajar door,<br />
Akane could see sights most appropriate to the sounds of drunken<br />
revelry she had been hearing for a while.  Villagers in varying<br />
states of drunkenness and dirtiness ate, drank and danced with<br />
enthusiasm.  Amongst them, however, there was no sign of her<br />
cousin.</p>
<p>Akane made her way around to the back of the inn.  The kitchen<br />
door stood wide open, and just inside the doorway stood two<br />
amply-proportioned women attempting to talk, smoke and drink all at the<br />
same time.  To the fox that paused briefly outside the door, they<br />
paid no regard.</p>
<p>Further around the back a single window was lit.  Inside, talking in hushed tones, were Ilandra and Cain.</p>
