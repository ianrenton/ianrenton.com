<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Nyano strode from Abel&#039;s room to the main banquet hall; a raccoon on a<br />
mission with no time to spare.  Thus, he looked somewhat<br />
disheartened to find that she wasn&#039;t there.  After briefly<br />
scanning the room, Nyano headed across the floor - liberating chocolate<br />
ice cream in the process - and headed out of the opposite door.</p>
<p>As he reached the top of the stairs near Regara&#039;s room, Nyano encountered the lady herself heading his way.</p>
<p>"Ah, Nyano, I&#039;m glad you&#039;re here," she said.  "Everything is going okay, I trust?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano looks relieved to find his quarry, and then finally he lets go of<br />
his tightly held compusure and sinks to the floor in a stressed out<br />
heap.</p>
<p>"Everything&#039;s not ok! Some idiot tried to poison the party, he sneaked<br />
into the kitchens and dosed a lot of the food with what he thought was<br />
poison. It turns out that someone made a mistake, and it&#039;s not poison,<br />
but all the guests think they&#039;ve been poisoned, and house honeysuckle<br />
saved them.</p>
<p>Abel and I have got him locked up in the tower of paranoia. Some noble<br />
called Indigo used sovereign to order him to poison the party and gave<br />
him a plan that virtually guaranteed that he&#039;d get caught. Apparently<br />
he&#039;s was offered enough money to feed his starving family, and has a<br />
grudge against the reds anyway, so he wasn&#039;t unwilling to do it. I<br />
think it&#039;s all just a plan by the whites to poison a bunch of red<br />
nobles, but Akane is convinced it has something to do with the black<br />
rose comittee for no good reason. We had a huge argument about what was<br />
going to happen to him, and now I&#039;ve finally found you to sort it out.</p>
<p>I think you should give him a trial immediately and in public. We can<br />
repeat the questioning we gave him in private, he&#039;s already confessed<br />
to me, Abel, Akane and Hugh. He still thinks he successfully poisoned<br />
everybody. So it&#039;s a pretty straightforward case. I think he has to be<br />
sentenced to death to appease the visiting nobles, but he only did this<br />
because he was Commanded to, and he wouldn&#039;t have been in such a bad<br />
situation if his liege hadn&#039;t abandoned him, it&#039;s not fair to kill him.</p>
<p>I&#039;m willing to offer to take him and his family on as indentured<br />
servants if that would be possible. He&#039;s scared to death of me, so<br />
it&#039;ll look like a fitting punishment. Akane wants to offer his family a<br />
place in the house honeysuckle hospital as healers, but I really don&#039;t<br />
think that&#039;s a good idea. What if they turn her down? They&#039;ll have even<br />
more of a grudge against us, and there&#039;s this damn Indigo person<br />
floating about who could use the pathos of the situation to do really<br />
nasty stuff to us, AND she&#039;d be splitting the family up, since he can&#039;t<br />
very well go and be a healer after this.</p>
<p>I don&#039;t know what to do anymore, I&#039;ve sorted the situation out for the minute, but I really needs your help now."</p>
<p>Nyano looks down at the floor at this, his shoulders slumped in exhaustion.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Wait," said Regara, her own stress for a moment superseding<br />
alarm.  "Let&#039;s start from the beginning of that again.  The<br />
guests have been poisoned, but not with actual poison, and they were<br />
&#039;cured&#039; by House Honeysuckle?  What is this, a Honeysuckle<br />
publicity stunt?  What&#039;s happened to the guests, are they all<br />
still here?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"There was some sort of mixup with the poison. The bottle marked as<br />
poisonous didn&#039;t actually have any poison in it. When we questioned it,<br />
it mumbled something about another bottle that was supposed to be used<br />
to poison a party full of people.</p>
<p>I don&#039;t know quite what happened with the guests since I was<br />
restraining the poisoner, but when I got to the main hall house<br />
honeysuckle were dispensing &#039;antidote&#039; and the guests seemed to be<br />
happy to take it. Gustaffsen and I had checked the bottle and<br />
discovered that it had no poison in it, so I assumed someone had<br />
started dispensing antidotes to the guests before we finished our<br />
analysis.</p>
<p>The guests were all there and looking fine when I last saw them. I<br />
think Cain and Illandra are looking after them, but it would probably<br />
help if you were there. I&#039;m sure the guests have been told that someone<br />
tried to poison them."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Right," said Regara.  "We&#039;re going to the Hall right now.<br />
The guests are our top priority, so long as your prisoner is secure we<br />
can deal with him later."</p>
<p>Regara stomped down to the banquet hall with Nyano in tow.  Her<br />
explosive entrance drew rather too many peoples&#039; attentions, but it was<br />
immediately clear to the Duchess that the party was still underway - no<br />
great number of people had left, and there was still an air of<br />
celebration and inebriation.</p>
<p>The Duchess stood in front of the top table, and bellowed.</p>
<p>"CAIN?  ILANDRA?"</p>
<p>The room was suddenly silent, and the voices of her son and<br />
daughter-in-law-to-be did not answer her.  Regara surveyed the<br />
stunned crowd, and could not see their faces.</p>
<p>Thus, she picked the most likely person to know what the hell was going on.</p>
<p>"ABEL!?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Barely a minute later Abel skidded into the banquet hall, shortly followed by an equally high-speed Akane.</p>
<p>"Ah!  There you are," said Regara.  "Cain and Ilandra were supposed to be looking after the guests; where are they?"</p>
<p>"Last I heard, they said they were going back to Honeysuckle Cottage<br />
for a while," said Abel.  "What&#039;s the problem?  The party<br />
still seems to be going well.  To be honest, what with the<br />
theatrical nature of the exposition and the rapid administering of the<br />
antidote, I suspect that half the party just believed it to be some<br />
form of avant-garde staged event."</p>
<p>Regara looked around the room, then sighed.</p>
<p>"Right," she said, "that I suppose deals with part of the<br />
problem.  Now, Nyano, what did you say about this supposed<br />
poisoner?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"He was caught by the kitchen staff carrying a half empty bottle marked<br />
poison. I interrogated him, and he said his name was Albert and someone<br />
called Indigo something made him do it. Apparently he was going to be<br />
paid enough gold to feed his starving family. Gustaffssen checked the<br />
bottle to see what kind of poison it was, but it turned out not to be<br />
poisoned at all.</p>
<p>So I locked Albert up in the dungeon and came here to find everybody<br />
acting like there was a big poisoning going on. We figured this Indigo<br />
Something was probably trouble, so Abel and Akane and I went to<br />
interrogate the &#039;poison&#039; bottle. It rambled a lot but I got the<br />
impression from what it said that a mistake had been made by Indigo,<br />
who did indeed want to poison the nobles at the party, but had<br />
accidentally issued Albert with a bottle that didn&#039;t actually contain<br />
any poison.</p>
<p>Then Akane wanted to interrogate the prisoner as well, he didn&#039;t really<br />
say anything new, but she promissed to look after him. Then we had an<br />
argument about what should be done with him and his family.</p>
<p>I think he should be tried immediatly to prevent us looking bad to our<br />
guests, since he willingly tried to poison all these people I think<br />
it&#039;s unavoidable that we&#039;re going to have to sentence him to death. I<br />
think that&#039;s unfair, since he&#039;s being manipulated by Indigo, and want<br />
to have his formal death sentence commuted to indentured servitute for<br />
him and his family to me. That way they can continue in the lifestyle<br />
they&#039;re used to, we don&#039;t look weak to our allies, and I can look after<br />
him and his family and prevent Indigo from manipulating them any<br />
further. We could possibly even catch Indigo in a trap if he does try<br />
and contact them.</p>
<p>Akane wants to offer his family a positions as healers of house<br />
honeysuckle. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a good idea, since I doubt all of<br />
them will take her up on her offer, and I suspect that any that don&#039;t<br />
are going to be used by Indigo to attack us, because we&#039;ll either have<br />
killed or imprisoned their father. Not to mention that her plan<br />
involves splitting their family up.</p>
<p>I think that&#039;s everything."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane shook her head. "That&#039;s close to what I had in mind, Your Grace,<br />
but not exactly. I suggested training some members of Albert&#039;s family -<br />
not Albert himself, as it would be understandably difficult to trust<br />
him - as healers, after they have lived on Honeysuckle land for some<br />
time and their loyalty can be trusted.</p>
<p>"I suggested that we be the ones to look after him and his family<br />
because, as we are a neutral house, they cannot resent us for the<br />
actions of either of the two factions in the war; furthermore, because<br />
we lost so many people, we can easily offer them all the land they can<br />
farm, which means they are not likely to go hungry again.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, I believe I have treated Albert in a way which will<br />
ensure that he and his family choose loyalty to House Honeysuckle of<br />
their own free will, and make them unlikely to retaliate against us. I<br />
explained what the two likely outcomes of his trial are, and offered to<br />
request that I receive custody of him and his family if Your Grace<br />
would grant this, and he said that he would like to come with me, if it<br />
is possible.</p>
<p>"Apparently the war has left a lot of peasants starving and angry. If<br />
Albert&#039;s entire family is indentured for a choice that only he made, I<br />
am afraid that will make the populace resentful, whereas if he is<br />
indentured to me and asks his family to come live on our lands as free<br />
commoners, both House Honeysuckle <i>and</i><br />
House Poppy will not be seen as weak, but rather as friends to the<br />
dispossessed, which will make it far more difficult for this Indigo to<br />
find agents amongst them.</p>
<p>"I am willing to go retreive the man&#039;s family myself, should Your Grace<br />
choose to cede their custody to House Honeysuckle, perhaps as a token<br />
of the trust and alliance which exists between us due to the upcoming<br />
marriage between your son and my cousin. I hope you will consider<br />
this," she finished, keeping her tone as respectful and diplomatic as<br />
possible.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Dispossessed...  Resentful...  Hmm," mused Regara.  "I<br />
think I would like to speak to this &#039;Albert&#039; myself.  Where is he<br />
being held?"</p>
<p>"Er... He&#039;s in Duke Ignacious&#039; room, at the moment," said Abel.</p>
<p>"In Duke Ign...  Right.  Very well."</p>
<p>Regara clicked her fingers, and the ever-lurking Mister Chicken appeared by her side.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your efforts," she said to the three young nobles.<br />
Then she turned and made for the door, her servant clucking along<br />
before her to open the doors in her way.</p>
<p><font color="red">OC: Do whatever you like - chase Regara, be social<br />
with the guests, disembowel each other with spoons...  Regara will<br />
be back in half an hour.  If you don&#039;t want to do anything of<br />
importance in the meantime, poke me and I&#039;ll continue with Regara&#039;s<br />
return.</font></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane turned to Nyano. "I&#039;d like to apologise for my strong reaction to<br />
your words earlier. If you got the impression that I was planning to<br />
immediately award Albert&#039;s family positions of trust within our House<br />
with no need that they prove their loyalty beforehand, then I&#039;m not<br />
surprised that you found it a stupid idea and told me so. Whilst I&#039;m<br />
sure we still disagree on certain things and probably will again, I<br />
think we also misunderstood each other, and I&#039;m hoping we can put that<br />
aside and work together if we need to do so again in the future," she<br />
said to the Scoutmaster.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano bows politely to Akane.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m the one who should be apologising, I was ruder than you were.<br />
Whatever happens now is up to the Duchess, we should go back to being<br />
friends."</p>
<p>Nyano turns back to Akane as he&#039;s leaving.</p>
<p>"I only argued with you because I like you.  If I didn&#039;t think<br />
your opinion mattered, I wouldn&#039;t have bothered to listen to it!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane grinned at the retreating Nyano. "Just don&#039;t ask me what an<br />
Aardvark is and why I want to drink it, because I couldn&#039;t explain that<br />
if I tried, and I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll have no trouble getting along..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Half an hour passed, and the party had begun to die down<br />
somewhat.  A good proportion of the guests had retired to bed, and<br />
the majority of the remainder were either massively full, very drunk or<br />
both, and thus inclined to do little other than sit or fall over<br />
wherever they happened to be.  Some of the more sober guests were<br />
gathered around one of the large fireplaces, taking it in turns to tell<br />
stories and recite poems.  Across the room, some of the less sober<br />
guests were singing.  They weren&#039;t taking turns.</p>
<p>Into this room walked the now rather tired-looking Duchess Regara, who quickly rounded up Nyano and Akane.</p>
<p>"Right," she said.  "I&#039;ll formally announce this at breakfast<br />
tomorrow, on the off-chance that any of our visitors are awake in time,<br />
so don&#039;t breathe a word of this to anyone.</p>
<p>"There is another threat to the way of things in Arcadia, perhaps more<br />
worrisome than any colour of Rose.  If what I have learned from<br />
Albert is true, it is high time we expended a little more effort in<br />
dealing with the common folk and their ambition.</p>
<p>"Thus, I have decided the following.  Akane, I have no right to<br />
issue you orders, but I believe you wish to retrieve Albert&#039;s family<br />
and bring them under the protection of House Honeysuckle.  This I<br />
will permit you to do, provided I or another Poppy has access to each<br />
member of his family, privately, before they come under your<br />
care.  You are also to tell us anything you find out about the<br />
movement of troops in Hyacinth lands, the general mood of their<br />
peasantry, and any specific information regarding &#039;Indigo&#039;.</p>
<p>"Nyano, we have a great deal of work to do in order that we are to be<br />
respected again by the Reds.  Sending any of our troops into<br />
Hyacinth lands would risk that, along with valuable lives.<br />
However, inform our spies of Indigo and his intentions.  By hook<br />
or by crook we will have him, and we will dispense justice ourselves."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane processed Regara&#039;s words. <i>Another threat, more worrisome than any colour of Rose...</i><br />
"Your Grace, from what Albert told me, Indigo seemed to be a noble, and<br />
therefore I assumed whatever malice he was plotting was unrelated to<br />
the commoners&#039; suffering. What agency is it you fear?</p>
<p>"I will set out to retrieve Albert&#039;s family as soon as I can; I hope<br />
you will will ask your people to share with me any information they may<br />
already have about the state of the Hyacinth lands and the movements of<br />
the troops there, and of course I will let them know whatever I find<br />
out as soon as I return. I understand that it is politically<br />
inadvisable for you to send any troops onto Hyacinth lands with me, but<br />
if you would permit one or two men to wait for me near the border in<br />
case I am followed when I emerge, I would be most grateful for that.</p>
<p>"As the family is to be under my care, I would also appreciate it if<br />
you would tell me as much as you are willing about the questions your<br />
people are to ask them, as it will fall to House Honeysuckle to make<br />
sure that they do not intend any harm to us or our allies whilst under<br />
our care.</p>
<p>"I appreciate your trust, Duchess, and I will do my best for both our Houses," she bowed.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano bowed very low to his liege.</p>
<p>"As you command your grace."</p>
<p>Then he turned and marched out into the castle.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Of course," Regara said to Akane, "It would do no good to send you<br />
unprepared.  Nyano will be speaking to the spies now I believe,<br />
and I will do likewise later tonight.  Tomorrow, either he or I<br />
will tell you everything we know that would be helpful to you.<br />
Regarding the questions I wish to ask his family, that may depend on<br />
the events that unfold when you collect them, and thus you will be told<br />
shortly before the questioning takes place."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>Akane nodded at Regara. "That sounds fair, Your Grace. If they<br />
cooperate, I hope they will be treated courteously, as I would prefer<br />
for them to not begin their service to House Honeysuckle resenting us<br />
or our allies. But all this can certainly wait for tomorrow. I am<br />
grateful to see that tranquillity has reasserted itself at the feast,<br />
and that&#039;s enough for now; I am sorry your homecoming had to suffer the<br />
interruption."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Of course," said Regara.  "And, dear, there is no need for an<br />
apology.  It is not as if the interruptions tonight were of your<br />
causing."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Fifteen minutes or so after he left Nyano returns to the main hall and makes his way to the duchess.</p>
<p>"The message has been sent." he says.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Very well," Regara said to Nyano.  "Thank you.  Now, what<br />
with all the excitement we&#039;ve been having this evening, I believe I<br />
will now be retiring.  Not that I foresee anything else<br />
particularly troublesome occurring, but as always I leave our safety in<br />
your hands."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>Nyano bows to Regara, and then looks across the hall until he catches the eye of one of the guards.</p>
<p>He nods towards Regara twice, and smiles happily when the guard snaps to attention and leaves through a side door.</p>
<p>Safe in the knowledge that as soon as the duchess retires for the night<br />
three guards will be posted at her door. Nyano thinks about returning<br />
to his own rooms for the night, for it was getting quite late, and he<br />
was up way past his bedtime.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Akane</b></p>
<p>"Good night, Your Grace," Akane bowed as Regara retreated. "You too,<br />
Nyano," she added, "I think I&#039;m going to head off to Honeysuckle<br />
Cottage. Regara told me to find you tomorrow morning for a briefing on<br />
the state of the Hyacinth lands, so I&#039;ll see you then," she smiled at<br />
him as she headed off.</p>
<p>She moved out of Castle Poppy as the sounds of flagging revelry faded<br />
behind her, and headed over the rolling hills towards home, until<br />
Honeysuckle Cottage and the hospital were both in view. She headed<br />
towards the latter and found the nurse on night duty, who happened to<br />
be Susie; the nymph looked a bit dishivelled, but was positively<br />
glowing - probably because was accompanied by an even more dishivelled<br />
but equally delighted-looking Duke Willow, and they were heading<br />
towards the office.</p>
<p>"Hey, Susie. Do we have any cases that need looking after?"</p>
<p>"Akane! Welcome back, it&#039;s been so long! I thought I saw you at the feast - what are you <i>doing</i><br />
here at this hour of the night?" the flustered nurse inquired.<br />
"Nevermind, err, I&#039;m sure we can find something for you to do," Susie<br />
grinned. "Nice timing, by the way."</p>
<p>"By all means enjoy yourself," Akane winked. "What have we got?"</p>
<p>"A couple of flu cases in Ward Seven, wear a mask of course, I&#039;m sure<br />
you remember the drill; a farmer who accidentally chopped at his foot<br />
with an axe and the wound went septic in Four who&#039;ll need the bandages<br />
changed and the foot cleaned every few hours, and a few battle<br />
casualties in Two that have been here a while and by now mostly need to<br />
rest, but keep an eye on them anyway. Ooooh!" Susie squealed as Duke<br />
Willow&#039;s hands strayed towards her perfectly-formed backside. "You can<br />
work all night if you like, but I&#039;ll be doing...paperwork in my office<br />
so don&#039;t interrupt!" Susie finished conspiratorially as she was dragged<br />
away.</p>
<p>Akane nodded. "Have someone drop me in a bunk when I pass out," she said, and got to work.</p>
<p><i>((OOC: We&#039;ll pretend Nyano got that in before I edited...hehe))</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>"I guess I&#039;ll see you in the morning then."</p>
<p>Nyano says to Akane before leaving the hall for the last time that night.</p>
