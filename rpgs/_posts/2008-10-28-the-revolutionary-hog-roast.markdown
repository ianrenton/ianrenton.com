<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>By the time the injured had been seen to as best as Ilandra was able,<br />
the sun had already sunk low and threatened to disappear behind the<br />
mountains that rose steeply in the West.  The village blended<br />
deeper into shades of washed-out grey as Ilandra peered around the door<br />
of the makeshift hospital.  No lights were visible in the<br />
ramshackle remains of the houses but the pub, still mostly intact,<br />
shone with a multitude of inner lights.</p>
<p>The rain had abated, although the street was still thick with mud that<br />
threatened to make off with Ilandra and Cain&#039;s shoes as they made their<br />
way towards what sounded very much like the brewings of a party.</p>
<p>They opened the door to what must have been the entire of the village,<br />
or at least what remained of it.  The twenty or so people inside<br />
turned sharply to look at the new arrivals as the orange torchlight<br />
spilled over their faces.  Most looked confused or wary, though<br />
some continued cooking or emptying what casks remained after the<br />
publican&#039;s demise.</p>
<p>After a few short moments that seemed many times longer, Jebodiah<br />
coughed and set his flagon down on the bar with a resounding thump.</p>
<p>"What you&#039;s all lookin&#039; so nervy &#039;bout, you laht?  This &#039;ere&#039;s Kate an&#039; Geral&#039;, them two what Oi told y&#039;all &#039;bout!"</p>
<p>There were some murmured "Ah, roight"s, and the villagers returned to<br />
talking amongst themselves, occasionally looking around to see what the<br />
newcomers would say or do next.</p>
<p>Jebodiah, occupying the only tall stool in the place (which very nearly<br />
made him as tall as anyone sitting on normal chairs), flashed Ilandra<br />
and Cain a smile.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked around, the bar seemed full of people and where there<br />
were people there was cooking. She took a tentative step towards the<br />
bar, then froze as though to test the air, seeing the lack of reaction<br />
she carried on moving towards the bar.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Come &#039;ere, don&#039; be &#039;fraid!" chuckled Jebodiah as he saw Ilandra&#039;s<br />
tentative movement.  He beckoned them closer, then hushed his<br />
voice to a whisper.</p>
<p>"Act&#039;ly, Oi&#039;ve bin meanin&#039; ta have a word wi&#039; ye."  He paused for<br />
a second, and took another swig from his flagon.  "&#039;Ow comes it<br />
ye&#039;re so good wi&#039; th&#039; &#039;erbs?  E&#039;en the ol&#039; witch who lived &#039;a way<br />
away once &#039;pon a while &#039;go, she were ne&#039;er tha&#039;... <i>practical</i>," he said, slowing down for the last word as if it caused him considerable difficulty.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra smiled sweetly. "It&#039;s a secret." she told him. "But if you really wan&#039; to know, I guess Oi&#039;ll tell ya."<br />
He nodded. "I was trained up as a nurse when I was younger, they said<br />
Oi&#039;d be more useful tha&#039; way. Anyways, I &#039;ave a book on it<br />
somewhere..." she continued, then rummaged through her ever-present bag<br />
and pulled out an extremely dog-eared tatty copy of "Herbs and their<br />
uses".<br />
"Gets me through most difficult sitcherashuns." she finished, holding the book the way a small child holds its bear.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Oh, roight y&#039;are," said Jebodiah, the vague memory of "Kate"&#039;s voice<br />
rising several social classes earlier on fading further into the back<br />
of his mind.</p>
<p>"Well&#039;un," he said, "help y&#039;selves ta&#039; food an&#039; drink an&#039; all<br />
that.  Once we&#039;s all gettin&#039; inta&#039; it, Oi&#039;ll make th&#039; &#039;nouncement<br />
&#039;bout ya both."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>After ten minutes or so of the party continuing, with occasional<br />
nervous glances at the silent Ilandra and Cain, Jebodiah stood up to<br />
address the crowd.</p>
<p>"Now&#039;n," he said.  "Looks loike t&#039;hog&#039;s nearly done, but afore we<br />
eat, Oi&#039;d loike ta prop&#039;ly intr&#039;duce these two, bein&#039; Kate an&#039;<br />
Gerald."  He indicated the two newcomers.  "Oi&#039;ve &#039;splained<br />
ta them whoi we&#039;s &#039;ere and what we&#039;s &#039;bout, an&#039; they seem quoite keen<br />
ta&#039; join us.  So, Oi&#039;d loike them ta come for&#039;ard and &#039;splain who<br />
they are, how comes it they&#039;re &#039;ere, how they can &#039;elp us an&#039; &#039;ow we<br />
can &#039;elp them!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra blanched slightly. <i> Right, think fast... you have to have a reason for being here other than the fact you&#039;ve run away with Cain...</i> She swallowed and smoother her skirt out a little.</p>
<p>"Well, we&#039;re on our way ta Honeysuckle lands, we need ta git some<br />
med&#039;cine from there fer our baron&#039;s daugh&#039;er cos she&#039;s dyin&#039;.<br />
Unforch&#039;na&#039;ly, we&#039;re sligh&#039;ly lost... er... we&#039;ll be &#039;elping you wi&#039;<br />
all yer sick and dyin&#039; before movin&#039; on, though." she said in as common<br />
a voice as she could, faintly aware that their cover might have slipped<br />
earlier.</p>
<p><i> Please don&#039;t let anyone ask Cain to speak... please please please don&#039;t let them demand he speak...</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Helpin&#039; us," came the murmur through the crowd.  "Sick an&#039; dyin&#039;..."<br />
"Ya&#039; mean, she can&#039; &#039;eal...?"<br />
"She knows &#039;bout med&#039;cine?"</p>
<p>The murmuring reached talking level, until finally everyone had to shout in a failed attempt to be heard over everyone else.</p>
<p>"Nancy!" shouted a voice from the back of the room, audible over the cacophony.  "Ge&#039; these two &#039;drink!"</p>
<p>A few seconds later, the lady who seemed to pass for a barmaid leaned<br />
over from behind Ilandra and Cain, dropping a foaming cup of ale into<br />
each&#039;s hand.</p>
<p>Jake stepped forward from the back, and revealed the loudest voice to have been his.</p>
<p>"Now&#039;n," he said, quietening the room somewhat.  "Oi pr&#039;pose &#039;toast!  Ta salvation!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>As Nancy put a flagon of ale in Ilandra&#039;s hand, she smiled a thankyou<br />
then looked at the glass looking vaguely greener than usual.</p>
<p>She hoisted the offending item up in a toast before cautiously drinking some ale.</p>
<p><i>ugh, this stuff is just as foul as it smells... how does Abel drink it?</i> She glanced at Cain through the corner of her eye, he was also looking at it nervously. <i>well, it&#039;s not like it&#039;s going to make me too ill, right?</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>The two both nervously sipped their drinks, their inexpert technique<br />
landing them with distinctly frothy noses.  Still, that seemed to<br />
be good enough for the rest of the pub, who returned to shouting and<br />
cheering, not stopping to notice the looks of disgust at the taste on<br />
Ilandra and Cain&#039;s faces.</p>
<p>Jebodiah slowly made his way over to the two of them.</p>
<p>"Well&#039;n," he said, "t&#039;at seemed ta&#039; make th&#039; impress&#039;n we was &#039;opin&#039; for!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra looked into her cup and then at Jebodiah.</p>
<p>"It did?" she asked. "Oh. Erm, &#039;sgood ale..." she smiled weakly.</p>
<p><i> yeuch... this stuff is so gross... i wonder if there&#039;s any juice or something to get rid of the taste...</i></p>
<p>She moved closer to Cain and leaned against him, hoping she might at least get a hug.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain gripped Ilandra around her shoulder, as close as they could get to a hug with drinks in their hands.</p>
<p>"Well&#039;n, don&#039; jus&#039; stan&#039; there like some sorta&#039; hitherto un&#039;nown cit&#039;us<br />
fruit!  T&#039;hog&#039;ll be gettin&#039; cold!" Jebodiah said, gesturing at the<br />
firepit where two women were dishing out carved chunks of meat to<br />
hungry-looking villagers.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Reluctant to incur Jebodiah&#039;s wrath, Ilandra extricated herself from<br />
Cain&#039;s side. Shooting him a look that suggested she&#039;d rather be<br />
cuddled, she moved towards the source of the commotion.</p>
<p>The ladies in the fire pit gave Ilandra bits of hog enclosed in a hunk<br />
of bread. She hadn&#039;t realised how hungry she was, but her body was<br />
letting her know. She barely managed to get to an empty chair before<br />
her knees let her know they wanted her to sit still and eat.</p>
<p><i> mmmm... food... i almost forgot what food tastes like...</i> she thought to herself while munching happily, barely noticing when Cain sat down next to her.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Just as she barely noticed Cain sitting down, she barely noticed Jebodiah coming up behind them either.</p>
<p>"Now no-one&#039;s payin&#039; much &#039;tenshun to ya&#039;...  When you&#039;s done<br />
eatin&#039;, come ta&#039; the back room.  Oi needs ta&#039; talk to ya&#039;."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Startled by the sudden appearances of Cain and Jebodiah, Ilandra<br />
jumped. She only just managed to stop herself changing shape as she<br />
tried to keep hold of her delicious food.</p>
<p>"Jeez, ya couldn&#039;t pu&#039; bells on couldja?" she asked, slightly irritated by the randomly materialising people.</p>
<p>She nodded, and once she&#039;d finished with her sandwich she moved on into the back room with a slightly amused Cain in tow.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Now&#039;n," Jebodiah said once he had shut the door to the back room<br />
behind them.  "I gots some questions for ya&#039;, tha&#039; Oi want ya&#039;<br />
t&#039;answer onistly, w&#039;out t&#039;others list&#039;nin&#039;."</p>
<p>He gestured to four stools that sat on the floor in the centre of the<br />
room, and continued.  "First&#039;a all, where&#039;d tha&#039; horse a&#039; yours<br />
come from?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"The horse?" Ilandra looked perplexed. "Oh that! Er, well, it kinda<br />
belongs to &#039;im." she said, indicating Cain. "&#039;e got given i&#039; ta make<br />
sure our journey weren&#039;t too long."</p>
<p>Panicking inwardly, Ilandra hoped this would wash... after all, there were a lot of peasants and she was a long way from home.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"&#039;s a damn foine &#039;orse, &#039;s what it is," said Jebodiah, turning to Cain.  "Where in all&#039;a faerie d&#039;ya get &#039;im from?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain glanced nervously at Ilandra, who was turning slowly pale.</p>
<p>"I, er...  I mean, Oi, er..." Cain stammered.  Just in time,<br />
he recalled the poppy-flower engravings on the metalwork of the<br />
stirrups, and a story came to mind.</p>
<p><font color="red">Cain rolls to bullshit Jebodiah:<br />
Rolling Charisma (4) + Subterfuge (0) = 4 dice, difficulty 8 (his accent is unconvincing)<br />
0 successes.  Ouch =S</font></p>
<p>"We, uh, I... Oi mean Kate here, whilst we were passing, er, by Cass&#039;le<br />
Poppy, one of their nobles was sick, and Kate... &#039;ealed &#039;im, and, being<br />
as they were... somewot thankful, gave us this &#039;orse."</p>
<p>Jebodiah raised an eyebrow.  He didn&#039;t look convinced.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>She looked at Jebodiah&#039;s face. The story didn&#039;t seem to have washed.</p>
<p><i> well, here&#039;s plan B</i> she thought to herself, preparing for a fuddle.</p>
<p><font color="red">Rolled 4 dice for fuddling, gained three successes... here we go </font></p>
<p>"Everything he has just told you is true" she tells Jebodiah, who<br />
appears to be completely under her control. "Furthermore, he has a very<br />
peasanty voice."</p>
<p><i>Let&#039;s hope this works...</i></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Jebodiah looked confused for a moment, and his normally shining golden eyes glazed over and became dull.</p>
<p>"Oh, Oi&#039;ll say yer&#039; roight there, Mister Gerald," said Jebodiah, not quite his normal gruff self.</p>
<p>"So," he said, turning back to both of them, "how long are ye plannin&#039;<br />
to stay in these parts?  Oi mean, ya&#039; welcome as long as ye loike<br />
- ye can see the &#039;fect yer skill &#039;as on morale &#039;ere.  So, &#039;pendin&#039;<br />
on &#039;ow urgent yer business is..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I don&#039;t know... we&#039;ll probly be stayin&#039; til th&#039; men are &#039;ealthy<br />
&#039;gain." she replied, falling back into her peasant accent. "&#039;less<br />
sommat comes up an&#039; you need extra &#039;elp."</p>
<p>She took hold of Cain&#039;s hand and gave it a squeeze.</p>
<p>"So, why all the &#039;idin&#039; then?" she asked Jebodiah, thinking how odd it<br />
was that they only ever talked behind closed doors and when no-one was<br />
paying attention.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Oi... jus&#039; &#039;ad to make sure&#039;a sommat, an&#039; in case thin&#039;s went badly, I<br />
din&#039;t want the rest ta&#039; hear.  Ya&#039; know what we&#039;s... tryin&#039; ta do<br />
&#039;ere, roight?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"Akchly, no, oi&#039;ve got no idea." she replied.</p>
<p>She really didn&#039;t have the faintest idea what they were trying to do.</p>
<p>"Yer tryin&#039; ta rebuild yer village?" she asked, hopefully.</p>
<p><i>in case things go badly? what have we got ourselves into?</i> she wondered</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, tha&#039;s pretty much it.  I&#039;s jus&#039;, we ain&#039;t relyin&#039; on the<br />
nobles no more.  They never done anythin&#039; fer us, an&#039; now they&#039;ve<br />
gone an&#039; fought their way back an&#039; forth though our land twice, not<br />
carin&#039; a bit for any&#039;a us they moight kill on t&#039;way!  So now, we&#039;s<br />
startin&#039; for ourselves!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"So, you&#039;re gonna try an&#039; break free? Sounds like a bi&#039; of a daft plan,<br />
I mean, oo&#039;s gonna sort out yer major problems? An&#039; keep the law fer<br />
ya?" she asked, perplexed. "An&#039; what&#039;ll ya do ta any nobles tha&#039; come<br />
by?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well, we&#039;s thought &#039;bout that, an&#039; the way we figure it is, why should<br />
some noble who &#039;as no idea &#039;bout our lives make t&#039;laws fer us?<br />
The best people ta decoide what we do, is us!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"But rows about land would ge&#039; really ugly... and some nobles care<br />
abou&#039; their people." Ilandra said. "I know I would if I were a noble!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Well&#039;n, maybe Oi&#039;d vote fer you than.  Sadly fer us folk, we<br />
don&#039;t get ta vote on whose our nobles are, they jus&#039; pick<br />
&#039;emsel&#039;.  An&#039; the kind we &#039;ad &#039;round &#039;ere in all time Oi&#039;ve bin<br />
alive ain&#039;t cared much fer us.  Tha&#039; Duke Hy&#039;cinth, &#039;e switched<br />
sides so many toimes &#039;cordin to &#039;is whim, an he don&#039; care a toiny bit<br />
tha&#039; each toime &#039;e does some army or other start&#039; marchin&#039; on this<br />
place, killin&#039; hones&#039; folk an&#039; destroyin&#039; their loives!"</p>
<p>Jebodiah&#039;s normally bright eyes were shining now, a deep orange bronze,<br />
and his voice had taken on the harsh diction of the truly<br />
empassioned.  "Nobles&#039;re all crap, all they care &#039;bout is<br />
&#039;emselves an&#039; their stupid power games!  An&#039; we can do wi&#039;out &#039;em!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra tentatively put a hand on the old man&#039;s shoulder.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m sure tha&#039; your luck&#039;ll change... and if no&#039; then you c&#039;n come with<br />
us to Honeysuckle lands and they&#039;ll look after you and everyone else<br />
you wanna bring!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Jebodiah glared at Ilandra, and stood, forcing the rather short girl to<br />
remove her hand.  In fact, the previously hunched old man seemed<br />
almost to have grown during his speech.</p>
<p>"Thank ye fer ya&#039; offer, but Oi don&#039; thin&#039; so.  The toime fer<br />
waitin&#039; fer our luck ta&#039; change is over - we&#039;re makin&#039; our own from now<br />
on.  An&#039; without the useless nobility, too.  We farm for &#039;em,<br />
we work for &#039;em, we fight for &#039;em.  It ain&#039;t us tha&#039; needs lookin&#039;<br />
after, it&#039;s them!  An we&#039;ve &#039;ad enough!"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Intimidated, Ilandra jumped behind Cain where she grabbed his shirt and peered around at the now-scary man.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Jebodiah looked nonplussed for a moment.</p>
<p>"Look, Oi, er...  Oi didn&#039;t mean ta scare ya&#039;.  Look, jus&#039;<br />
relax, &#039;joy the party.  Sleep &#039;ere t&#039;noight, think it over.<br />
Maybe we&#039;ll talk some more in t&#039;mornin&#039;, eh?"</p>
<p>The old man flashed a quick smile at Ilandra and Cain, then returned to the party himself.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Once the old man left the room, Ilandra morphed into her cat form and clambered onto Cain&#039;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Once there, she purred at him then clambered into his arms and morphed back.</p>
<p>"Is it just me, or did he get really scary just then?" she asked, snuggling up to his chest.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"He was certainly a bit more... fervent," Cain replied, glad to be able<br />
to drop his hideous attempt at a peasant dialect.  "I wonder if he<br />
realises we&#039;re not who we say we are.  For that matter, I wonder<br />
why he was so interested in the horse..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I don&#039;t know... hopefully the fuddling worked and will hold long<br />
enough for us to stay safe." Ilandra replied. "I can&#039;t see them doing<br />
anything to the horse, and well... hopefully they&#039;ll let us off lightly<br />
for helping them with their wounded..."</p>
<p>She looked up into his eyes.</p>
<p>"I&#039;m sorry for getting us in this mess... I&#039;ll figure out a way of making it up to you..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Oh, don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m quite used to it!" said Cain.  "I think<br />
they&#039;d pretty much forgive us anything for the ability to heal.  I<br />
mean, that toast - &#039;to salvation&#039;?  They see us as their saviours!"</p>
<p>He paused for a moment.  "Well, they see you as a saviour,<br />
anyway.  Who knows what they think of me.  Fuddle or not,<br />
they&#039;re probably suspicious..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra shifted a little.</p>
<p>"I won&#039;t let anything happen to you..." she said, with a determined<br />
look in her eyes. "Besides, they probably think you&#039;re their saviour<br />
too... either way, once their injured are better we can move on..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"I guess so," said Cain.  "But I do wonder if they&#039;re expecting<br />
all their wounded to be miraculously restored to health.  Even<br />
with what little I know...  Some of them aren&#039;t going to make it,<br />
are they?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra shrugged non-committally, "I don&#039;t know, depends how much they<br />
wanna stay alive I guess. Kinda hard to predict with infected stuff...<br />
especially when it&#039;s an area you didn&#039;t specialise in at all... makes<br />
me wish they had mental problems really, least then I could definitely<br />
say whether they&#039;ll be ok."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"How long do you think it&#039;ll be?" asked Cain.  "Until they&#039;re all<br />
either well or dead, I mean.  I quite enjoyed the riding through<br />
the forest and sleeping under the trees part of this adventure,<br />
but...  These people want us to stay here.  Forever.  So<br />
we&#039;re going to have to find some point when they won&#039;t mind us leaving<br />
so much..."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>"I shouldn&#039;t imagine it&#039;ll be more than a couple of days... some of<br />
them seemed pretty close to death already, so we&#039;ll probably be making<br />
it easier for them..." she said, looking at a spot on the floor. "I<br />
guess it&#039;ll be palliative measures and feverfew and hope. Either way, I<br />
don&#039;t wanna stay here forever." She looked into his eyes "I wanna ride<br />
around with you and snuggle and do stuff. I liked being on the scary<br />
death creature with you, it didn&#039;t feel so scary." She slid down from<br />
her perch in his arms and picked his hand up, still looking him in the<br />
eye.</p>
<p>"If the sick look better in three days time maximum then we&#039;ll go,<br />
whether or not they&#039;re willing to let us. You&#039;re more important to me."</p>
