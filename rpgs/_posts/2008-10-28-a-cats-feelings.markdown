<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra had been waiting patiently for what seemed like forever in<br />
Regara&#039;s castle. She had near to no idea how long cain and abel would<br />
be on their travels with house poppy but she knew that if they didn&#039;t<br />
return soon they&#039;d miss out completely on seeing the cool thing she&#039;d<br />
discovered. Come to think of it, didn&#039;t that sound suspiciously like<br />
them returning... curious, she looked out the window and saw her best<br />
friend and his brother. She smiled, put on her honeysuckle yellow<br />
slippers (to match the dress don&#039;tcha know) and ran down the stairs<br />
shouting &#8220;ABEL ABEL!!!! YOU&#039;LL NEVER GUESS WHAT I FOUND!!!&#8221; as she<br />
reached the party abel watched her jumping and shouting for joy<br />
answering &#8220;hmm?&#8221; she calmed down perceptibly &#8220;meanie! But it&#039;s just SO<br />
cool!!!&#8221; Noticing other people she visibly calmed down, realized she<br />
was being glared at, and (blushing while) facing Duchess Regara &#8220;good<br />
day your grace, i hope your journey went well... you&#039;ve lost a lot of<br />
weight... what happened? (bites her tongue before saying anything else<br />
remembering the last time she made the comment of &#8220;what happened, lost<br />
the food cart?&#8221;)&#8221; receiving an extremely scathing look from Regara.<br />
Looking around, she locates cain, &#8220;hello cain&#8221; she almost whispers, her<br />
shyness overcoming all her desire to be friendly... she then quickly<br />
hides behind abel who just pats her on the head. &#8220;why can&#039;t they just<br />
get married&#8221; thinks regara &#8220;cos then i&#039;d have the allegiance of house<br />
honeysuckle.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Cain bows politely to Ilandra, and turns towards the castle<br />
gates.  But, as he turns, is that the faintest shimmer of crimson<br />
to his cheeks...?</p>
<p>Abel&#039;s head slowly turns back and forth, his gaze falling alternately<br />
on the young girl and his brother and a sigh escaping from his<br />
lips.  He slaps his forehead with his hand, and refocuses his<br />
tired eyes on the still incessantly bouncing Ilandra.</p>
<p>"Fine, fine," he says with a tinge of weariness in his voice.  "Let&#039;s go see your shiny thing."</p>
<p>Duchess Regara and her personal servant, the almost entirely un-enigmatically named Mister Chicken, share a knowing glance.</p>
<p>"Finally," the Duchess whispers, "it might be time to sew up the loose ends."</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra takes Abel to his room, pausing briefly outside to blindfold<br />
him and intimate that she&#039;s done the same "present" for his brother. A<br />
feeling of dread creeps up on Abel.<br />
Ilandra guides him carefully into his room and removes the blindfold,<br />
revealing how she&#039;s redecorated his room in his favourite colours. She<br />
fidgets as she says "...only problem is... I&#039;m not sure what Cain&#039;s<br />
favourite colours are... so i made his room look like the glade where<br />
we first met..."<br />
Abel sighs, half smiling and replies sarcastically "What? You mean the<br />
one where you dumped a water bomb on his head?" she looks hurt so he<br />
hastily adds "thanks though" his gaze rests upon a hamper of cakes next<br />
to his bed featuring his favourite foods, a card and Ilandra&#039;s paw<br />
print signature. "Let me guess, you gave him my favourite food as well?"<br />
Blushing, she replies, "No, I gave him some of the same type of cake he<br />
got covered in during the post-saining banquet food fight"<br />
Rolling his eyes and trying not to laugh at his friend he replies "oh how did i not guess(!)"<br />
"Oh yeah... I also decorated your mother&#039;s room" she replies, more<br />
bubbly despite his sarcastic remarks. Having known him for several<br />
millenia, she&#039;s more than used to this by now... after all, they&#039;ve<br />
been best friends since they went into pre-saining together.<br />
From across the castle a piercing scream resounds and Ilandra once<br />
again finds herself the subject of a critical gaze from Abel. She<br />
blushes and fidgets uncomfortably.<br />
"You know those circus mirrors that warp your reflection?" she pipes<br />
up, " well i ran out of normal ones and i took the ones in your mothers<br />
wardrobe and hung them on the wall to make her room a shrine to her<br />
beauty. They were supposed to make her look thin... I guess she&#039;s not<br />
used to it..."<br />
"We&#039;ll see later..." he says, squeezing her shoulder to reassure her as<br />
she starts burbling about how he hopes his brother won&#039;t hate her for<br />
his room and poetry either...<br />
[<font>Private<br />
to GM: Regara&#039;s walls are a beautiful shade of sunset and on each wall<br />
is a small poem to her beauty, an example of which would be along the<br />
lines of "oh, your wondrous mouth, beautiful when encompassing a<br />
chocolate bar, and when lost in the moment you enjoy, the chocolate<br />
tries to dedicate an ode to your fantabulous chin" on cain&#039;s pillow is<br />
a little sonnet written by Ilandra, telling him a little of how she<br />
feels written using all the skill she has</font>]</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Whilst Ilandra and Abel talk in his room, elsewhere in the castle...</p>
<p>The Duchess stands stunned for a moment just inside the threshold of<br />
her room, before moving gingerly across the floor as if she were<br />
negotiating a minefield.  Her eyes dart across the, for want of a<br />
better word, poetry that adorns the walls, and finally come to rest on<br />
the sight of her own reflection.  Her image in the mirror bears<br />
the twenty-six inch waistline she so desired, but it inflates the image<br />
of the rest of her body to twice its normal size.</p>
<p>If looks could kill, her glare qould be murderous.<br />
This is fairyland, after all.<br />
The mirror in front of her smashes into a thousand tiny fragments.</p>
<p>With that, she storms out of the room, shouting and hollering for her servants.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in his room, Cain treads similarly carefully across the<br />
what-was-once-carpet of his what-was-once-a-room.  He takes a good<br />
look around, grabs the solitary piece of paper left lying on the<br />
cushion of his... what-was-once-his-bed, leaves the room and shuts the<br />
door tightly behind him.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Ilandra stands and waits for the Duchess to reach the room where she<br />
and Abel are now waiting in silent expectation. Ilandra knows that<br />
somehow she can&#039;t wriggle her way out of this one. Abel diverts his<br />
attention away from her for a second which is time enough for her to<br />
change into a cat and leave the room, and evidently also her clothes<br />
behind, as she slinks out of the door Regara comes storming in.</p>
<p>Regara looks around and finds no trace of Ilandra other than a small<br />
pile of Honeysuckle dress and shoes. Fuming she screams at Abel and<br />
throws a tantrum of epic proportions... "apparently it&#039;s his fault<br />
now...ok" thinks Ilandra.</p>
<p>Having safely got far enough away that she need not fear Regara&#039;s wrath<br />
she transforms back from cat form. She starts towards her room to get a<br />
different dress on and to send a letter to her parents and crashes<br />
unceremoniously into Cain. She begins to apologize and notices the<br />
crimson hue of his face. "I left my dress behind, didn&#039;t I? Dammit!"<br />
she thinks, matching the shade of his face. She concentrates for a<br />
second and is covered in tabby fur, but it&#039;s too late, the damage has<br />
been done. At this she bursts into tears and runs into her room. "Why?<br />
Why can I not seem sophisticated when I need to be?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Somewhat miffed, the Duchess stomps back to her throne room and sits down heavily, sighing as she does so.<br />
"That damn kid," she mutters to herself.  "Will she ever stop mocking me?"<br />
"Who can say, ma&#039;am?" Mister Chicken responds from next to the throne.  "Maybe marriage might calm her down."<br />
"Indeed."</p>
<p>Standing half-collapsed against the wall next to one of the castle&#039;s highest windows, Cain also mutters.<br />
"The fur...  She was...  Um..."</p>
<p>A few minutes after her arrival there, Ilandra hears a knock at her<br />
door.  She opens it discovering Abel there with her clothes,<br />
freshly pressed, in his hands.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Ilandra</b></p>
<p>Tears still running down her cheeks she smiles weakly... and bursts<br />
into even louder tears. She ushers him into the room, barely able to<br />
string a sentence together.<br />
Seeing how upset Ilandra is, Abel put his arm on her shoulder and<br />
squeezes. She calms down a little and, sniffling laments her inability<br />
to keep her clothes when she needs them.<br />
"you weren&#039;t concentrating hard enough then?" he smiles and asks if<br />
she&#039;s seen his brother. At this Ilandra describes her encounter. Upon<br />
finishing she finds her friend convulsing with mirth on the floor. She<br />
kicks him gently in the side and tells him to stop mocking her... after<br />
so many years it&#039;s the least he could do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they&#039;re interrupted by a servant who&#039;s just entered to<br />
inform them that the meal will be commencing in 15 minutes and that<br />
they are expected to be there.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>"Fair enough," Abel replies, picking himself up off the floor.<br />
"I&#039;d better head back to my room to change.  See you there!"<br />
With that Abel bows, turns and leaves, shutting the door to Ilandra&#039;s room quietly behind him.</p>
