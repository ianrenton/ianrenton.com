<p><i>This is an in-character game thread from <a href="../changeling-in-love-and-war">Changeling: In Love and War</a>.  (This page is not Creative Commons licenced.)</i></p>
<p><b>Storyteller</b></p>
<p>Darkness closed in over the Poppy kingdom, but the effect was all but lost in the faintly candle-lit confines of the <s>Bat</s> <s>Chicken</s> Raccoon Cave.  Down in the bowels of Castle Poppy Nyano paced back<br />
and forth, occasionally stopping to stare up at the bulk of the Dream<br />
Extractor.  The manuals for the thing were scattered around the<br />
place, with occasional pages of seemingly greater relevance pinned up<br />
about the walls.</p>
<p>One page in particular posed an issue for Nyano, and this he held<br />
between his paws as he paced.  That soup was the fuel for this<br />
particular device was obvious, but this page consisted almost entirely<br />
of a mammoth formula by which one calculated the broccoli-to-cream<br />
ratio.  Too little, and the victi- er, target&#039;s brain would be<br />
reduced to the consistency of cream.  Too much and, according to<br />
the calculations...  A race of broccoli-based super-beings would<br />
take over the world!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p><i>I wish Hugh was here, he understands soup.</i> Thought Nyano as he paced.</p>
<p>Eventually he decided to stop worrying. He knew the man to ask, he made<br />
a motion to  one of grim faced men the men who were busily having<br />
a thousand yard stare competition with the equally grim faced chickens<br />
that lurked in the corners of the cave.</p>
<p>Nyano muttered a few words in the man&#039;s ear, and then sat down to wait.</p>
<p>In less than ten minutes the man returned, bundling in front of him a<br />
shorter man whose face was covered by a black bag with a zip down the<br />
side.</p>
<p>Once the bag was removed, it turned out to be Gustaffson&#039;s assistant Heisenburg.</p>
<p>Nyano tried not to be too disturbed by the look in the man&#039;s eyes as he passed him the sheet of paper.</p>
<p>"Explain this for me would you?"</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Nyano-Sgiathatch</b></p>
<p>The confused lackey blinked for a moment, clearly he was expecting a more threatening demand from his erstwhile captor.</p>
<p>Then he glanced down at the paperwork and easily deduced the answer to the question.</p>
<p>He directed Nyano&#039;s eyes down to three little letters at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><i>P.T.O.</i></p>
<p>Overleaf was the simple result to the equation. You needed 2pi parts brocolli to 10 parts cream.</p>
<p>Nyano let out a sigh of relief at no longer carrying the weight of<br />
being the sole person capable of defending Faerie from the depredations<br />
of the superenhanced broccoli people.</p>
<p>It was at this point that Mr Chicken stepped over, appearing out of the<br />
shadows like some harbinger of an apocalypse of insanity.</p>
<p>"Cluck, Master Nyano, there is a cluck messenger for waiting for you. I<br />
cluck, found him in the Maze of Atria, I don&#039;t know how long he&#039;s been<br />
there."</p>
<p>Nyano thrusts the paperwork at Mr chicken with one hand, whilst simultaneously waving at Heisenburg with the other.</p>
<p>"Could you take care of this for me? The machine is supposed to be used<br />
to pay the bill Herr Gusstaffsen gave us. I think that guy knows how it<br />
works"</p>
<p>Then he headed for the exit as quickly as he could, his men filing in behind him.</p>
<p>It didn&#039;t take him long to find the messenger amongst the myriad marble<br />
pillars and coloured water pipes that filled the Maze of Atria, the<br />
poor man had made himself a base camp at the point where an series of<br />
pillars had collapsed against an indigo water fountain.</p>
<p>By the state of the fire pit and washing line, he&#039;d been here some time.</p>
<p>When Nyano approached, he could see the young man packing up his things.<br />
"Are you Nyano-Sgiathatch? The pooka said you&#039;d be along soon to get me out of here."</p>
<p>Nyano smiled at him.<br />
"You&#039;ve got a message for me?"</p>
<p>The messenger&#039;s face fell.<br />
"You&#039;re not going to like it. Can you get me out of here before I give it to you?"</p>
<p>The raccoon looked worried for a moment, but decided that in the end it didn&#039;t matter.</p>
<p>"You&#039;re in luck, I&#039;ve never been lost in my life. We&#039;ll be out of here in a jiffy."</p>
<p>Nyano marched off in a random direction with a glint in his eye, the poor messenger stumbling after him.</p>
<p>It didn&#039;t take them long to locate a Jiffy, which is a bit like a sedan<br />
chair, but carried by little pink unicorns, and the party climbed<br />
aboard.</p>
<p>Then Nyano leaned over the edge and declared<br />
"To the great hall!"</p>
<p>The Jiffy was only too keen to comply, and soon they were moving at quite a clip.</p>
<p>Along the way, Nyano turned to the messenger and asked. With eyes suddenly turned serious.</p>
<p>"So what is the message?"</p>
<p>"It&#039;s about your father."<br />
The raccoon clutched the velvet cushion he was sat in so hard that his fingers began to ache.</p>
<p>"What about my father?"</p>
<p>"Rumour has it, that a raccoon matching his description was seen by a<br />
servant in the court of duke Hyacynth&#039;s palace, I don&#039;t know any more."</p>
<p>So it was, that later that night one lonely Raccoon headed out into the<br />
night, his worldly possessions tied in a large polka-dotted<br />
handkerchief on the end of his spear. Heading towards Hyacynth kingdom,<br />
and a destiny that he didn&#039;t even begin to understand.</p>
